      <description>Nikito sat alone in the cell thinking about how miserable she was. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that much different than the loneliness that she felt in the orphanage. Here however instead of the watchful eye of the care tenders she had bars to keep her from escaping. The food was worse too. In an orphanage since she was 2 she did not remember her mother who died of a drug overdose. Now at 17 she was in jail for the latest in her string of mischievous deeds.</description>

She was an excellent teacher, mostly due to the great love she had for her students. She had studied hard throughout her years in public school and then gone on to study at university, and all that time she had harbored a dark, twisted, little secret. Samantha Hargraves loved little girls.</description>
