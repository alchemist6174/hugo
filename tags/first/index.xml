      <description>The rich can buy anything in America. Knowing this, one clever entrepenuer started a service for gentlemen called The Girl-of-the-Month Club. For a fee, you could subscribe to have a different teen or preteen girl, delivered to your house for an overnight sexual fantasy. Each month you would receive a different girl, dressed to provide the fantasy. This is the story of one year in the life of Blake Winthope and how he enjoyed his subscription. Part 4 is about April&amp;#39;s Child, The Virgin Mary. An eleven-year old girl, dressed as a nun uses Blake to take her virginity.</description>
