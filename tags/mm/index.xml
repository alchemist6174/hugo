      <description>&amp;ldquo;Its time to get up, sugar.&amp;rdquo;
It was Saturday. Punishment day as she thought about it. Training day as her Daddy (Steve) thought of it. She shrugged off the awakening and noticed that already the tiny latex catsuit he had for her was laid out. Complete with gloves and feet. She had come to love it. Three weeks prior she had been introduced to it. Each of the 3 preceding Saturdays it had been adorned with a crotch piece that had two distinct members.</description>

&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to soak in a tub of hot water,&amp;rdquo; I said, grabbing one of the mugs and heading to the bathroom.
&amp;ldquo;The tub&amp;rsquo;s ready for you,&amp;rdquo; Fran said. &amp;ldquo;Make sure the water&amp;rsquo;s not too hot before you get in.</description>
