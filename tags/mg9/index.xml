      <description>A story of a neighbor girl who pretends to be a monkey, and the man who fancies to her. This is the third story in my &amp;#39;little animal&amp;#39; series, which began with &amp;#39;The Little Kitty-Cat&amp;#39; and continued with &amp;#39;The Little Puppy-Dog&amp;#39;; This story can be read by itself or you can start with &amp;#39;The Little Kitty-Cat&amp;#39; to get a better idea of the progression of their relationship. Coming next, &amp;#39;The Little Bunny-Rabbit.&amp;#39; Many thanks to arcticwlfe62543 for suggesting that the girl should pretend to be a monkey--if you have ideas for other animals you&amp;#39;d like to see in this series, post them and I&amp;#39;ll try my best!</description>
