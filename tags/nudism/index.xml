      <description>Chapter 1 My name is Roy and I was 15 years old at the time of this story. This is the story of a wonderful afternoon I enjoyed last year with my cousin Shelley and some of her friends.
Shelley was then 10, and we have grown up together almost as brother and sister. In fact, we have been closer than most brothers and sisters in many ways, not least because our families are nudists.</description>
