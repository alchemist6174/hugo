      <description>I gave my clear-eyed boy a star
Of clematis from summer days
That dwelt among the scented ways
Of an old garden still and far:
So that it lights his dreams with truth From that walled garden of my youth,
I gave my clear-eyed boy a star.
I gave my soft-haired boy a crown
Of olives from the groves of Greece,
That all life&amp;rsquo;s passions turn to peace
For him, and perilous paths lead down</description>

      <title>The Waning Of Love</title>

      <description>I.
To love thee brings me sadness, for I know
each time the time will never come again, &amp;ndash;
that every moment brings the darker stain
of riper manhood. Liker as we grow,
Love stirs its wings, impatient to remain.
II.
Each night of such a love from such a love doth part
thy forward-looking self. At each remove
from boyhood thou art further from my love,
though nearer to the knowledge of my heart.</description>

      <description>Very short. Even if poetry is not your thing, give it a try - well, if pedo feelings are your thing!</description>

      <description>A fiery glance has never yet betrayed.
Hold the man&amp;rsquo;s heart in your unversed child&amp;rsquo;s fingers,
draw the man&amp;rsquo;s streaming fire into the icy staterooms of your eyes!
You are as certain of love as you are of the kingdom of heaven.
He will give you his heart, a kingdom and all the flowers of spring,
and you will give him the light veil of your longing that makes the distance blue.</description>

      <title>On A Child-Bride&#39;s Wedding Night</title>
      <link>https://alchemist6174.github.io/hugo/posts/englishperv6202/</link>

      <description>Sentiments and imagery of an adult male&amp;#39;s wedding night with his child-bride. Her age is left for guessing, but descriptions of her should be a good clue. Also, there is no hint of how this marriage could have come about, only that it has and that the man determines to enjoy it.</description>

      <description>A public haunt they found her in:
She lay asleep, a lovely child;
The only thing left undefiled
Where all things else bore taint of sin.
Her supple outlines fixed in clay
The universal law suspend,
And turn Time&amp;rsquo;s chariot back, and blend
A thousand years with yesterday.
A sinless touch, austere yet warm,
Around her girlish figures pressed,
Caught the sweet imprint of her breast,
And held her, surely clasped, from harm.</description>

      <description>My first attempt at poetry. Please don&amp;#39;t be too critical. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to rhyme, right? It may seem clunky but I think the rhythm works out. It&amp;#39;s not a story, but I&amp;#39;m hoping there&amp;#39;s enough aesthetics in this - plus vile imagery - to keep everyone happy!</description>

      <title>A Girl, Some Crayons</title>

      <description>A girl, some crayons
Head angled down
Tilted to elongate the slope of the neck
The sweet slope of the neck
Ending in shoulders, divine
And a softly rising chest
I am drawn
Pulled
Sure as the pull of the Earth
I am hypnotized
A soft breath calls me back
Eyes focused
Crayon-fist staying in the lines
Hair falling
A few strands
And then more
Holy light radiates
One finger, quick</description>

      <description>Earth goddess child, spirit of moonlight wild
Bless the earth with your footsteps, and more I beg
Bless the starlight with your eyes reflecting, your glittering lights
Hush the chaos with your soft-drumming heart
Earth goddess child, incarnation of moonlight wild
Heal an aching soul with your laughter singing, your murmuring magic
Holy and sacred and sky-clad you shimmer, and glimmer and shine
Goosebumps sprout in your winding wake
The moonlight will come to worship you in your purring sleep</description>

      <description>Under the green rushes your heart beats like a pagan drum
The shadows shape you by day
Watch evening fall like a darkening cloak with murmur and hum
Now comes the road and the way
Clad but in the night-sky your pale limbs leap and flash in flight
A call turns the wheels of your heart
Rushing to unspoken wishes you come a fleshy dream in the night
Aimed so true, an unerring dart</description>

      <description>It is her forbidden fruit,
That&amp;rsquo;s what I crave.
Hidden so well between hairless lips of her sex.
I continuously find myself lost,
With no guide, searching anyway.
She plays with me,
Appearing in many guises
Yet I continue on my quest,
Even though at times,
I&amp;rsquo;ve felt led astray.
I strengthen with every step.
Hoping to find those consummations,
So fruitful with passion.
Nourishing the vitality of my spirit,</description>

first (&amp;lsquo;don&amp;rsquo;t tell your mother&amp;rsquo;) had;
making annie slightly bad
but very wonderful in bed
saints and satyrs, go your way youths and maidens: let us pray</description>
