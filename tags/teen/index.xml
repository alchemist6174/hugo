      <description>Hi there, I&amp;#39;m Daisy, today I had a great day with my Daddy helping out at his Camera Club, so I&amp;#39;m going to write all about it in my diary so I don&amp;#39;t forget. I always forget stuff, Daddy says I&amp;#39;m a silly dumb blonde girl but I don&amp;#39;t mind because he always gives me a really big hug when he says it.</description>
