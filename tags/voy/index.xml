      <description>The rich can buy anything in America. Knowing this, one clever entrepenuer started a service for gentlemen called The Girl-of-the-Month Club. For a fee, you could subscribe to have a different teen or preteen girl, delivered to your house for an overnight sexual fantasy. Each month you would receive a different girl, dressed to provide the fantasy. This is the story of one year in the life of Blake Winthope and how he enjoyed his subscription. Part 2 is about February&amp;#39;s Child, The Cheerleader. Fourteen-year-old Wendy gives Blake a new appreciation of the splits.</description>

      <description>The neighbor girl became good friends with Karl and his wife. She even volunteered to babysit their little daughter. What changes took place and what events unfolded that brought this young man to accept her proposition to marry him? Note: there is some Russian included in the story to make it more believable--but the translations are always there. (If you don&amp;#39;t want the story part, skip down to the action, say Chapter 8 through the end.)</description>
