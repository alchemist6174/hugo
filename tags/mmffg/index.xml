      <description>Mom convinced me and my wife, Anna, to let Gramps, Mom&amp;rsquo;s father, move in with us. I was later told that she had a much harder time convincing him to move in with us. He loved living alone. It was a good deal for us, because he paid the rent and utilities in exchange for a roof over his head and food on the table. But he also wound up doing most of the cooking and cleaning and the taking care of our 7-year-old daughter, Electra.</description>
