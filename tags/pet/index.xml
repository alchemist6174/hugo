      <description>This is episode 3 in my spin-off from my long-running &amp;#39;pedo ring&amp;#39; series, which featured a rugged and fairly good-looking pedo called Sean and 9yo Hannah as the central characters. Now, he has had to start all over again. The first paragraph of each episode summarizes what&amp;#39;s gone on before, so can be enjoyed separately. Go to the first episode, &amp;#39;Ravenous Pedo, Available Little Girl&amp;#39;, for a fuller description of her, but there are little reminders of her looks here.</description>
