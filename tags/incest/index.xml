      <description>Samantha Hargraves loved being a teacher, it was all she had dreamed of being since she was a little girl. She was an excellent teacher, mostly due to the great love she had for her students. She had studied hard throughout her years in public school and then gone on to study at university, and all that time she had harbored a dark, twisted, little secret. Samantha Hargraves loved little girls.</description>
