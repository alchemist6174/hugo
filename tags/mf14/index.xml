      <description>The neighbor girl became good friends with Karl and his wife. She even volunteered to babysit their little daughter. What changes took place and what events unfolded that brought this young man to accept her proposition to marry him? Note: there is some Russian included in the story to make it more believable--but the translations are always there. (If you don&amp;#39;t want the story part, skip down to the action, say Chapter 8 through the end.)</description>
