  "articleBody": "I am having a wonderful dream, I’m getting a great blowjob from a fabulous blond babe and I’m getting close. She is swirling her tongue around the head and up and down the bottom of my shaft. She fondles my balls, which always gets me really going. I reach down, grab her head, and start to face fuck her. As I cum deep down her throat, I groan and wake. It isn’t a dream. It’s my 24-year-old stepdaughter Dagny.\nWhat the Fuck! I damn near jump out of bed. “Wha..what are you doing??” I stammer.\nShe swallows, and grins, “Just saying thank you, Daddy.”\n“Bu…but you’re my daughter!”\n“Not really, Daddy. Besides, I remember how you used to look at me when I lived here.”\nShe’s right, she used to walk around the house half clothed when she was a teenager. I couldn’t help but look at her perky little tits, nipples hard and poking thru her short t-shirts. She seemed to delight in giving me little glimpses of her tits as she leaned over in front of me or letting her skimpy thong under ware ride up, then she would pull them slowly free from her gooey wet snatch when she knew I was looking. “At least I never touched you,” I mumble.\n“I wish you had, Daddy. You were so hot, and still are.”\nShe starts to suck me hard again, cleaning up her mess. God, I don’t know. I know I should kick her out, but she was a hot little 16-year-old, even if she is a skanky 24-year-old now. I lie back, close my eyes and remember the old Dagny.\nThis time she stops before I cum. She climbs up to fuck me, but I stop her for a moment. I hand her a condom from the nightstand. There’s no telling, and I doubt she even knows, where her cunt has been. She unrolls the condom on me, quicker and easier than I ever have. Ah, she does have a professional touch. She is hot and wet though as she slides down on me slowly. She groans “Oh, Daddy” as she hits bottom.\nI grab her tits as she slides up and down my cock slowly at first then faster and faster. I groan too, slide my hands down to her hips, and throw her onto the bed. I loom over her as she grins up at me. “I have wanted to do this for years,” I admit. I plunge deep in her gaping cunt and pound her hard. It’s a good thing she blew me first, I want to make this last.\nShe grunts and moans as I slam into her, my balls bouncing off her asshole. Her skinny body is pinned beneath me as I fulfill a very deep and evil fantasy. I pinch her nipples and bite her shoulder. She squeals and yells “YES, DADDY! YES!!”\nHer cunt is hot and still fairly tight even after having Stephanie and who knows how many other fat cocks in her. I flip her over and slam into her from behind. I feel my cock bouncing off her cervix as I grab her tits and let her have it deep and fast. Then I think of something that might be tighter.\nI slide out for a moment as she moans “Don’t stop…” I grab my cock and slide it up her ass in one deep hard thrust. It is tight and hot. She just groans and pushes back onto me. I grab her hips and fuck her ass hard. This is something even her mother never let me do. My hips slam into her ass as she moans louder and louder. I spank her sorry white ass and turn it red. She grunts with each spank as I pummel her harder and harder. She’s both sobbing and playing with herself. My balls bounce off her fingers as she rubs her clit. She wails and quivers as she cums hard. Her ass vibrates and I can’t stand it anymore and give her one last deep thrust and explode deep in her ass. We collapse in a tangle of sweaty limbs as I slide out of her now gaping ass. We’re both gasping for breath when I hear a giggle from the door.\nStephanie, Dag’s four-year-old daughter, is watching us, sucking her thumb and grinning around it at both of us.\nGod, how did I get into this?\n***\nThe phone rang at three in the morning. This can’t be good. “Hello” I croaked.\n“Daddy?”\nThere was only one person who called me Daddy, and she wasn’t even my daughter. My ex-step-daughter Dagny was on the phone and she sounded drunk, even with just one word.\n“Do you know what time it is?!”\n“I’m sorry, Daddy,” she slurred, “I’m in trouble.”\nSo what else is new, I thought. “What’s wrong this time,” I asked.\n“Billy kicked me out,” then she burst into tears.\nI hate it when she cries and she knows it. “What about Stephanie?” I asked. Stephanie was my only granddaughter and the only reason I hadn’t hung up on her. I also noted that Dag hadn’t mentioned her little four-year-old daughter until I did.\n“She’s asleep in the car. Can we come and stay with you tonight?”\nShit. “I guess. We can sort all of this out in the morning. Can you drive?”\n“Yeah, I’m fine,” she slurred.\nI thought about going to get the two of them, but they only lived half a mile away. Fuck it. “I’ll make up the spare room.”\nI got up and made coffee, made the bed in my spare bedroom and unlocked the back door. Dagny used to have a key, but I changed the locks after valuables started to disappear from around the house. Just what I need, another junky in the house. That’s why I divorced her mother. Shit.\n***\nI was waiting in the kitchen when they stumbled in the back door. Dag had a nice shiner and a split lip. Her hair was its usual stringy blonde mess and looked like a poster child for meth abuse. She was dragging my almost sleepwalking granddaughter by one arm. Dag collapsed in a kitchen chair and I grabbed Stephanie and pulled her into my lap. Steph was back asleep within seconds.\n“Thanks, Dad,” was all Dagny said.\n“So, what happened?”\n“Billy came home drunk and beat me up.”\n“Looks like. I’ll get you some ice for that eye.”\n“Nah, it’s fine. I’ve got these.” She pulled a couple of pills from her pocket and downed them with a mouthful of my coffee.\n“He kicked you out?”\n“Yeah, the bastard…didn’t even let me grab anything. He chased me out of there with a shotgun.”\n“We’ll sort it out tomorrow. I’m just glad you and Steph are safe.” Well, Steph anyway.\n“Yeah, whatever.” Then she got up and staggered to the guest room, leaving Steph in my lap. Typical.\nI looked down at Steph. It looked like she hadn’t had a bath in a week and quite frankly stank. She was awfully skinny, too. Well, I’ll clean her up in the morning and give her a good breakfast, too.\nI carried Steph to the guest room. Dagny was passed out fully clothed half on the bed and half off. I rolled her onto the double bed and pulled off her shoes. Her feet stank too. I put Steph down next to her. Steph whimpered and tried to hang onto me. I threw a spare blanket over both of them, since there was no point in tucking them in and dirtying the fresh sheets. I turned out the light and went back to bed.\n***\nAfter that marathon fuck session, I come to and the clock says 10:43 AM. Dag is curled up next to me and asleep again. I lean over and start to kiss her, but she smells like a like a combination latrine, whorehouse and brewery. I get up to pee and throw on my robe.\nI look in on Stephanie who is back asleep curled up in the guest bed sucking her thumb. I lean over and kiss her forehead. She stinks too, but smiles around her thumb then goes back to sucking.\nAfter peeing, I avoid looking at myself in the mirror. I don’t think I can look myself in the eye after last night. I zap myself some leftover coffee and sit down in the kitchen.\nIf it was just Dag, I’d kick her ass out in a second, but I won’t let my only granddaughter go homeless. That’s a joke, too, though. Stephanie’s real father and both grandfathers are long gone and I am no blood relation to either of them. But Steph’s only a kid and certainly didn’t pick her worthless mother.\nNow, that wish fulfillment sex was nice, I must admit, but Dag is almost my daughter. I shouldn’t let that happen again.\nThe more I think about it, the more I wonder what is really going on. There’s no way I’ll ever get a straight answer out of Dag, so I call Billy. He answers on the first ring.\n“Hello?” he mumbles, sounding hungover.\n“This is Ed Taylor.”\n“What you want?” he manages.\n“Dagny ended up over here last night. What’s going on?”\n“I caught that bitch in my bed with some fucking nigger is what’s going on!” he yells, finding his voice. “You can tell that fucking race traitor skank don’t come back!”\n“Huh, well, I see. Sorry about that, I guess.” Like mother like daughter. Her mother had a taste for dark meat too. And it’s just like Dagny to hang around with some skinhead trash. “Look, can I come over and get their things.”\n“Fine, but if I see that bitch, I’m grabbing my gun.”\n“Well, OK, then. I’ll stop by this afternoon.”\n***\nI start to make some bacon, eggs and toast when Dagny appears at the door. She looked still looked like hell even with a just fucked up the ass glow: stringy blond hair, long face, a circle under one eye and a shiner under the other. She looks skinnier than I remember, too.\n“You want any breakfast?” I ask.\nShe turns a little green and runs for the bathroom.\nShe reappears a few minutes later. “Coffee” is all she says, then sits down and drinks mine.\nI finish making breakfast and pour myself another cup. I sit down across from her. She steals a piece of my toast. “I called Billy. He’s not very happy with you.”\n“Fuck him.”\n“He said he doesn’t want to see you. I could run over there and pick up your stuff, if you want.”\n“Whatever.” She grabs her purse from where she dropped it last night rummaging around in it. “Got any cigarettes?”\nI shake my head, “Gave them up when your mother left.”\n“Good for you. I’d kill for one.” She gets up and heads out the door without so much as a “see you later” or “look after Stephanie.”\n***\nI’m still eating breakfast when Stephanie wanders in a while later.\n“Branka?” she mumbles, one small fist rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. She never could say Grampa when she was two and my nickname stuck.\n“Good morning” I manage. I’m not sure what to say to her. She just climbs into my lap and grabs a piece of my bacon “Are you hungry?” I ask?\nShe nods her head and eats what’s left of my breakfast. When that’s gone, I ask her “More?” and she nods again. I try to put her down as I get up, but she won’t let go, wrapping her arms and legs around me. I had made enough food for the three of us, so I dish up the rest and pour her some milk, all one handed. After a couple of one-handed trips with food and the milk, we sit down with Steph in my lap again.\nSteph eats like she’s starving. She eats everything on the plate. I manage to get half a strip of bacon and some toast past her. When there’s nothing left, she burps then giggles.\n“I saw you watching us earlier,” I finally say. “Do you watch mama with men very often?”\nShe nods. “Sometimes I help, too.” She claps her hand over her mouth then says “Oops, I’m not supposed to say.”\nGod, I am conflicted, but my even darker side wins out. “That’s right, baby.”\nI grab a napkin and change the subject. “You made a bit of a mess, darling” I say as I wipe her mouth. “Uh-oh, I made a clean spot. I think you need a bath.”\nShe makes a face, but doesn’t complain when I carry her to the bathroom. I start the tap and let the water warm up while I undress her. Her clothes are as filthy as she is. “When did you last take a bath, darling?”\n“I dunno,” she says and shrugs her shoulders. She sits on the edge of the tub as I pull off her tiny t-shirt and jeans. She isn’t even wearing any panties. I notice she had a bit of a rash between her legs. “I need to pee,” she adds.\nDagny hadn’t flushed her vomit (and my semen?), so I do. Then I put the toilet seat down and Steph climbs up and pees. She doesn’t bother to wipe herself until I hand her a wad of toilet paper. That explains the rash, I guess.\nThe water’s warm now and she climbs into the tub. I close the drain and it starts to fill. She plays with an empty shampoo bottle. “Sorry, darling, I don’t have any better toys to play with.” I turn her around and lean her back to put her hair under the tap. The water runs dirty out of her hair. Damn, no baby shampoo, either, so I grab my shampoo. I start a mental grocery list. I squirt some of my Pantene into her hair and start to lather it up. Actually, her hair is so dirty it wouldn’t lather at all. She tilts her head back and smiles up at me as I wash her hair.\n“Owwie” she says as I try to work out a few tangles.\n“Sorry, but your hair is very dirty. Here, lean back again.” She holds her hair under the tap and more dirt flows out. I add more shampoo and get a little lather this time. It takes three “Lather, Rinse, Repeat\"s to get her hair something like clean. I drain the filthy water and refill the tub. Then I start on the rest of her.\nI have to use a washcloth on her to scrub off all the grime. I remember the one time I was over at Dagny’s during bath time, she just dropped Steph in an inch of tepid water and let her play. She didn’t even use soap. It’s amazing the poor child survived this long.\nWhen I start to wash between her legs, she starts to cry.\n“Owwie, Branka, that hurts.”\n“Oh, sorry, darling.” I don’t want to hurt her, but she is awfully red down there. I guess I just have to use my hand. I soap up my hand and gently start to wash her red thighs and crotch. She lays back and spreads her legs wide. The rash is all over and I wash her as gently as I can. She lifts her little ass as I wash down between her crack and her little asshole. She starts to moan a bit. “Does that hurt, darling?”\n“No, Branka, that feels good.” She reaches down and spreads her little lips and says “Don’t forget inside, Billy says that’s the most important part.”\nWhat? Billy? What has that bastard been doing? I slide my fingers up and down her slit and I swear her little clit is hard. I notice she didn’t seem to have a hymen as my finger slips easily inside her. She lets out another groan. Her little cunt is warm and wet. I can’t believe my little four-year-old granddaughter isn’t a virgin. I don’t dare do anything more and I rinse her clean. She looks a little disappointed as I lift her out of the tub.\nI dry her in my softest towel, then her hair. I brush her hair out as best I can, getting quite a few more “owwies” in the process.\n“Steph, honey, you have an awful rash between your legs.”\n“Mommy said it’s OK” she replies.\n***\n“Here, let me some lotion on it” and I grab some hand lotion and start to smear it on.\nShe jumps a bit and giggles “That’s cold, Branka.”\n“Sorry, darling.” I add some better skin cream to my mental shopping list. I’ll have to ask what to get, I’m sure Dagny wouldn’t know.\nAs my hand smoothes the lotion around, she moaned “that feels good.” She squirms and holds my hand against her little cunt and smiles. I quickly pull my hand away and she frowns. “What’s wrong, Branka?”\n“Nothing,” I mutter.\nI realize that I don’t have any other clothes for her. I’ll have to stop by Billy’s and get her stuff this afternoon. I hope Dagny gets back soon so she can watch her.\nI wrap her in the towel and carry her into my room. I dig out one of her grandmother’s old t-shirts and put it on her. She’s smothered in it, but it’s all I have. “Here, hop up into bed and I’ll wash your old clothes.”\nI throw her little pile of clothes in the washer and add extra soap. When I get back to my bedroom, I can’t believe what I see.\nLittle Stephanie is playing with herself down there. She’s kicked off the comforter and pulled up the t-shirt. Her eyes are closed and moans as one little hand plays with her clit and the other slides in and out of her tiny cunt. I stand frozen in the doorway, then back out slowly and closing the door. I sit down in my office and try to think. What has this little girl been doing? What has her mother been doing? Should I report this??? My mind is spinning.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>I am having a wonderful dream, I&rsquo;m getting a great blowjob from a fabulous blond babe and I&rsquo;m getting close. She is swirling her tongue around the head and up and down the bottom of my shaft. She fondles my balls, which always gets me really going. I reach down, grab her head, and start to face fuck her. As I cum deep down her throat, I groan and wake. It isn&rsquo;t a dream. It&rsquo;s my 24-year-old stepdaughter Dagny.</p>
<p>What the Fuck! I damn near jump out of bed. &ldquo;Wha..what are you doing??&rdquo; I stammer.</p>
<p>She swallows, and grins, &ldquo;Just saying thank you, Daddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bu&hellip;but you&rsquo;re my daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really, Daddy. Besides, I remember how you used to look at me when I lived here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s right, she used to walk around the house half clothed when she was a teenager. I couldn&rsquo;t help but look at her perky little tits, nipples hard and poking thru her short t-shirts. She seemed to delight in giving me little glimpses of her tits as she leaned over in front of me or letting her skimpy thong under ware ride up, then she would pull them slowly free from her gooey wet snatch when she knew I was looking. &ldquo;At least I never touched you,&rdquo; I mumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you had, Daddy. You were so hot, and still are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She starts to suck me hard again, cleaning up her mess. God, I don&rsquo;t know. I know I should kick her out, but she was a hot little 16-year-old, even if she is a skanky 24-year-old now. I lie back, close my eyes and remember the old Dagny.</p>
<p>This time she stops before I cum. She climbs up to fuck me, but I stop her for a moment. I hand her a condom from the nightstand. There&rsquo;s no telling, and I doubt she even knows, where her cunt has been. She unrolls the condom on me, quicker and easier than I ever have. Ah, she does have a professional touch. She is hot and wet though as she slides down on me slowly. She groans &ldquo;Oh, Daddy&rdquo; as she hits bottom.</p>
<p>I grab her tits as she slides up and down my cock slowly at first then faster and faster. I groan too, slide my hands down to her hips, and throw her onto the bed. I loom over her as she grins up at me. &ldquo;I have wanted to do this for years,&rdquo; I admit. I plunge deep in her gaping cunt and pound her hard. It&rsquo;s a good thing she blew me first, I want to make this last.</p>
<p>She grunts and moans as I slam into her, my balls bouncing off her asshole. Her skinny body is pinned beneath me as I fulfill a very deep and evil fantasy. I pinch her nipples and bite her shoulder. She squeals and yells &ldquo;YES, DADDY! YES!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her cunt is hot and still fairly tight even after having Stephanie and who knows how many other fat cocks in her. I flip her over and slam into her from behind. I feel my cock bouncing off her cervix as I grab her tits and let her have it deep and fast. Then I think of something that might be tighter.</p>
<p>I slide out for a moment as she moans &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop&hellip;&rdquo; I grab my cock and slide it up her ass in one deep hard thrust. It is tight and hot. She just groans and pushes back onto me. I grab her hips and fuck her ass hard. This is something even her mother never let me do. My hips slam into her ass as she moans louder and louder. I spank her sorry white ass and turn it red. She grunts with each spank as I pummel her harder and harder. She&rsquo;s both sobbing and playing with herself. My balls bounce off her fingers as she rubs her clit. She wails and quivers as she cums hard. Her ass vibrates and I can&rsquo;t stand it anymore and give her one last deep thrust and explode deep in her ass. We collapse in a tangle of sweaty limbs as I slide out of her now gaping ass. We&rsquo;re both gasping for breath when I hear a giggle from the door.</p>
<p>Stephanie, Dag&rsquo;s four-year-old daughter, is watching us, sucking her thumb and grinning around it at both of us.</p>
<p>God, how did I get into this?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The phone rang at three in the morning. This can&rsquo;t be good. &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; I croaked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was only one person who called me Daddy, and she wasn&rsquo;t even my daughter. My ex-step-daughter Dagny was on the phone and she sounded drunk, even with just one word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what time it is?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Daddy,&rdquo; she slurred, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So what else is new, I thought. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong this time,&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy kicked me out,&rdquo; then she burst into tears.</p>
<p>I hate it when she cries and she knows it. &ldquo;What about Stephanie?&rdquo; I asked. Stephanie was my only granddaughter and the only reason I hadn&rsquo;t hung up on her. I also noted that Dag hadn&rsquo;t mentioned her little four-year-old daughter until I did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s asleep in the car. Can we come and stay with you tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shit. &ldquo;I guess. We can sort all of this out in the morning. Can you drive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she slurred.</p>
<p>I thought about going to get the two of them, but they only lived half a mile away. Fuck it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make up the spare room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I got up and made coffee, made the bed in my spare bedroom and unlocked the back door. Dagny used to have a key, but I changed the locks after valuables started to disappear from around the house. Just what I need, another junky in the house. That&rsquo;s why I divorced her mother. Shit.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I was waiting in the kitchen when they stumbled in the back door. Dag had a nice shiner and a split lip. Her hair was its usual stringy blonde mess and looked like a poster child for meth abuse. She was dragging my almost sleepwalking granddaughter by one arm. Dag collapsed in a kitchen chair and I grabbed Stephanie and pulled her into my lap. Steph was back asleep within seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Dad,&rdquo; was all Dagny said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy came home drunk and beat me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like. I&rsquo;ll get you some ice for that eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nah, it&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ve got these.&rdquo; She pulled a couple of pills from her pocket and downed them with a mouthful of my coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kicked you out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, the bastard&hellip;didn&rsquo;t even let me grab anything. He chased me out of there with a shotgun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sort it out tomorrow. I&rsquo;m just glad you and Steph are safe.&rdquo; Well, Steph anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, whatever.&rdquo; Then she got up and staggered to the guest room, leaving Steph in my lap. Typical.</p>
<p>I looked down at Steph. It looked like she hadn&rsquo;t had a bath in a week and quite frankly stank. She was awfully skinny, too. Well, I&rsquo;ll clean her up in the morning and give her a good breakfast, too.</p>
<p>I carried Steph to the guest room. Dagny was passed out fully clothed half on the bed and half off. I rolled her onto the double bed and pulled off her shoes. Her feet stank too. I put Steph down next to her. Steph whimpered and tried to hang onto me. I threw a spare blanket over both of them, since there was no point in tucking them in and dirtying the fresh sheets. I turned out the light and went back to bed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After that marathon fuck session, I come to and the clock says 10:43 AM. Dag is curled up next to me and asleep again. I lean over and start to kiss her, but she smells like a like a combination latrine, whorehouse and brewery. I get up to pee and throw on my robe.</p>
<p>I look in on Stephanie who is back asleep curled up in the guest bed sucking her thumb. I lean over and kiss her forehead. She stinks too, but smiles around her thumb then goes back to sucking.</p>
<p>After peeing, I avoid looking at myself in the mirror. I don&rsquo;t think I can look myself in the eye after last night. I zap myself some leftover coffee and sit down in the kitchen.</p>
<p>If it was just Dag, I&rsquo;d kick her ass out in a second, but I won&rsquo;t let my only granddaughter go homeless. That&rsquo;s a joke, too, though. Stephanie&rsquo;s real father and both grandfathers are long gone and I am no blood relation to either of them. But Steph&rsquo;s only a kid and certainly didn&rsquo;t pick her worthless mother.</p>
<p>Now, that wish fulfillment sex was nice, I must admit, but Dag is almost my daughter. I shouldn&rsquo;t let that happen again.</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more I wonder what is really going on. There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;ll ever get a straight answer out of Dag, so I call Billy. He answers on the first ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; he mumbles, sounding hungover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Ed Taylor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want?&rdquo; he manages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dagny ended up over here last night. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I caught that bitch in my bed with some fucking nigger is what&rsquo;s going on!&rdquo; he yells, finding his voice. &ldquo;You can tell that fucking race traitor skank don&rsquo;t come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, well, I see. Sorry about that, I guess.&rdquo; Like mother like daughter. Her mother had a taste for dark meat too. And it&rsquo;s just like Dagny to hang around with some skinhead trash. &ldquo;Look, can I come over and get their things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, but if I see that bitch, I&rsquo;m grabbing my gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, OK, then. I&rsquo;ll stop by this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I start to make some bacon, eggs and toast when Dagny appears at the door. She looked still looked like hell even with a just fucked up the ass glow: stringy blond hair, long face, a circle under one eye and a shiner under the other. She looks skinnier than I remember, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want any breakfast?&rdquo; I ask.</p>
<p>She turns a little green and runs for the bathroom.</p>
<p>She reappears a few minutes later. &ldquo;Coffee&rdquo; is all she says, then sits down and drinks mine.</p>
<p>I finish making breakfast and pour myself another cup. I sit down across from her. She steals a piece of my toast. &ldquo;I called Billy. He&rsquo;s not very happy with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he doesn&rsquo;t want to see you. I could run over there and pick up your stuff, if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; She grabs her purse from where she dropped it last night rummaging around in it. &ldquo;Got any cigarettes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shake my head, &ldquo;Gave them up when your mother left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you. I&rsquo;d kill for one.&rdquo; She gets up and heads out the door without so much as a &ldquo;see you later&rdquo; or &ldquo;look after Stephanie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still eating breakfast when Stephanie wanders in a while later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Branka?&rdquo; she mumbles, one small fist rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. She never could say Grampa when she was two and my nickname stuck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; I manage. I&rsquo;m not sure what to say to her. She just climbs into my lap and grabs a piece of my bacon &ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo; I ask?</p>
<p>She nods her head and eats what&rsquo;s left of my breakfast. When that&rsquo;s gone, I ask her &ldquo;More?&rdquo; and she nods again. I try to put her down as I get up, but she won&rsquo;t let go, wrapping her arms and legs around me. I had made enough food for the three of us, so I dish up the rest and pour her some milk, all one handed. After a couple of one-handed trips with food and the milk, we sit down with Steph in my lap again.</p>
<p>Steph eats like she&rsquo;s starving. She eats everything on the plate. I manage to get half a strip of bacon and some toast past her. When there&rsquo;s nothing left, she burps then giggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you watching us earlier,&rdquo; I finally say. &ldquo;Do you watch mama with men very often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nods. &ldquo;Sometimes I help, too.&rdquo; She claps her hand over her mouth then says &ldquo;Oops, I&rsquo;m not supposed to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God, I am conflicted, but my even darker side wins out. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I grab a napkin and change the subject. &ldquo;You made a bit of a mess, darling&rdquo; I say as I wipe her mouth. &ldquo;Uh-oh, I made a clean spot. I think you need a bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She makes a face, but doesn&rsquo;t complain when I carry her to the bathroom. I start the tap and let the water warm up while I undress her. Her clothes are as filthy as she is. &ldquo;When did you last take a bath, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; she says and shrugs her shoulders. She sits on the edge of the tub as I pull off her tiny t-shirt and jeans. She isn&rsquo;t even wearing any panties. I notice she had a bit of a rash between her legs. &ldquo;I need to pee,&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>Dagny hadn&rsquo;t flushed her vomit (and my semen?), so I do. Then I put the toilet seat down and Steph climbs up and pees. She doesn&rsquo;t bother to wipe herself until I hand her a wad of toilet paper. That explains the rash, I guess.</p>
<p>The water&rsquo;s warm now and she climbs into the tub. I close the drain and it starts to fill. She plays with an empty shampoo bottle. &ldquo;Sorry, darling, I don&rsquo;t have any better toys to play with.&rdquo; I turn her around and lean her back to put her hair under the tap. The water runs dirty out of her hair. Damn, no baby shampoo, either, so I grab my shampoo. I start a mental grocery list. I squirt some of my Pantene into her hair and start to lather it up. Actually, her hair is so dirty it wouldn&rsquo;t lather at all. She tilts her head back and smiles up at me as I wash her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owwie&rdquo; she says as I try to work out a few tangles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but your hair is very dirty. Here, lean back again.&rdquo; She holds her hair under the tap and more dirt flows out. I add more shampoo and get a little lather this time. It takes three &ldquo;Lather, Rinse, Repeat&quot;s to get her hair something like clean. I drain the filthy water and refill the tub. Then I start on the rest of her.</p>
<p>I have to use a washcloth on her to scrub off all the grime. I remember the one time I was over at Dagny&rsquo;s during bath time, she just dropped Steph in an inch of tepid water and let her play. She didn&rsquo;t even use soap. It&rsquo;s amazing the poor child survived this long.</p>
<p>When I start to wash between her legs, she starts to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owwie, Branka, that hurts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry, darling.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t want to hurt her, but she is awfully red down there. I guess I just have to use my hand. I soap up my hand and gently start to wash her red thighs and crotch. She lays back and spreads her legs wide. The rash is all over and I wash her as gently as I can. She lifts her little ass as I wash down between her crack and her little asshole. She starts to moan a bit. &ldquo;Does that hurt, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Branka, that feels good.&rdquo; She reaches down and spreads her little lips and says &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget inside, Billy says that&rsquo;s the most important part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What? Billy? What has that bastard been doing? I slide my fingers up and down her slit and I swear her little clit is hard. I notice she didn&rsquo;t seem to have a hymen as my finger slips easily inside her. She lets out another groan. Her little cunt is warm and wet. I can&rsquo;t believe my little four-year-old granddaughter isn&rsquo;t a virgin. I don&rsquo;t dare do anything more and I rinse her clean. She looks a little disappointed as I lift her out of the tub.</p>
<p>I dry her in my softest towel, then her hair. I brush her hair out as best I can, getting quite a few more &ldquo;owwies&rdquo; in the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steph, honey, you have an awful rash between your legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mommy said it&rsquo;s OK&rdquo; she replies.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me some lotion on it&rdquo; and I grab some hand lotion and start to smear it on.</p>
<p>She jumps a bit and giggles &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cold, Branka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, darling.&rdquo; I add some better skin cream to my mental shopping list. I&rsquo;ll have to ask what to get, I&rsquo;m sure Dagny wouldn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>As my hand smoothes the lotion around, she moaned &ldquo;that feels good.&rdquo; She squirms and holds my hand against her little cunt and smiles. I quickly pull my hand away and she frowns. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Branka?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I mutter.</p>
<p>I realize that I don&rsquo;t have any other clothes for her. I&rsquo;ll have to stop by Billy&rsquo;s and get her stuff this afternoon. I hope Dagny gets back soon so she can watch her.</p>
<p>I wrap her in the towel and carry her into my room. I dig out one of her grandmother&rsquo;s old t-shirts and put it on her. She&rsquo;s smothered in it, but it&rsquo;s all I have. &ldquo;Here, hop up into bed and I&rsquo;ll wash your old clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I throw her little pile of clothes in the washer and add extra soap. When I get back to my bedroom, I can&rsquo;t believe what I see.</p>
<p>Little Stephanie is playing with herself down there. She&rsquo;s kicked off the comforter and pulled up the t-shirt. Her eyes are closed and moans as one little hand plays with her clit and the other slides in and out of her tiny cunt. I stand frozen in the doorway, then back out slowly and closing the door. I sit down in my office and try to think. What has this little girl been doing? What has her mother been doing? Should I report this??? My mind is spinning.</p>
