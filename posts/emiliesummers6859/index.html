  "articleBody": "The Sale As soon as Amanda got off from the school bus, she skipped merrily towards her home. The 11 year old girl couldn’t wait to meet her parents for she was well loved. They weren’t a very well-to-do family, however for she couldn’t have everything her little heart desired. Still, it didn’t bother the child because she understood the predicaments of her parents. She was obedient, intelligent, and was blessed with ravishing beauty- a real image of an angel. Her shiny golden blonde hair flows just below her shoulders delicately curved at its tips. Her eyes were blue like limpid pools and her eyelashes were long and curled. Her mouth was perfectly shaped and her face was free from blemishes. Her body was just staring to blossom and her curves were just starting to show. Her cute budding breasts were also beginning to develop most lusciously.\nOpening the door, she sensed something was wrong. Her parent weren’t there to greet her. “They must be busy,” she though, so she put down her bag and tried to find them. She didn’t bother to change from her school uniform of a white frilled blouse accented by a cute blue tie, a blue pleated skirt just below her knees, white socks, and strap-on black shoes- to her pjs- for she was a bit worried of any unsightly event that might have happened to her father and mother.\nAs she passed through her father’s study, she heard voices… two of them she recognized to be that of her parents’, but the other two, she didn’t know. She stole a peep at a crack in the door as she saw her mother crying bitterly, and her father comforting her, wearing a worried look. Amanda wanted to barge in but she knew she ought not meddle in affairs that do not concern her. The other two men in the room were smirking. One of them was rather large and overweight, the other was fit and tall, quite handsome too… Amanda thought.\n“Mr. Summers, I’m afraid I would have to call the police because your debt to my boss is already long overdue,” the large man said. “No, please… give me another week… I’ll pay you everything in full,” her father pleaded. The large man turned to the tall handsome man apparently his boss who was smoking a pipe, he shook his head once without saying a word. The large man turned back to her parents exclaiming, “No can do. Pay now or go to jail!” He grabbed a cellular phone from his back pocket and started dialing and while Mrs. Summers fell down on her knees and begged for mercy, he pushed her away roughly sending her flying across the corner of the room. Mr. Summers was too horrified to do anything, he seemed glued to where he was standing.\nAt this point, Amanda could hold back no more, she barged into the room, knelt before her mother crying. The two men became distracted and were astonished as the little girl suddenly entered.\nThe tall handsome man signaled the large man to stop dialing as he watched amusedly at the little girl. “Please sir, have mercy, I beg of you…” cried Amanda. The tall man smiled as he motioned her father to approach him whispering something into his ear. Her father had a bewildered expression and he refused the man’s offer at first, but his weak personality finally gave in as threats were furled at him by the large man. He was then made to sign a contract to which Amanda had no idea what it purports to be.\nUpon quick orders of the tall man, the large man went outside and returned a few moments later with a medium-sized black leather bag. The tall man opened it and smiled.\nThe large man then grabbed her parents’ arms leading them away from the study. Amanda followed but the tall man grabbed her wrist tightly. As soon as they were gone, the tall man spoke for the first time.\n“Child, what is your name?”\n“A…Amanda Summers, s..sir,” she stuttered.\nThe tall man smiled as he stroke her hair. “How old are you?”\n“I’m eleven years old, sir…”\nHe nodded and at the same time taking a pair of shiny silver handcuffs and slipped them on her wrists in front of her. The little girl tried to squirm free but was interrupted by the stern voice of the man.\n“Don’t fight me, Amanda, you are my property now. Your father owed me a lot of money and he had just consented to sell you to me in settlement of his obligations, else both your parents go to jail.” He took out the contract and held it out for Amanda to read. She sobbed and her head was downcast. The tall man cupped her chin making her look at him straight in the eyes. “You are very beautiful, Amanda, and a very dutiful daughter as well. You will make a very fine slave where I’ll be taking you.” Amanda shudders at the thought. “You’ll obey my biddings, won’t you, my little slave?”\nThe girl nodded obediently as tears stream down from her cheeks. The man smiled, putting his arms around her.\n“You are not to scream, my little angel, else I will be compelled to gag you.” He held out a large ball gag for her to see. She gave a whimper upon seeing the size of the thing.\nThe tall man swiftly took out a collar attaching it to her neck. He quickly attaches a chain on her ankles, only allowing her to barely walk. Then, he took a chain attaching it to her collar, smiled and whispered, “It’s time to go to your Master’s abode. You may never see your house, nor your parents again.” Amanda started to cry as the tall man yanked on the chain and lead her outside the study.\nAs soon as she stepped out of the room, she saw her parents’ forlorn faces guarded by the large man. Her mother ran to her, “My baby…oh..oh…Amanda….” The girl cried as she bade goodbye to her parents. The tall man then commanded the large man to take the girl to his van. He then approached the frightened couple and quickly injected some drug in their heads which would make them forget the traumatic events that happened that day. Both fell down in a moment to the floor as they sunk off to a deep sleep.\nThe tall man quickly entered the van where Amanda was already blindfolded at the back of the van. The tall man glanced at his newly bought slave and he grinned, thinking of the sadistic things he would do to the helpless child.\nThe Initiation After a while, the van’s engine stopped running. Still blindfolded, cuffed, and chained, she felt she was carried off the van by the large man. He cradled her in his strong arms and the child dared not move nor make a sound for fear of stirring up the anger of her new owner.\n“Bring her up to my personal chamber in 30 minutes, Boris.” she heard the tall man say to the large man.\n“Yes, my lord.” the large man answered. He opened a door, brining the child with him inside, sat her on a chair whilst her remove her blindfold. The grief-strickened girl looked at Boris with fear in her eyes.\n“I….I’m s…scared….” gasped Amanda. Boris abruptly lapped her ass, warning her, “Silence! You are not allowed to speak, child. For in this domain, your master reigns supreme. You are nothing!”\nAmanda cringed as she heard those words, her head was downcast. Boris cupped her chin and said in his hoarse voice, “You are to obey your master at all costs. Do everything he wishes, and he will not harm you. Disobey, and you will be punished severely. Every time you do something that displeases the master, he may discipline you himself, or he may bring you to me. Remember that you are now a slave, a sex-slave in fact, and slaves don’t have rights. Don’t even think of escaping, because you can’t. The master has dozens of servants who would make sure that you wouldn’t be able to go anywhere. Do you understand me, Amanda?”\n“Y…yes s…sir” stammered the poor child.\n“What is your responsibility now that you’re a slave?”\n“I…I am to…to obey my master….at all…costs…”\n“Excellent. Now, it is time to go to your master.” Boris said. He yanked the chain motioning for her to follow him. He led the child to the chamber where the master was staying. They passed through a spacious hallway filled with rooms. It was a mansion like Amanda had never seen before.\nAfter a while, Boris opened two huge doors, and Amanda was stunned to see the size and grandeur of the room.\n“Here she is, my lord” Boris addressed to the master.\n“Very good, Boris, please leave us now.” The tall man replied and Boris left.\n“Amanda.” echoed the tall man.\nThe child stood alert as the tall man spoke her name.\n“Come.”\nAmanda walked slowly and painfully towards her master dragging the chains which clanked on the ground. As she stand before her master, he stood up and caressed her face.\n“What is your new role?”\n“I…I…am now…your s…slave…your sex…slave, master.”\n“And what is your responsibility?”\n“I…It is to obey…you at all…costs.”\nHe smiled. “Good. Boris must have taught you well.” He took the cuff keys and freed Amanda’s hands. Then, his hands roamed to her white school blouse, he started unbuttoning it revealing her white training bra.\n“You have a potential, this I can see.” said her master as his fingers outline the shape of her bra. Amanda dared not fight or struggle, she stood perfectly still as her master unhooked her bra revealing her young perky breasts.\n“Just the perfect size.” he said as he gently pinch on her nipples. He then attached the cuffs back on her wrists in front of her. Next he took a pair of scissors and cut off her panties. Her skirt was then slipped off next, then her socks were removed, as well as her shoes. Before long, she stood naked and trembling before her master.\n“Kneel, my child”\nThe girl promptly knelt down before him as he nodded in approval.\n“You proved yourself to be a very obedient child, Amanda, and I am pleased. Now listen, Take note that I am a dominant, so even though you didn’t do anything wrong, I may whip you as I please, torture you as I desire, because I am your master. I may even sell you to another master when I tire of you, because you are my property. The sex-slave I had before you was just sold in the slave market because she was not obedient enough for me. Poor thing, I just heard that she was brought to a place where women are constantly beaten and tortured even in public, making her be in a situation worse than she had while she was still under my supremacy. So you’d better think twice before making me mad for there are umpteen more places worse this, worse than you could ever imagine. Now, I am going to attach clamps on your nipples. You may cry, but you are not to scream. If you do, I will send you to Boris to be whipped, and I’m sure you don’t want that. Is that clear?”\n“Y…yes, master.”\nHe took a pair of alligator clamps and attached it first on her left nipple, then on her right. Amanda gave a little squeal which - fortunately - was manageable enough for her master.\nWith the nipple clamps put on, Amanda couldn’t help but cry. Her master looked at her in the eyes then motioned her to stand up.\n“I know that it is quite easy for you to remove your nipple clamps with your hands tied in front of you. But I’d advise you against it. Disobedience will lead to punishment, and you know it.”\nHe pressed a buzzer and in a moment, a young maiden entered into the chamber.\n“Take this child and prepare her according to my likings for I will be training her as soon as she’s ready and presentable before me.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\nWith that, the master tossed the chain to the maiden who led the child out of the chamber to be prepare for her training.\nGetting Ready Amanda followed in silence as the maiden lead her through the hall. The walls were laden with pictures of little girls as young as six brutally tortured. There was indeed no doubt that her Master is truly a saddist and a pedophile. She shuddered in fright at the thought of being tortured like the previous slave girls of her master. Soft cries were heard. The maiden turned around and asked,\n“Are you all right, Amanda?”\nAmanda sniffled. “Yes… I mean no… I’m scared… Are you master’s slave too? What’s… your name?”\n“I’m Keisha, I’m fifteen, and yes, I am his slave. I was brought here through the Master’s orders when I was only eight. He used me day and night unfailingly. I assume that you must have met Sir Boris?” Amanda nods. “I must tell you that Sir Boris’s warning of not to disobey the master must not to be ignored. Master can really be vicious and cruel so you do not want to get on his bad side. He never forgives.”\n“W..What happened to the girls who disobeyed him?”\nKeisha shook her head sadly. “They were spirited away to barbarous places a thousand times much worse than this. Some of them are even thought to be killed by murderers. Don’t even think of escaping because it’s just impossible.”\nAmanda nods and said no more. After what seems like an eternity of walking through the vast halls, they stopped at a door and Keisha led her in. “I must get you ready for the Master at once. We must put our conversation to a halt. Wait here, I have to get some things and I’ll be with you shortly.”\nWith that, Keisha disappeared to another chamber within the room. Amanda stands there looking at the big empty room. After a moment, Keisha arrived, bringing with her several items: a see-through nightie, a brush, a hair bow, make-up, perfumed oils, a collar, and dainty chains.\n“Please keep still Amanda, I have to make you presentable to the Master or else I’ll get severely punished…” Keisha whispered. First, she gently removed the alligator clamps off Amanda’s nipples which made her yelp. “Don’t cry Amanda, I’ll make it feel all better,” Keisha said and she took an amount of perfumed oil and rubbed it across her sore nipples. “Feel better now?” Keisha inquired. “Yes, it doesn’t sting as much as before,” Amanda replied. Keisha then rubs some more oil around her tiny breasts and all over her body. All the while, Amanda spoke not a word.\nNext, Keisha brushed through her silky golden blonde hair and tied it up in a high ponytail with the pink hair bow. She turns her around and applies light make-up on her delicate face.\n“Perfect,” Keisha said. She then slipped the cuffs off her wrists, and puts the sheer nightie over her nude body. She removed the old collar on her neck and replaced it with a golden one which was more like a choker. Then, she attaches the chains on her wrists and ankles.\n“I have to attach these clamps back on Amanda… I’m really sorry… I don’t want to do it but the Master wishes that it be done his way… I hope you understand…” Keisha said. “Yes. I understand… Keisha…” Amanda said. She winced as she felt the clamps secure her perky nipples once again.\n“You are now ready to be presented to the Master. Please be courteous and when you’re standing before him, kneel down always, head bent.”\n“Yes Keisha, I’ll do as you say,” Amanda sighed sadly.\n",

<p>As soon as Amanda got off from the school bus, she skipped merrily towards her home. The 11 year old girl couldn&rsquo;t wait to meet her parents for she was well loved. They weren&rsquo;t a very well-to-do family, however for she couldn&rsquo;t have everything her little heart desired. Still, it didn&rsquo;t bother the child because she understood the predicaments of her parents. She was obedient, intelligent, and was blessed with ravishing beauty- a real image of an angel. Her shiny golden blonde hair flows just below her shoulders delicately curved at its tips. Her eyes were blue like limpid pools and her eyelashes were long and curled. Her mouth was perfectly shaped and her face was free from blemishes. Her body was just staring to blossom and her curves were just starting to show. Her cute budding breasts were also beginning to develop most lusciously.</p>
<p>Opening the door, she sensed something was wrong. Her parent weren&rsquo;t there to greet her. &ldquo;They must be busy,&rdquo; she though, so she put down her bag and tried to find them. She didn&rsquo;t bother to change from her school uniform of a white frilled blouse accented by a cute blue tie, a blue pleated skirt just below her knees, white socks, and strap-on black shoes- to her pjs- for she was a bit worried of any unsightly event that might have happened to her father and mother.</p>
<p>As she passed through her father&rsquo;s study, she heard voices&hellip; two of them she recognized to be that of her parents&rsquo;, but the other two, she didn&rsquo;t know. She stole a peep at a crack in the door as she saw her mother crying bitterly, and her father comforting her, wearing a worried look. Amanda wanted to barge in but she knew she ought not meddle in affairs that do not concern her. The other two men in the room were smirking. One of them was rather large and overweight, the other was fit and tall, quite handsome too&hellip; Amanda thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Summers, I&rsquo;m afraid I would have to call the police because your debt to my boss is already long overdue,&rdquo; the large man said. &ldquo;No, please&hellip; give me another week&hellip; I&rsquo;ll pay you everything in full,&rdquo; her father pleaded. The large man turned to the tall handsome man apparently his boss who was smoking a pipe, he shook his head once without saying a word. The large man turned back to her parents exclaiming, &ldquo;No can do. Pay now or go to jail!&rdquo; He grabbed a cellular phone from his back pocket and started dialing and while Mrs. Summers fell down on her knees and begged for mercy, he pushed her away roughly sending her flying across the corner of the room. Mr. Summers was too horrified to do anything, he seemed glued to where he was standing.</p>
<p>At this point, Amanda could hold back no more, she barged into the room, knelt before her mother crying. The two men became distracted and were astonished as the little girl suddenly entered.</p>
<p>The tall handsome man signaled the large man to stop dialing as he watched amusedly at the little girl. &ldquo;Please sir, have mercy, I beg of you&hellip;&rdquo; cried Amanda. The tall man smiled as he motioned her father to approach him whispering something into his ear. Her father had a bewildered expression and he refused the man&rsquo;s offer at first, but his weak personality finally gave in as threats were furled at him by the large man. He was then made to sign a contract to which Amanda had no idea what it purports to be.</p>
<p>Upon quick orders of the tall man, the large man went outside and returned a few moments later with a medium-sized black leather bag. The tall man opened it and smiled.</p>
<p>The large man then grabbed her parents&rsquo; arms leading them away from the study. Amanda followed but the tall man grabbed her wrist tightly. As soon as they were gone, the tall man spoke for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&hellip;Amanda Summers, s..sir,&rdquo; she stuttered.</p>
<p>The tall man smiled as he stroke her hair. &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m eleven years old, sir&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded and at the same time taking a pair of shiny silver handcuffs and slipped them on her wrists in front of her. The little girl tried to squirm free but was interrupted by the stern voice of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fight me, Amanda, you are my property now. Your father owed me a lot of money and he had just consented to sell you to me in settlement of his obligations, else both your parents go to jail.&rdquo; He took out the contract and held it out for Amanda to read. She sobbed and her head was downcast. The tall man cupped her chin making her look at him straight in the eyes. &ldquo;You are very beautiful, Amanda, and a very dutiful daughter as well. You will make a very fine slave where I&rsquo;ll be taking you.&rdquo; Amanda shudders at the thought. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll obey my biddings, won&rsquo;t you, my little slave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded obediently as tears stream down from her cheeks. The man smiled, putting his arms around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not to scream, my little angel, else I will be compelled to gag you.&rdquo; He held out a large ball gag for her to see. She gave a whimper upon seeing the size of the thing.</p>
<p>The tall man swiftly took out a collar attaching it to her neck. He quickly attaches a chain on her ankles, only allowing her to barely walk. Then, he took a chain attaching it to her collar, smiled and whispered, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to go to your Master&rsquo;s abode. You may never see your house, nor your parents again.&rdquo; Amanda started to cry as the tall man yanked on the chain and lead her outside the study.</p>
<p>As soon as she stepped out of the room, she saw her parents&rsquo; forlorn faces guarded by the large man. Her mother ran to her, &ldquo;My baby&hellip;oh..oh&hellip;Amanda&hellip;.&rdquo; The girl cried as she bade goodbye to her parents. The tall man then commanded the large man to take the girl to his van. He then approached the frightened couple and quickly injected some drug in their heads which would make them forget the traumatic events that happened that day. Both fell down in a moment to the floor as they sunk off to a deep sleep.</p>
<p>The tall man quickly entered the van where Amanda was already blindfolded at the back of the van. The tall man glanced at his newly bought slave and he grinned, thinking of the sadistic things he would do to the helpless child.</p>
<h5 id="the-initiation">The Initiation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-initiation">#</a></h5>
<p>After a while, the van&rsquo;s engine stopped running. Still blindfolded, cuffed, and chained, she felt she was carried off the van by the large man. He cradled her in his strong arms and the child dared not move nor make a sound for fear of stirring up the anger of her new owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her up to my personal chamber in 30 minutes, Boris.&rdquo; she heard the tall man say to the large man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo; the large man answered. He opened a door, brining the child with him inside, sat her on a chair whilst her remove her blindfold. The grief-strickened girl looked at Boris with fear in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;.I&rsquo;m s&hellip;scared&hellip;.&rdquo; gasped Amanda. Boris abruptly lapped her ass, warning her, &ldquo;Silence! You are not allowed to speak, child. For in this domain, your master reigns supreme. You are nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda cringed as she heard those words, her head was downcast. Boris cupped her chin and said in his hoarse voice, &ldquo;You are to obey your master at all costs. Do everything he wishes, and he will not harm you. Disobey, and you will be punished severely. Every time you do something that displeases the master, he may discipline you himself, or he may bring you to me. Remember that you are now a slave, a sex-slave in fact, and slaves don&rsquo;t have rights. Don&rsquo;t even think of escaping, because you can&rsquo;t. The master has dozens of servants who would make sure that you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to go anywhere. Do you understand me, Amanda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&hellip;yes s&hellip;sir&rdquo; stammered the poor child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your responsibility now that you&rsquo;re a slave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I am to&hellip;to obey my master&hellip;.at all&hellip;costs&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent. Now, it is time to go to your master.&rdquo; Boris said. He yanked the chain motioning for her to follow him. He led the child to the chamber where the master was staying. They passed through a spacious hallway filled with rooms. It was a mansion like Amanda had never seen before.</p>
<p>After a while, Boris opened two huge doors, and Amanda was stunned to see the size and grandeur of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she is, my lord&rdquo; Boris addressed to the master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Boris, please leave us now.&rdquo; The tall man replied and Boris left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amanda.&rdquo; echoed the tall man.</p>
<p>The child stood alert as the tall man spoke her name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda walked slowly and painfully towards her master dragging the chains which clanked on the ground. As she stand before her master, he stood up and caressed her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your new role?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;am now&hellip;your s&hellip;slave&hellip;your sex&hellip;slave, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is your responsibility?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;It is to obey&hellip;you at all&hellip;costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled. &ldquo;Good. Boris must have taught you well.&rdquo; He took the cuff keys and freed Amanda&rsquo;s hands. Then, his hands roamed to her white school blouse, he started unbuttoning it revealing her white training bra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a potential, this I can see.&rdquo; said her master as his fingers outline the shape of her bra. Amanda dared not fight or struggle, she stood perfectly still as her master unhooked her bra revealing her young perky breasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the perfect size.&rdquo; he said as he gently pinch on her nipples. He then attached the cuffs back on her wrists in front of her. Next he took a pair of scissors and cut off her panties. Her skirt was then slipped off next, then her socks were removed, as well as her shoes. Before long, she stood naked and trembling before her master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kneel, my child&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl promptly knelt down before him as he nodded in approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You proved yourself to be a very obedient child, Amanda, and I am pleased. Now listen, Take note that I am a dominant, so even though you didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, I may whip you as I please, torture you as I desire, because I am your master. I may even sell you to another master when I tire of you, because you are my property. The sex-slave I had before you was just sold in the slave market because she was not obedient enough for me. Poor thing, I just heard that she was brought to a place where women are constantly beaten and tortured even in public, making her be in a situation worse than she had while she was still under my supremacy. So you&rsquo;d better think twice before making me mad for there are umpteen more places worse this, worse than you could ever imagine. Now, I am going to attach clamps on your nipples. You may cry, but you are not to scream. If you do, I will send you to Boris to be whipped, and I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t want that. Is that clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&hellip;yes, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a pair of alligator clamps and attached it first on her left nipple, then on her right. Amanda gave a little squeal which - fortunately - was manageable enough for her master.</p>
<p>With the nipple clamps put on, Amanda couldn&rsquo;t help but cry. Her master looked at her in the eyes then motioned her to stand up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that it is quite easy for you to remove your nipple clamps with your hands tied in front of you. But I&rsquo;d advise you against it. Disobedience will lead to punishment, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pressed a buzzer and in a moment, a young maiden entered into the chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this child and prepare her according to my likings for I will be training her as soon as she&rsquo;s ready and presentable before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, the master tossed the chain to the maiden who led the child out of the chamber to be prepare for her training.</p>
<h5 id="getting-ready">Getting Ready<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#getting-ready">#</a></h5>
<p>Amanda followed in silence as the maiden lead her through the hall. The walls were laden with pictures of little girls as young as six brutally tortured. There was indeed no doubt that her Master is truly a saddist and a pedophile. She shuddered in fright at the thought of being tortured like the previous slave girls of her master. Soft cries were heard. The maiden turned around and asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Amanda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda sniffled. &ldquo;Yes&hellip; I mean no&hellip; I&rsquo;m scared&hellip; Are you master&rsquo;s slave too? What&rsquo;s&hellip; your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Keisha, I&rsquo;m fifteen, and yes, I am his slave. I was brought here through the Master&rsquo;s orders when I was only eight. He used me day and night unfailingly. I assume that you must have met Sir Boris?&rdquo; Amanda nods. &ldquo;I must tell you that Sir Boris&rsquo;s warning of not to disobey the master must not to be ignored. Master can really be vicious and cruel so you do not want to get on his bad side. He never forgives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W..What happened to the girls who disobeyed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keisha shook her head sadly. &ldquo;They were spirited away to barbarous places a thousand times much worse than this. Some of them are even thought to be killed by murderers. Don&rsquo;t even think of escaping because it&rsquo;s just impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda nods and said no more. After what seems like an eternity of walking through the vast halls, they stopped at a door and Keisha led her in. &ldquo;I must get you ready for the Master at once. We must put our conversation to a halt. Wait here, I have to get some things and I&rsquo;ll be with you shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, Keisha disappeared to another chamber within the room. Amanda stands there looking at the big empty room. After a moment, Keisha arrived, bringing with her several items: a see-through nightie, a brush, a hair bow, make-up, perfumed oils, a collar, and dainty chains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please keep still Amanda, I have to make you presentable to the Master or else I&rsquo;ll get severely punished&hellip;&rdquo; Keisha whispered. First, she gently removed the alligator clamps off Amanda&rsquo;s nipples which made her yelp. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry Amanda, I&rsquo;ll make it feel all better,&rdquo; Keisha said and she took an amount of perfumed oil and rubbed it across her sore nipples. &ldquo;Feel better now?&rdquo; Keisha inquired. &ldquo;Yes, it doesn&rsquo;t sting as much as before,&rdquo; Amanda replied. Keisha then rubs some more oil around her tiny breasts and all over her body. All the while, Amanda spoke not a word.</p>
<p>Next, Keisha brushed through her silky golden blonde hair and tied it up in a high ponytail with the pink hair bow. She turns her around and applies light make-up on her delicate face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; Keisha said. She then slipped the cuffs off her wrists, and puts the sheer nightie over her nude body. She removed the old collar on her neck and replaced it with a golden one which was more like a choker. Then, she attaches the chains on her wrists and ankles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to attach these clamps back on Amanda&hellip; I&rsquo;m really sorry&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to do it but the Master wishes that it be done his way&hellip; I hope you understand&hellip;&rdquo; Keisha said. &ldquo;Yes. I understand&hellip; Keisha&hellip;&rdquo; Amanda said. She winced as she felt the clamps secure her perky nipples once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are now ready to be presented to the Master. Please be courteous and when you&rsquo;re standing before him, kneel down always, head bent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Keisha, I&rsquo;ll do as you say,&rdquo; Amanda sighed sadly.</p>
