  "articleBody": "Michayla was born during the worst blizzard on record for Denver. She was two months pre mature, but I loved her the minute I saw her. Her parents and I had to leave her at the hospital for another seven weeks after she was born. When she came home I was allowed to feed her a bottle and bathe her. I was babysitting her, as her Mom, Dad and I shared an apartment when she was just one month old. One day I told her ‘one day your uncle is going to fuck your baby pussy.’ She just smiled as if she understood. As she grew she seemed rather attached to me and we bonded as if I was her Dad. She would run up to me and hug my neck and smile. When she was one I was giving her a bath and again I promised her I was going to fuck her pussy. She just cooed and smiled.\nAge Two\nShe is walking and talking now so I keep my thoughts to myself not without difficulty. She keeps coming to me hugging my neck and smiling. I still change her diapers every so often and she smiles up at me. By now she is almost completely potty trained. Her mother moves away to Texas and I don’t get to see her that much, but I keep in touch.\nAge Six\nMy day starts out normally and I had just sent Michayla her birthday card. Later that night I got a sickening phone call.\n“Mr. Jones this is William Johnson with the Dallas Police Department, I am calling to inform you that your sister and her husband have been killed in a car accident. We do have your niece Michayla, she is ok but visibly shaken, can you come and take responsibility for her sir?”\nOf course I was very upset and struck dumb for a few seconds until I replied.\n“I will be there as soon as possible tomorrow.”\nThey had found my name in my sister’s cell phone and Michayla had told them I was her uncle.\nI managed to book a flight that night for the first flight out and the last flight returning that day. I arrived at the police department and Michayla ran to me smiling putting her arms around my neck and hugging tight. She looked so sweet and vulnerable in her cut off top with the thin straps and her tiny raged blue denim shorts.\n“Are you OK honey? Uncle Ted is going to look after you now.”\n“She is in a bit of a daze but other than that she will be fine.” said the female police officer as the child didn’t answer apart from some sobs.\nShe was visibly shaken with the loss of her parents and cried on my shoulder. I reassured her that she will be fine and that I was taking her home with me; again, she just smiled between sobs. There was a lot of paperwork to complete.\nFinally back home I showed her to her room. It wasn’t decorated with stuffed animals and all the typical girl’s room as yet but it soon would be and anyway she had brought quite a case full of soft toys plus another case of clothing. I would return in the future to sort out the house, being the only relative. She seemed settled after a drink and some cookies, then I told her it was time for a bath. I checked in on her while she was bathing and she was playing in the bubbles. Wow! what a sight, glistening wet bubbles caught on the nubs of her tender little nipples.\n“Do you need any help honey?”\n“Yes,” was the simple reply.\nI started by washing her hair, and then I soaped up the wash cloth and washed her little body, managing to hold back on exploring her tiny private parts, but in high excitement for the future. She was so cute I kept smiling at her happiness and inwardly, my good fortune, getting dimpled smiles back.\n“Another five minutes play and splash OK,” I told her getting a happy nod and grin.\nOn my return I helped her out of the tub to dry her little body. I helped pull her panties on and put her little night gown on, then we trotted across to her room to brush her hair. It was so soft and full when brushed.\nFinally it was bed time and I tucked her in and kissed her good night, not offering a story because I am hopeless at reading. I caught up with some sport on TV and started getting ready for bed thinking it had been an extremely long day for me as well. Before turning my light out, I started making a mental check list of things I have to do, enrol her in school, get her some new clothes and put her on my insurance policy at work and find someone to watch her from 3pm until I get home at 4.30pm.\nAs usual it doesn’t take long for me to drift off to sleep. About an hour later Michayla screamed, waking me, instantly rushing to her room to see what is wrong. She tells me she just had a nightmare and then she asks if she can sleep in my bed with me tonight. What could I say to the poor little orphan. I just looked at her and agreed. She hugged my neck gratefully.\n“I love you,” she murmured which I answered in the same way.\nThe next morning I took her to the school and enrolled her in Kindergarten, filling out all of the paperwork to enable her to start school the next day. We had a great day, showing her the local sights, play parks and beaches. That evening I again told her to get ready to take a bath, filling the tub with water at just the right temperature and then I poured in the bubbles. Michayla got in and we repeated the performance as when she arrived, thinking regularity would be a help in our bonding and her settling.\nAs I am brushing her hair she started crying.\n“Hey What’s wrong hon?”\n“I want Mom and Dad,” came her weeping reply.\n“You will see them again in heaven,” I reassured her.\nShe smiled and hugged me.\n“I love you Uncle Ted.”\n“I love you too.”\nAgain the same thing happens, with her screams and request to sleep in my bed with me. I let her. This time she snuggled really close to me. I just held her in my arms, but still managing not to touch her. In the morning I woke up with a piss hard on, sneaking out of the bed and go to the bathroom, she was sound asleep and looking so angelic. I had to wake her up and start dressing her for school and feed her oatmeal for breakfast. When she got on the school bus I could see a tear in her eye, but like a little trooper, she turned and waved goodbye,\nThat evening when she got home I give Michayla the card I had mailed to her as it had been returned. She opened it and read it and then she ran towards me and hugged my neck and smiled. I smiled back and she kissed me right on the lips, it was a little girl sloppy kiss but a kiss none the less.\n“What do you want for your birthday,” I asked.\n“Remember when you would tell me that you were going to fuck my baby puss when I was smaller?”\n“Yes,” I replied blushing, shocked and slightly embarrassed and wondering what next.\n“I want that for my birthday,” she giggled.\n“But you are way too young honey.”\n“If Katie in school can do it so can I,” she reasoned with typical child logic.\n“OK, not tonight but maybe tomorrow as it’ll be Friday and you don’t have to go to school or me to work and we need to think about it and chat.”\nShe agreed, but I could see her pent up excitement, probably on a par with mine.\nThe next day at work I am somewhat distracted, but managed to muddle through the day. I arrived home early to await my precious Michayla, for I knew on this night she was going to give me her virginity. I was nervous and in a blind sweat with anticipation. The minutes seemed like hours and hours like days, until finally the bus arrived.\nShe came running into the house and threw her back pack onto the floor, her coat following, starting to take off her clothes. Where I got the willpower from I don’t know.\n“Wait one minute young lady.”\n“But Uncle Ted, you told me you were going to fuck my baby puss,” she pouted.\n“I am - but first we are going out to dinner because we need to talk about all this, then we are coming home and if everything is OK, we will.”\nShe smiled and ran towards me and hugged me. I returned the sincere embrace and kissed her on her cheek. We went to The Golden Coral, getting a lone corner booth and we stuff ourselves but I explained a lot about feelings, love and also how her body and mine are very different. I looked at Michayla when I felt all had been said.\n“Are you ready to go?”\nThe beaming smile was an answer.\nArriving back home we headed in some of a rush for the bedroom. Michayla had anticipated this night but I was shocked to see that she wore no panties under her sweats that day or no tee shirt under her sweat shirt. I asked her if was she in a hurry when she dressed this morning and she just smiled.\nIn front of her, without any adverse reactions and I wondered if she had seen her deceased dad do the same, I got undressed and laid in the bed beside her cute naked body, asking her again if she was sure she wanted to do this. The slightly nervous nod and flushed face were positive signs.\nI kissed her on her cherubic lips and put my tongue in her little mouth. She tried to kiss me passionately like she had seen in the movies and she had obviously studied the actions closely. I then kissed her on her neck, then her ear, and I stopped at her tiny nipple. I licked her nipple and it stood up like an tiny pink eraser. Continuing kissing my way south, I reached her virgin slit and started licking her pussy. She didn’t object or say it was gross to lick her pee hole as I was half expecting, although I had explained the oral side of sex over our burgers. She just moaned and it is no long before I am hard as a rock.\nMichayla starts pushing her pussy into my mouth.\n“OH, OH GOD that feels so good, she gasped.\nI continued licking her until she came which was very quick, a lot of quivering through her body, some tensing and nipping my skin and a lot of noise. I let her lay back down basking in the afterglow of having her first ever orgasm, until I levered up to kiss her on her lips letting her taste herself for the first time. Again, no objection, in fact she seemed to savour the taste, which was so sweet. I reminded that what we were about to do next will hurt at first but will get better.\n“I understand, you told me before Uncle Ted,” she answered, almost impatiently.\nI laid on top of her and told her to guide my cock to her cuuny entrance which she does easily. This child is a fucking star I mused. I could feel the head of my cock start to penetrate and then I encountered her maidenhood. Pulling out a little and then thrusting forward I ripped through her hymen.\nShit! Did Michayla scream out as I penetrated fully in one shove?\n“OK?” getting just smiles and nods.\nI waited for her to relax, murmuring assurances and then I started a slow fucking motion, picking up the pace as she became more accustomed to my cock in her tight preteen pussy. She started moaning. I was working my groin onto her clitty; my hairy bits against her silky smooth pudenda.\n“OH - OooH OH Goooooddd Uncle Teeedddd, that feels so good,” she screamed, her body humping up against me. “I am cumming again.”\nThis sent me over the edge and I shot my load into my niece’s no longer virgin pussy. Simmering down slowly after a long slow soak of my dwindling dick in her tiny snatch, we both lay in our afterglow of sex. I kissed Michayla on her lips.\n“Happy Birthday Michayla my love.”\n“I love you Uncle Ted.”\n“Can we do this again?”\n“Of course honey, any time.”\n“Tomorrow?”\nI know I can’t wait.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Michayla was born during the worst blizzard on record for Denver. She was two months pre mature, but I loved her the minute I saw her. Her parents and I had to leave her at the hospital for another seven weeks after she was born. When she came home I was allowed to feed her a bottle and bathe her.

<p>The next morning I took her to the school and enrolled her in Kindergarten, filling out all of the paperwork to enable her to start school the next day. We had a great day, showing her the local sights, play parks and beaches. That evening I again told her to get ready to take a bath, filling the tub with water at just the right temperature and then I poured in the bubbles. Michayla got in and we repeated the performance as when she arrived, thinking regularity would be a help in our bonding and her settling.</p>
<p>As I am brushing her hair she started crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey What&rsquo;s wrong hon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want Mom and Dad,&rdquo; came her weeping reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see them again in heaven,&rdquo; I reassured her.</p>
<p>She smiled and hugged me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you Uncle Ted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the same thing happens, with her screams and request to sleep in my bed with me. I let her. This time she snuggled really close to me. I just held her in my arms, but still managing not to touch her. In the morning I woke up with a piss hard on, sneaking out of the bed and go to the bathroom, she was sound asleep and looking so angelic. I had to wake her up and start dressing her for school and feed her oatmeal for breakfast. When she got on the school bus I could see a tear in her eye, but like a little trooper, she turned and waved goodbye,</p>
<p>That evening when she got home I give Michayla the card I had mailed to her as it had been returned. She opened it and read it and then she ran towards me and hugged my neck and smiled. I smiled back and she kissed me right on the lips, it was a little girl sloppy kiss but a kiss none the less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want for your birthday,&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember when you would tell me that you were going to fuck my baby puss when I was smaller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied blushing, shocked and slightly embarrassed and wondering what next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want that for my birthday,&rdquo; she giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are way too young honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Katie in school can do it so can I,&rdquo; she reasoned with typical child logic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, not tonight but maybe tomorrow as it&rsquo;ll be Friday and you don&rsquo;t have to go to school or me to work and we need to think about it and chat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She agreed, but I could see her pent up excitement, probably on a par with mine.</p>
<p>The next day at work I am somewhat distracted, but managed to muddle through the day. I arrived home early to await my precious Michayla, for I knew on this night she was going to give me her virginity. I was nervous and in a blind sweat with anticipation. The minutes seemed like hours and hours like days, until finally the bus arrived.</p>
<p>She came running into the house and threw her back pack onto the floor, her coat following, starting to take off her clothes. Where I got the willpower from I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait one minute young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Uncle Ted, you told me you were going to fuck my baby puss,&rdquo; she pouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am - but first we are going out to dinner because we need to talk about all this, then we are coming home and if everything is OK, we will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled and ran towards me and hugged me. I returned the sincere embrace and kissed her on her cheek. We went to The Golden Coral, getting a lone corner booth and we stuff ourselves but I explained a lot about feelings, love and also how her body and mine are very different. I looked at Michayla when I felt all had been said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beaming smile was an answer.</p>
<p>Arriving back home we headed in some of a rush for the bedroom. Michayla had anticipated this night but I was shocked to see that she wore no panties under her sweats that day or no tee shirt under her sweat shirt. I asked her if was she in a hurry when she dressed this morning and she just smiled.</p>
<p>In front of her, without any adverse reactions and I wondered if she had seen her deceased dad do the same, I got undressed and laid in the bed beside her cute naked body, asking her again if she was sure she wanted to do this. The slightly nervous nod and flushed face were positive signs.</p>
<p>I kissed her on her cherubic lips and put my tongue in her little mouth. She tried to kiss me passionately like she had seen in the movies and she had obviously studied the actions closely. I then kissed her on her neck, then her ear, and I stopped at her tiny nipple. I licked her nipple and it stood up like an tiny pink eraser. Continuing kissing my way south, I reached her virgin slit and started licking her pussy. She didn&rsquo;t object or say it was gross to lick her pee hole as I was half expecting, although I had explained the oral side of sex over our burgers. She just moaned and it is no long before I am hard as a rock.</p>
<p>Michayla starts pushing her pussy into my mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OH, OH GOD that feels so good, she gasped.</p>
<p>I continued licking her until she came which was very quick, a lot of quivering through her body, some tensing and nipping my skin and a lot of noise. I let her lay back down basking in the afterglow of having her first ever orgasm, until I levered up to kiss her on her lips letting her taste herself for the first time. Again, no objection, in fact she seemed to savour the taste, which was so sweet. I reminded that what we were about to do next will hurt at first but will get better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, you told me before Uncle Ted,&rdquo; she answered, almost impatiently.</p>
<p>I laid on top of her and told her to guide my cock to her cuuny entrance which she does easily. This child is a fucking star I mused. I could feel the head of my cock start to penetrate and then I encountered her maidenhood. Pulling out a little and then thrusting forward I ripped through her hymen.</p>
<p>Shit! Did Michayla scream out as I penetrated fully in one shove?</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK?&rdquo; getting just smiles and nods.</p>
<p>I waited for her to relax, murmuring assurances and then I started a slow fucking motion, picking up the pace as she became more accustomed to my cock in her tight preteen pussy. She started moaning. I was working my groin onto her clitty; my hairy bits against her silky smooth pudenda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OH - OooH OH Goooooddd Uncle Teeedddd, that feels so good,&rdquo; she screamed, her body humping up against me. &ldquo;I am cumming again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sent me over the edge and I shot my load into my niece&rsquo;s no longer virgin pussy. Simmering down slowly after a long slow soak of my dwindling dick in her tiny snatch, we both lay in our afterglow of sex. I kissed Michayla on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy Birthday Michayla my love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you Uncle Ted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we do this again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course honey, any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
