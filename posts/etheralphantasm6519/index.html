To manipulate reality and to trick their minds, even their hearts if I will it so. All to rid them of their virginity’s and fill their developing wombs of my seed. Here is how it all came to be.\nIn my youth I was an archeologist, and a closet pedophile. Nevertheless, I was part of a team fresh out of Brown, excavating ruins and sites from civilizations long gone. One in particular, less than 50 miles south from Bratislava, blew us away. The site we unearthed was evidently a ritual spot for the god Baphomet. The following morning, I ended up as the sole survivor. I still remember it’s devilish smile that night when my colleagues were massacred. Just when I thought I was next, the demon lord paused before me. He knew of my deep desire for budding young women. Baphomet then made a chuckle that I swore rumbled the very earth beneath me before it said,\n“Instead of sparing thee, the blood from this sacrifice will erase this mortal life, and I shall bequeath upon thee abilities to achieve what your heart and loins desire most. Take and enjoy the fruits of what no man has experienced in centuries.”\nWith that, it vanished, just before dawn broke the horizon. I stood there, alone, contemplating. I felt a certain itch from within, an urge. I suddenly understood. I needed no food or water. My only sustenance was taking girls and to ravish them. Other than having felt grateful for being spared, this urge compelled me to test my powers. I traveled east a short ways. I used the shadows of trees as portals to slip through with the greatest of ease. My delight from anxiousness peaked when I felt I had to stop at a park in Lucenec. I sat on a bench and observed the summer scenery along with the few people who passed through to enjoy it as well.\nHours pass, I sat, motionless. Just as dusk crept early thanks to the Carpathian mountains, I saw a lone girl to my surprise. My mouth salivated upon such a vision. Blond shoulder-length hair in a ponytail, soft sky blue eyes, delicate facial features. I practically drooled before I slipped into the shadows. I continued to examine her. The outfit seemed like she got out of school hours ago. White blouse with a navy blue dirndl dress, cut off mid-thigh. The girl’s legs were lithe but toned, like the rest of her body. I looked deeper, to her soul. She just turned 13, and still a virgin. I suddenly marked her as my first victim. I had to have her. In her hands were an open book and a pencil, jotting idly upon it. I concluded that she was observing and documenting some of the flora easily accessible from the park, likely for some school project.\nI tested my abilities, and found I could control some of the elements. I made the wind rustle a bit, even curved a breeze to hike the girl’s dress up some. I chuckled softly from the shadow realm before I watched her push her dress down quickly. The sky grew darker. I knew I had to make my move now before she had to hurry home. I took a chance and willed an aural composition of an animal-like growl from a shadow beside the blond. To my surprise along with the girl’s, she gasped and stepped away in response. I then formed a pair of glowing eyes from that same shadow. The blonde’s fear grew as she took a few more steps away from the glowing eyes. I silently stepped out of my shadow and stopped in her path. She bumped into me and exclaimed as I predicted. The teen’s book and pencil dropped from her hands before she quickly turned around.\n“Goodness me,” I said in a smoothed tone, “Are you alright my dear? You seem rather startled upon something.” The girl looked up and my gaze locked with hers, seemingly entranced for only a moment. While her eyes looked to me, I made the glowing eyes vanish just as easily as it came.\n“Yes sir, I–I saw something over there. Eyes,” she said, turning back to look again. “It..it was there. I heard a growl too, like a wild wolf.” Gone was her claim, her bewilderment forced a wicked smile from me.\n“Seems there’s nothing there now. Odd.” I assured her and observed with her, playing my part in the brief facade. I went to kneel and picked up her book and pencil. The girl looked to me once more and smiled a cute smile. I extended the items to her, “Dusk has passed. You should return home, miss…?”\n“Tanya. My name is Tanya, sir. And you?”\n“I am….” I paused, unintentionally. My instinct to use my human name is gone, instead, replaced with, “Baphomet.” Upon hearing my name, Tanya’s eyes widen, as if she knew. Suddenly a fire sparked within me, compelled me to strike. In a swift motion, I tossed her book and pencil aside and swiftly tackled her to the grass. The girl’s gasp of surprise along with her body pressed against mine fueled my arousal quickly. I used the shadows to bind her wrists to the ground. Tanya struggled rather well for her size and protested while my body moved between her legs.\n“Please sir,” she pleaded, “Let me go.” Though she knew as much as I how futile it was. My hands glided across Tanya’s petite body and felt her developing curves at the waist and hips.\n‘Most delightful,’ I thought. With barely any effort due to my powers, I ripped her dress and blouse open, leaving little left to hide. Her sobs and quiet pleas became music to my ears. My hands gripped her ankles while I began laying kisses upon her smooth skin, starting with her neck. I traced my lips down her chest, my mouth enveloped her right breast. Her gasp influenced me to suckle upon it, even a bit of nibbling. Somehow, my subtle touches and demon saliva became something of a magical catalyst to her raging hormones. Those subtleties convinced her acceptance and arousal of the situation.\nThis was certainly beyond amazing, and it was only the beginning. Her hips rose out of instinct, to meet mine. A quiet but sexy moan escaped the girl’s lips. I answered with my hand grip her panties, and pushed them aside. My mouth left her aroused nipple only to move on to something better. I slid down her body while her legs relaxed yet remained spread for me. The blonde’s virgin treasure was already emanating a soft heat of arousal, with moisture glistening her nether region. I felt her body shiver lightly in anticipation, before my tongue darted out and stroked her labia minora. Tanya’s moan signified she wanted more, as did I. I obliged the teen girl by sliding my tongue against her pussy. Using the powers of darkness, I felt my tongue extend a couple inches more. I heard her cry out and buck her hips in need. The tip of my tongue barely touched her hymen, I can tell how consumed she is within her desire. I controlled my stretched appendage to back away from her hymen, and curled upward to her sensitive g-spot. Tanya’s hips buck against my face once more in response while my mouth envelops her pussy. I suckled her sweet nectar while my tongue stroking her sensitive area forced her body to produce more. In practically no time, her moans increased in volume from the stimulation and inevitably to her first orgasm. Upon consuming the girls juices, I could tell lovely Tanya was fertile. My arousal peaked knowing this.\nMy mouth left her wet pussy with an audible slurp before I positioned myself for the point of no return. The girl looked up at me, nearly breathless already from the foreplay. The look in her glazed eyes could not deny the need from her body. I willed the shadow to release the bonds at her wrists. Instantly her small arms wrapped around my neck and her legs spread, knees bent and tucked back a bit. The tip of my rock-hard erection touched her moist lips. Tanya shivered. I gave her only seconds to prepare. My cock twitched, moistening the tip and sides against her entrance. I pushed. She held onto me, her breath hot against my face. I eased myself more into her until I felt it touch her hymen. My gaze locked with hers before I pressed hard in one swift stroke. The tip of my cock ripped through Tanya’s hymen and nestled right at her cervix.\nThe tearing of a girl’s virginity is most exquisite, nothing else like it. Her cry of pain against my ear brought a devilish smile to my face. I held her shuddering body to me while I remained motionless atop the preteen girl. Once her sobs subsided, my hips moved slowly at first. I filled her pussy with each thrust. Her hips soon gyrated to match my movements. At a slow pace we moved in synchronization at first, enjoying the devil’s dance of fucking my no longer virgin Tanya. Her moans of passion met my groans of desire perfectly. In time, the beautiful blond wanted more as did I, our rhythm accelerated. My arms move to grip her, using her lithe form as leverage to drive my cock deeper and faster into her body. The tip of my penis leaked a bit of pre-cum into her womb and her pussy squeezed it, hungry for more. I obliged the girl knowing our peaks grew closer. I tilt Tanya’s head back and pound my cock harder and faster into her squishy cunt. Her cries grew louder as my groans increased. The blonde’s little body held me for dear life, signaling the start of her orgasm. In one final thrust, I roar loudly and drove my cock as deep as it could go inside Tanya’s pussy. I came nearly a dozen powerful spurts of semen deep into her developed uterus. The screaming girl’s orgasm sucked my demon seed further into her fertile womb, drinking it in blissful greed. I felt her body spasm uncontrollably in my arms while I bred my beautiful teen victim, claiming her body as mine for my spawn as of this night.\nAfter our orgasms subsided, I felt her pass out. Her young senses could not take anymore, and understandably so. I got what I wanted, and more. I felt more powerful somehow, rejuvenated and renewed. I slipped my cock out of her freshly fucked pussy and stood up, watching the sleeping Tanya on the ground. I watched my demon seed mixed with her virginal blood slowly ooze out. With a laugh, I walked away and disappear into the shadows, long before dawn. I pondered where to find my next target. Another virgin to ruin. Another girl to breed. For myself. For Baphomet.\nTo Be Continued…\n",

I slid down her body while her legs relaxed yet remained spread for me. The blonde&rsquo;s virgin treasure was already emanating a soft heat of arousal, with moisture glistening her nether region. I felt her body shiver lightly in anticipation, before my tongue darted out and stroked her labia minora. Tanya&rsquo;s moan signified she wanted more, as did I. I obliged the teen girl by sliding my tongue against her pussy. Using the powers of darkness, I felt my tongue extend a couple inches more. I heard her cry out and buck her hips in need. The tip of my tongue barely touched her hymen, I can tell how consumed she is within her desire. I controlled my stretched appendage to back away from her hymen, and curled upward to her sensitive g-spot. Tanya&rsquo;s hips buck against my face once more in response while my mouth envelops her pussy. I suckled her sweet nectar while my tongue stroking her sensitive area forced her body to produce more. In practically no time, her moans increased in volume from the stimulation and inevitably to her first orgasm. Upon consuming the girls juices, I could tell lovely Tanya was fertile. My arousal peaked knowing this.</p>
<p>My mouth left her wet pussy with an audible slurp before I positioned myself for the point of no return. The girl looked up at me, nearly breathless already from the foreplay. The look in her glazed eyes could not deny the need from her body. I willed the shadow to release the bonds at her wrists. Instantly her small arms wrapped around my neck and her legs spread, knees bent and tucked back a bit. The tip of my rock-hard erection touched her moist lips. Tanya shivered. I gave her only seconds to prepare. My cock twitched, moistening the tip and sides against her entrance. I pushed. She held onto me, her breath hot against my face. I eased myself more into her until I felt it touch her hymen. My gaze locked with hers before I pressed hard in one swift stroke. The tip of my cock ripped through Tanya&rsquo;s hymen and nestled right at her cervix.</p>
<p>The tearing of a girl&rsquo;s virginity is most exquisite, nothing else like it. Her cry of pain against my ear brought a devilish smile to my face. I held her shuddering body to me while I remained motionless atop the preteen girl. Once her sobs subsided, my hips moved slowly at first. I filled her pussy with each thrust. Her hips soon gyrated to match my movements. At a slow pace we moved in synchronization at first, enjoying the devil&rsquo;s dance of fucking my no longer virgin Tanya. Her moans of passion met my groans of desire perfectly. In time, the beautiful blond wanted more as did I, our rhythm accelerated. My arms move to grip her, using her lithe form as leverage to drive my cock deeper and faster into her body. The tip of my penis leaked a bit of pre-cum into her womb and her pussy squeezed it, hungry for more. I obliged the girl knowing our peaks grew closer. I tilt Tanya&rsquo;s head back and pound my cock harder and faster into her squishy cunt. Her cries grew louder as my groans increased. The blonde&rsquo;s little body held me for dear life, signaling the start of her orgasm. In one final thrust, I roar loudly and drove my cock as deep as it could go inside Tanya&rsquo;s pussy. I came nearly a dozen powerful spurts of semen deep into her developed uterus. The screaming girl&rsquo;s orgasm sucked my demon seed further into her fertile womb, drinking it in blissful greed. I felt her body spasm uncontrollably in my arms while I bred my beautiful teen victim, claiming her body as mine for my spawn as of this night.</p>
<p>After our orgasms subsided, I felt her pass out. Her young senses could not take anymore, and understandably so. I got what I wanted, and more. I felt more powerful somehow, rejuvenated and renewed. I slipped my cock out of her freshly fucked pussy and stood up, watching the sleeping Tanya on the ground. I watched my demon seed mixed with her virginal blood slowly ooze out. With a laugh, I walked away and disappear into the shadows, long before dawn. I pondered where to find my next target. Another virgin to ruin. Another girl to breed. For myself. For Baphomet.</p>
