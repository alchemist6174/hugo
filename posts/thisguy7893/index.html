  "articleBody": "A Little Basic Knowledge It all began one Saturday, a few months before I turned eleven. I was outside playing basketball with a few of my friends. All of us except Nick (he’s two years older than me) and me were called inside for dinner by our parents at about the same time. Since it was down to just the two of us we started talking…mostly B.S.‘ing about this and that, then out of nowhere Nick asked me if I had ever jerked off.\nI had no idea what he was talking about, “What?” I asked.\n“You’ve never heard of jerking off?”\n“No.” I replied.\n“It’s when a guy rubs his dick until it shoots…” he told me.\n“I don’t rub my dick to pee,” said, assuming he was trying to get me to say something stupid that he could use to make fun of me later.\n“No.” he chuckled, “it’s a LOT better than peeing.” I was now thoroughly confused. “Come on, I’ll show you.” he said, walking over to the cluster of pine trees we sometimes pretended was a fort.\nOnce we were in the little clearing in the middle of the cluster of trees Nick pulled down the front of his pants and underpants. His soft dick fell out. Holding his dick between his thumb and index finger he began shaking his dick up and down: it gradually got longer, thicker, and harder. What Nick was doing looked kind’a fun so I said, “I’m gonna jerk off too,” and pulled my pants and underpants down.\n“Alright, just copy what I do.” Nick told me. Once his dick was fully hard he wrapped all his fingers around it and began moving his fist up and down its length. “Oh, yeah it helps if you think or talk about girls when you jerk off…”\nAfter about two minutes of stroking his dick Nick began quietly moaning , “Sarah, oh Sarah…” then without warning he groaned, “Here it comes…” all of a sudden a glob of white cream shot out of the little hole on the end of his dick. Then a split second later more of it shot out, then more…\n“Wow…” was all I could think as I intently watched the globs of white cream shoot out of Nick’s dick, while continuing to stroke my own dick. A second or so after the white cream stopped shooting out of Nick’s dick, I felt my butt-cheeks tighten…then my dick started throbbing in my hand…and a small drop of clear liquid oozed out of the little hole on the end of my dick: it felt absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!\nAs I was trying to catch my breath Nick spoke up, “when you get a little older instead of a drop or two of clear liquid oozing out, you’ll shoot the same creamy white goo I did. It feels even better when you shoot cum… That’s what it’s called: cum, or jizm, or baby batter…”\n“Why it would be called ‘baby batter?’” I asked.\n“Well,” he took a breath, “it’s the stuff that makes a baby when it goes in a girl’s pussy.” I was pretty sure what he meant, so I nodded. Then Nick continued, “The more often you jerk off, the sooner you’ll start making cum…” Now I really was confused, thankfully Nick continued explaining, “When you jerk off you’re tricking your body into thinking you’re having sex with a girl. If your body thinks you’re having sex it has a reason to make cum: so the girl can have a baby…”\n***\nThe rest of the day I couldn’t get Nick’s words “… instead of a drop or two of clear liquid oozing out, you’ll shoot the same creamy white goo…it feels even better when you shoot cum…the more often you jerk off, the sooner you’ll start making cum…” out of my head. It had felt incredible when the drop of clear liquid that oozed out of my dick, and if Nick was right about it feeling even better when cum shoots out: I just had to keep jerking-off to find out what that felt like…\nWhen I went to bed that night I decided to try jerking-off again. After changing into my pajamas I laid down and pulled my pj bottoms down to my knees. I assumed I was going to have to shake my dick to make it hard the way I had done earlier that day; however I found it was already hard when I touched it. I closed the fingers of my right hand around the shaft of my dick and began pumping my fist up and down. Wow did that feel good!\nI must have been pumping my fist up and down the length of my dick for ten minutes when I remembered Nick’s advice, “it helps if you think or talk about girls when you jerk off…”\nInitially I tried thinking about Sarah: the ridiculously hot seventeen-year-old girl who lived in the house behind Nick’s; her long legs, her round ass, her full lips, and most importantly her gigantic breasts… After a few minutes of my dick remaining hard but not oozing out the clear liquid, I began to conclude that my dick knew there was no way I was ever going to have sex with her.\nContinuing to pump my fist up and down the length of my dick I began asking myself what I girl I knew who I might actually have a chance of having sex with…then it hit me: my best friend Liz. She’s a year and a few months younger than me. So she isn’t what anyone would call sexy: no breasts, flat butt, thin lips…but not only was she my best friend, and therefore a possible sex partner, but I had seen her in bathing suits plenty of times…\nMere seconds after I began peeling the bathing suit off her body (in my mind), my butt-cheeks tightened. A second later my dick started throbbing in my hand…and once again, a small drop of clear liquid oozed out of the little hole on the end of my dick. Holy shit: that felt GREAT! Once I caught my breath I reached down and pulled my pj bottoms up before quickly falling asleep.\n***\nEven though I wasn’t shooting cum jerking-off felt really good; and if Nick was right about it feeling even better when it shoots cum… From that day on I made sure to jerk off every chance I got: whenever I’ve had a few minutes alone (in the shower, after school before Mom and my little sister get home, when I go to bed)…usually three or four times a day, sometimes more.\n",

<p>It all began one Saturday, a few months before I turned eleven. I was outside playing basketball with a few of my friends.
