  "articleBody": "Only 4 days after that amazing parent’s evening interview at Hannah’s Primary School, the first opportunity to carry out the ‘deal’ Sean made with her teacher had presented itself. It was a Saturday evening, and Hannah’s mother Michelle was doing another 7pm to 3am working shift, leaving Hannah free to be abused. It was good not to leave things hanging for too long, lest Dan Hall got an attack of teacher’s conscious or panic or something and changed his mind. Even worse if he decided to report Sean’s activities with Hannah, but that was highly unlikely as he too would be tarnished disasterously by association. Besides, as he put it himself, this was the opportunity Dan ‘had been waiting for all his adult life’. He had recieved the text message invite from Sean and he confirmed he would be there, 8pm. In the hour before his arrival, while Sean had Hannah alone, it was important to ‘prepare’ the child.\n“He’s coming to see me?” she asked. “Why?” She didn’t ‘get it’, yet.\n“Well, he likes you,” chirped Sean. It was always important to make light of things as much as possible, and resort to discipline only if necessary. “You’re one of his favourite pupils.”\n“A teacher doesn’t normally come to the house, though.” Hannah, instead of smiling at the compliment, wore her cute expression of solemn equilibrium.\n“I know. It’s unusual, but he likes you a lot.”\n“A lot? Do you mean like YOU do?”\n“Yes, that’s it.” Sean smiled, in the nice way you do when a child had understood a point.\n“Oh, right.” Her eyes darted around in contemplation.\n“You’re not scared, are you? You know him already very well.”\n“Yes. I mean, no.” She shrugged, somberly.\n“He’s going to be gentle, and friendly.” Sean smiled.\n“Okay.” Hannah’s breathing - slow and tight - betrayed her mask of calm.\n“All YOU have to do is be gentle and friendly in return.”\n“I know.”\n‘Bloody fascinating’, mused Sean. Always bloody fascinating, training a child in sex - and 9 years old was about the perfect age for it. Maybe 11, physically speaking, but by then they getting a little too headstrong. It was going to be doubly fascinating having a teacher on board as an ally, since a teacher is, well… expert in ’teaching’. It would be fun managing Hannah’s behaviour between them, and it would be nice to watch another guy getting his life’s dream of sex with a child. And Hannah was one of the prettiest of children: average height and weight for 9, brown straight hair just past shoulder-length and a lovely, round and smooth little face. Her eyes were the real killer, mused Sean: ocean blue and getting a carnal quality to them, yet still child-sweet. Uh, no, actually - her arse was the real killer, the small and pert child buttocks and crack that cried out for molesting. Sean wondered what Dan would be most eager to do with her.\n“So, ‘gentle and friendly’,” Sean reiterated, with a calm but authoritative smile. “He’ll be nice with you if you’re nice with him -just like school in general, really.”\n“Yeah, okay.” Hannah tweaked her hair, and hugged herself momentarily as if caught in a chill breeze.\n“Don’t sulk if you don’t like the idea of something he wants, and don’t get grumpy or tetchy.”\n“I knowww,” moaned Hannah.\n“I’m just saying. He’s a guest, and he’s important. Nobody expects you to be an ’expert’ at things, but only to try, willingly, okay?”\n“Okayy!” she said, tetchily.\n“Hey. What was I just saying?”\n“Sorry.” Hannah put on a smile. It was so amazing, and luscious, how a child could adopt a sweet smile that was for-all-the world genuine, even if she was not truly happy.\n“Okay, sweetie. It would be a nice touch if you could go the extra mile, too.”\n“What do you mean?”\nSean sighed, but did not go too hard on her. “I mean show ‘initiative’. Say nice things to him, show courtesies, and volunteer to do things for him without being told or asked first.”\n“Oh, okay. Like what?”\nSean patiently and firmly explained some examples to her.\n* * * * *\nMr Daniel Hall, 32-year-old teacher of Year 5 at St Luke’s Primary School, was precisely on time. He looked remarkably ’normal’, like he was there to give a report rather than sexually molest a 9-year-old girl for several hours. “Oh, thank you, Hannah,” he said.\n“You’re welcome.” She took his coat off him and put it on the hook.\n“Come through, Dan,” said Sean. It was quite a buzz to be the ‘host in sexual abuse’.\n“Prettier than ever,” said Dan. “You sweet little thing.” He stooped the give Hannah a kiss on the forehead, taking her head gently in his hands. She smiled bashfully. It was a promising start, mused Sean. Dan was up for it, no doubt about it.\nThey settled in the lounge, Hannah offered to get Dan a drink, and then went to get it: an apple juice only, he was tee-total. “Christ, she’s a beauty,” he said. “Looks kind of more grown up in casual clothes.”\n“You think? Yeah, I guess she does. I’m used to seeing her both ways.”\n“Definately looks younger, smaller, more childlike in class in her school outfit,” said Dan.\nSean had thought it best to present her in her sexy child-jeans which clung to her little ass and hips, and a short little vest that revealed a touch of belly, but now it occured to him he should have more effort for a guy of class, such as Dan. “Do you like her in those clothes?”\n“Hell yes, lovely.”\n“We can change her, if you want.”\nDan contemplated, then looked a little guilty. “Um, what about her school uniform?”\n“What about it?” Sean grinned. “You want her in it?”\n“Yes,” said Dan, grinning back, hesitantly.\n“Anything you want, mate.”\nWhen Hannah returned, Sean asked her to go up and change. She demured, with a little furrow of her brow. “Shit. Cute, mate,” said Dan, sighing. “After all this time…”\n“Yeah, well, tonight’s your chance, my friend.”\nDan shrugged. “She’s been there. She’s done it. The abuse has already happened. It doesn’t make much difference what I do.”\n“Yeah, quite right. Why call it ‘abuse’ anyway? It’s just an alternative lifestyle for a child. A different kind of skill to learn. She’s doing okay.”\nActually, mused Sean, it DID make some difference what Dan did, and Dan must have realised this too. He would be the first guy, aside from Sean, to use her sexually. It would be Hannah’s first experience of another man in the world outside of her guardian, Sean, to ‘befriend’ her in this way. The fact that that man was her schoolteacher for the past 8 months HAD to be a shock to her system. This prominent person in her life was now going to take her in ’that’ way also. Surely it was going to completely colour her understanding of authority figures, and she would never be sure who wanted her in ’that’ way henceforth. Her life would be pretty upside down, compared to the most of the other kids, and maybe she’d never recover. So be it, mused Sean.\n“Good,” said Dan. “I think we should monitor her behaviour carefully between us, though, from now on.”\n“I agree. In fact, that’s one good reason when I like you onboard. You’ll be a good reader of those things.”\n“I’ll do my best to help.”\n“So, you’re committed?” checked Sean.\n“Yes. This is my one chance,” said Dan, with resolution. “I’ve always thought if I could do it just once, I’d be happy with the memory then for the rest of my life, and this is the perfect situation. It’s not like I’m breaking in a new child, or destroying her innocence.”\n“Not at all. Just a word of warning, though…”\n“Yes?”\n“When you’ve done it once, I don’t think you will be satisfied. Mate, you are just going to want it again and again. Once you’ve had sex with a child, there’s no better thing in the world. It’s so… well, ’extreme’. So unique and so nice.”\nDan nodded attentively, gravely. “Yeah, I understand. I’ve seen vids, so I know the allure of it well enough.”\n“Okay, just so you know. You’ll almost certainly want more, and you’ve got an open invite to come back for more, okay?”\n“Hell, thanks.”\n* * * * *\n10 minutes later, it was kind of surreal what Sean was seeing. Hannah, in the grey trousers, white blouse and blue sweater of her school uniform was perched sideways on Dan’s lap while he was speaking to her in kind tones - like her teacher, which he was!\n“You’ve done very well this term, Hannah,” he said. He was looking into her face and tickled under her chin, while she looked at him meekly. “You tried hard in numeracy, and got better at literacy.”\nShe smiled coyly, blushing, totally unaccustomed - yet - to this ‘kind’ of attention from her teacher. It was a great sight: it was inescapably sexual and abnormal, a 9-year-old on male teacher’s lap, whereas a 6-year-old might have been acceptable. To add to the impression of ‘molestation’, as opposed to simple affection, Dan’s broad hips were in flux a little under Hannah’s little rump. The guy was almost certainly getitng stiff already, and Sean could tell this from knowing Hannah’s expressions. She was probably already anticipating what she would have to do with that stiff thing - anything from simply handling it to ejaculation to having it painfully pushed inside her vagina or anus.\n“You’re my favourite pupil, you lovely little thing,” continued Dan. He stroked her cheek with his knuckles, rubbed her back and started pecking at her face. Hannah nervously accepted everything coming her way.\n“You’re my favourite teacher, too,” said Hannah.\n“Aww, sweetie, bet Sean told you to say that.” He did not seem to mind, though, and cradled her face in both his hands, flattenining her baby-soft brown hair sensuously back behind her head.\nSean then spectated on a slow, exquisitely precise mouth-kissing session for several minutes. Dan’s adult male lips, investigated the skills of closing on a child’s, and experimented with the potential for his big tongue. He dragged and flicked it across Hannah’s tender mouth, and circulated it around it and slupped on each of her cheeks. Often he returned to kissing her forehead, an action which gave the impression of love as well as lust. There was no doubt about the lust part, though, as Dan continued to roll his hips under her, and now combined it with feeling up inside her sweater.\n“Let’s take this off,” he said, a little breathlessly. He started the removal, but Hannah quickly and obediently completed it, leaving her hair trailing in its wake. She gave her head a little shake afterward. Dan responded by slipping his fingers through it in relish and smiling affection.\nSean caught Hannah’s eye and nodded to her. “Mr Hall?” said Hannah.\n“Yes, lovely?”\n“Would you like me to suck you off?” The words were not easy for her, but she said them nice and articulate.\nDan swallowed. “Um, maybe, uh no, not now. Thanks, Hannah, that was polite to ask, though.”\n“I… don’t mind if you fuck me up the arse.” Now, she sounded wooden saying that.\n“Oh, no, no, sweetie. I don’t want to hurt you. You’re my favourite,” he explained, and kissed the corners of her narrow little mouth. He also proceeded to unbutton her blouse.\n“What you could do now, though, is undress for me - completely - and then I’ll give you a question.” He smiled genially.\nBoth men watched with keen smiles as the child took off her remaining layers in the middle of the living room. The removal of trousers and knickers particularly had Dan transfixed. Even Sean, after more than a year of molesting her, sighed at the totality of her tender nudity. Female curves were at a minimum on this miniature-woman body, with breasts none at all. Likewise pubic hair was none at all, and her smooth buttocks were small and no different to a boy of her age, really. Dan then undressed too, and Hannah observed with a mild startled expression, even though she must have known it was likely. Her eyes flitted back and forth from his ample erection: a good 6 or 7 inches, reflected Sean, and a good thickness by most men’s standards.\n“Here’s the question, sweetie. I want YOU to decide what you’d like to do most: suck me off, like you offered, or make love on the chair, or I bum-wank you?” Dan knew that Hannah knew what these entailed, he having discussed with Sean the ‘10 favourite things’.\nHannah contemplated, earnestly, as if she was in class being asked to choose a topic for study. “I- I don’t know. Whatever you prefer.”\n“Hey, don’t give me that,” said Dan in a gentle teacherly admonishment. “No ‘don’t knows’.”\n“Come on, Hannah,” said Sean, more tersely.\n“Okay, uh, bum-wank,” she said, timidly.\nSean smiled in satisfaction: it never ceased to be a buzz hearing such a young girl use such language - such carnal words with such innocent intonation.\n“That’s a great choice, Hannah,” said Dan. He smiled playfully. “Let’s have some fun!” He ruffled the side of her head with his knuckles, as he stood up sporting hairly balls and an upright penis at her chest-height.\n“After you’re done, I want you to give me a blow-job, Hannah,” said Sean.\nHannah nodded, then took up her position on all fours on the carpet for the bum-wanking by the new(ish) adult male abuser in her life.\nTHE END\n",

Besides, as he put it himself, this was the opportunity Dan &lsquo;had been waiting for all his adult life&rsquo;. He had recieved the text message invite from Sean and he confirmed he would be there, 8pm. In the hour before his arrival, while Sean had Hannah alone, it was important to &lsquo;prepare&rsquo; the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming to see me?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;get it&rsquo;, yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he likes you,&rdquo; chirped Sean. It was always important to make light of things as much as possible, and resort to discipline only if necessary. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of his favourite pupils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A teacher doesn&rsquo;t normally come to the house, though.&rdquo; Hannah, instead of smiling at the compliment, wore her cute expression of solemn equilibrium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. It&rsquo;s unusual, but he likes you a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot? Do you mean like YOU do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; Sean smiled, in the nice way you do when a child had understood a point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right.&rdquo; Her eyes darted around in contemplation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not scared, are you? You know him already very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I mean, no.&rdquo; She shrugged, somberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be gentle, and friendly.&rdquo; Sean smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Hannah&rsquo;s breathing - slow and tight - betrayed her mask of calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All YOU have to do is be gentle and friendly in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bloody fascinating&rsquo;, mused Sean. Always bloody fascinating, training a child in sex - and 9 years old was about the perfect age for it. Maybe 11, physically speaking, but by then they getting a little too headstrong. It was going to be doubly fascinating having a teacher on board as an ally, since a teacher is, well&hellip; expert in &rsquo;teaching&rsquo;. It would be fun managing Hannah&rsquo;s behaviour between them, and it would be nice to watch another guy getting his life&rsquo;s dream of sex with a child. And Hannah was one of the prettiest of children: average height and weight for 9, brown straight hair just past shoulder-length and a lovely, round and smooth little face. Her eyes were the real killer, mused Sean: ocean blue and getting a carnal quality to them, yet still child-sweet. Uh, no, actually - her arse was the real killer, the small and pert child buttocks and crack that cried out for molesting. Sean wondered what Dan would be most eager to do with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, &lsquo;gentle and friendly&rsquo;,&rdquo; Sean reiterated, with a calm but authoritative smile. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be nice with you if you&rsquo;re nice with him -just like school in general, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay.&rdquo; Hannah tweaked her hair, and hugged herself momentarily as if caught in a chill breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sulk if you don&rsquo;t like the idea of something he wants, and don&rsquo;t get grumpy or tetchy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowww,&rdquo; moaned Hannah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying. He&rsquo;s a guest, and he&rsquo;s important. Nobody expects you to be an &rsquo;expert&rsquo; at things, but only to try, willingly, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okayy!&rdquo; she said, tetchily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey. What was I just saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; Hannah put on a smile. It was so amazing, and luscious, how a child could adopt a sweet smile that was for-all-the world genuine, even if she was not truly happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, sweetie. It would be a nice touch if you could go the extra mile, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sean sighed, but did not go too hard on her. &ldquo;I mean show &lsquo;initiative&rsquo;. Say nice things to him, show courtesies, and volunteer to do things for him without being told or asked first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, okay. Like what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sean patiently and firmly explained some examples to her.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Mr Daniel Hall, 32-year-old teacher of Year 5 at St Luke&rsquo;s Primary School, was precisely on time. He looked remarkably &rsquo;normal&rsquo;, like he was there to give a report rather than sexually molest a 9-year-old girl for several hours. &ldquo;Oh, thank you, Hannah,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo; She took his coat off him and put it on the hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come through, Dan,&rdquo; said Sean. It was quite a buzz to be the &lsquo;host in sexual abuse&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prettier than ever,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;You sweet little thing.&rdquo; He stooped the give Hannah a kiss on the forehead, taking her head gently in his hands. She smiled bashfully. It was a promising start, mused Sean. Dan was up for it, no doubt about it.</p>
<p>They settled in the lounge, Hannah offered to get Dan a drink, and then went to get it: an apple juice only, he was tee-total. &ldquo;Christ, she&rsquo;s a beauty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Looks kind of more grown up in casual clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think? Yeah, I guess she does. I&rsquo;m used to seeing her both ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Definately looks younger, smaller, more childlike in class in her school outfit,&rdquo; said Dan.</p>
<p>Sean had thought it best to present her in her sexy child-jeans which clung to her little ass and hips, and a short little vest that revealed a touch of belly, but now it occured to him he should have more effort for a guy of class, such as Dan. &ldquo;Do you like her in those clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell yes, lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can change her, if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan contemplated, then looked a little guilty. &ldquo;Um, what about her school uniform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; Sean grinned. &ldquo;You want her in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dan, grinning back, hesitantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you want, mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Hannah returned, Sean asked her to go up and change. She demured, with a little furrow of her brow. &ldquo;Shit. Cute, mate,&rdquo; said Dan, sighing. &ldquo;After all this time&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, well, tonight&rsquo;s your chance, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan shrugged. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been there. She&rsquo;s done it. The abuse has already happened. It doesn&rsquo;t make much difference what I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, quite right. Why call it &lsquo;abuse&rsquo; anyway? It&rsquo;s just an alternative lifestyle for a child. A different kind of skill to learn. She&rsquo;s doing okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, mused Sean, it DID make some difference what Dan did, and Dan must have realised this too. He would be the first guy, aside from Sean, to use her sexually. It would be Hannah&rsquo;s first experience of another man in the world outside of her guardian, Sean, to &lsquo;befriend&rsquo; her in this way. The fact that that man was her schoolteacher for the past 8 months HAD to be a shock to her system. This prominent person in her life was now going to take her in &rsquo;that&rsquo; way also. Surely it was going to completely colour her understanding of authority figures, and she would never be sure who wanted her in &rsquo;that&rsquo; way henceforth. Her life would be pretty upside down, compared to the most of the other kids, and maybe she&rsquo;d never recover. So be it, mused Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;I think we should monitor her behaviour carefully between us, though, from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree. In fact, that&rsquo;s one good reason when I like you onboard. You&rsquo;ll be a good reader of those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re committed?&rdquo; checked Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. This is my one chance,&rdquo; said Dan, with resolution. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought if I could do it just once, I&rsquo;d be happy with the memory then for the rest of my life, and this is the perfect situation. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m breaking in a new child, or destroying her innocence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. Just a word of warning, though&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve done it once, I don&rsquo;t think you will be satisfied. Mate, you are just going to want it again and again. Once you&rsquo;ve had sex with a child, there&rsquo;s no better thing in the world. It&rsquo;s so&hellip; well, &rsquo;extreme&rsquo;. So unique and so nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan nodded attentively, gravely. &ldquo;Yeah, I understand. I&rsquo;ve seen vids, so I know the allure of it well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, just so you know. You&rsquo;ll almost certainly want more, and you&rsquo;ve got an open invite to come back for more, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell, thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>10 minutes later, it was kind of surreal what Sean was seeing. Hannah, in the grey trousers, white blouse and blue sweater of her school uniform was perched sideways on Dan&rsquo;s lap while he was speaking to her in kind tones - like her teacher, which he was!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done very well this term, Hannah,&rdquo; he said. He was looking into her face and tickled under her chin, while she looked at him meekly. &ldquo;You tried hard in numeracy, and got better at literacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled coyly, blushing, totally unaccustomed - yet - to this &lsquo;kind&rsquo; of attention from her teacher. It was a great sight: it was inescapably sexual and abnormal, a 9-year-old on male teacher&rsquo;s lap, whereas a 6-year-old might have been acceptable. To add to the impression of &lsquo;molestation&rsquo;, as opposed to simple affection, Dan&rsquo;s broad hips were in flux a little under Hannah&rsquo;s little rump. The guy was almost certainly getitng stiff already, and Sean could tell this from knowing Hannah&rsquo;s expressions. She was probably already anticipating what she would have to do with that stiff thing - anything from simply handling it to ejaculation to having it painfully pushed inside her vagina or anus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my favourite pupil, you lovely little thing,&rdquo; continued Dan. He stroked her cheek with his knuckles, rubbed her back and started pecking at her face. Hannah nervously accepted everything coming her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my favourite teacher, too,&rdquo; said Hannah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aww, sweetie, bet Sean told you to say that.&rdquo; He did not seem to mind, though, and cradled her face in both his hands, flattenining her baby-soft brown hair sensuously back behind her head.</p>
<p>Sean then spectated on a slow, exquisitely precise mouth-kissing session for several minutes. Dan&rsquo;s adult male lips, investigated the skills of closing on a child&rsquo;s, and experimented with the potential for his big tongue. He dragged and flicked it across Hannah&rsquo;s tender mouth, and circulated it around it and slupped on each of her cheeks. Often he returned to kissing her forehead, an action which gave the impression of love as well as lust. There was no doubt about the lust part, though, as Dan continued to roll his hips under her, and now combined it with feeling up inside her sweater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take this off,&rdquo; he said, a little breathlessly. He started the removal, but Hannah quickly and obediently completed it, leaving her hair trailing in its wake. She gave her head a little shake afterward. Dan responded by slipping his fingers through it in relish and smiling affection.</p>
<p>Sean caught Hannah&rsquo;s eye and nodded to her. &ldquo;Mr Hall?&rdquo; said Hannah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lovely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like me to suck you off?&rdquo; The words were not easy for her, but she said them nice and articulate.</p>
<p>Dan swallowed. &ldquo;Um, maybe, uh no, not now. Thanks, Hannah, that was polite to ask, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip; don&rsquo;t mind if you fuck me up the arse.&rdquo; Now, she sounded wooden saying that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, sweetie. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you. You&rsquo;re my favourite,&rdquo; he explained, and kissed the corners of her narrow little mouth. He also proceeded to unbutton her blouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you could do now, though, is undress for me - completely - and then I&rsquo;ll give you a question.&rdquo; He smiled genially.</p>
<p>Both men watched with keen smiles as the child took off her remaining layers in the middle of the living room. The removal of trousers and knickers particularly had Dan transfixed. Even Sean, after more than a year of molesting her, sighed at the totality of her tender nudity. Female curves were at a minimum on this miniature-woman body, with breasts none at all. Likewise pubic hair was none at all, and her smooth buttocks were small and no different to a boy of her age, really. Dan then undressed too, and Hannah observed with a mild startled expression, even though she must have known it was likely. Her eyes flitted back and forth from his ample erection: a good 6 or 7 inches, reflected Sean, and a good thickness by most men&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the question, sweetie. I want YOU to decide what you&rsquo;d like to do most: suck me off, like you offered, or make love on the chair, or I bum-wank you?&rdquo; Dan knew that Hannah knew what these entailed, he having discussed with Sean the &lsquo;10 favourite things&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Hannah contemplated, earnestly, as if she was in class being asked to choose a topic for study. &ldquo;I- I don&rsquo;t know. Whatever you prefer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t give me that,&rdquo; said Dan in a gentle teacherly admonishment. &ldquo;No &lsquo;don&rsquo;t knows&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Hannah,&rdquo; said Sean, more tersely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, uh, bum-wank,&rdquo; she said, timidly.</p>
<p>Sean smiled in satisfaction: it never ceased to be a buzz hearing such a young girl use such language - such carnal words with such innocent intonation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great choice, Hannah,&rdquo; said Dan. He smiled playfully. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some fun!&rdquo; He ruffled the side of her head with his knuckles, as he stood up sporting hairly balls and an upright penis at her chest-height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you&rsquo;re done, I want you to give me a blow-job, Hannah,&rdquo; said Sean.</p>
<p>Hannah nodded, then took up her position on all fours on the carpet for the bum-wanking by the new(ish) adult male abuser in her life.</p>
<p>THE END</p>
