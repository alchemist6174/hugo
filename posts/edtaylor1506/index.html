  "articleBody": "Star Trek was over, so I suggested “Let’s go downstairs.” We have a finished basement with a big queen sized bed. Dad had a dark room and did his camera stuff in the basement, too.\nI wasn’t really sure what to do when we got downstairs, but we sat on the edge of the bed and Lisa started rubbing my thing some more. The problem was it had gotten kinda soft again. Lisa unzipped my pants and put her hand down my shorts. “Oh, that feels good,” I said as she squeezed it hard again.\nI lay back on the bed. Lisa rubbed my thing up and down it felt really good. Then she leaned down and kissed it. I jumped, scaring her again.\nShe started to cry again, so I hug her, not knowing what else to do.\n“I’m sorry,” I told her, “You surprised me again.” She sniffed a bit. “But I really like it,” I added. “You can do it again,” I said smiling. I leaned back and she bent down and sucked my hard little cock into her mouth.\nIt felt wonderful, amazing, totally better than when I played with myself. As she was sucking me, she pulled down her panties and was playing with herself. I reached over and touched her there and she was all wet. I wondered if she had peed herself, but it was slippery more than just wet like pee. She moaned around my cock as I touched her.\nLisa slid around until her wet pussy was in my face. At first I was like “Eww,” but she was sucking my cock, and smell didn’t smell that bad, just a little strange. So, I kissed her down there and she moaned again, louder. I kissed it a few more times and Lisa paused her sucking long to say “Lick it.”\nI wasn’t sure, but I licked my lips and it didn’t taste that bad either, so I licked it slowly from the top where she had a little pink ridge down to the bottom where the wet juices seemed to come from. She really moaned as I licked the little ridge, so I focused on that. The more I licked the more she moaned. She got louder and louder and started bouncing around so much I had trouble keeping my tongue on her. Her sucking on my cock got kinda harder and crazy, too. I was about to make her stop because it was beginning to feel really strange when all of a sudden she screamed and clamped her legs around my head, grinding her pussy into my face.\nWhen Lisa finally calmed down (and let me breathe), she rolled off me and smiled. “That was great, Eddie.”\n“What happened?” I asked.\n“I came.”\n“You what?”\nShe looked at me as if I asked what air was. “I came, silly. Haven’t you ever cum before?”\n“Sure, lots of times,” I lied.\n“Huh,” she said not believing me. Then she reached over and stroked my still hard cock. “I love your cock, Edward. Can I fuck you?” she asked.\nI was stunned. I kinda knew what fucking was, because I saw my daddy and momma doing it once when we were camping and they thought I was asleep. But I thought it was something a boy did to a girl, not the other way around. I didn’t say anything but just nodded.\nLisa smiled and climbed on top of me. She grabbed my cock and pointed it between her legs as she slowly slid down onto it. OH. MY. GOD. It felt incredible. Hot and Wet and Tight. When she reached bottom she stopped for a moment and smiled.\nI was kinda stunned by all of this and just laid back and looked at her. She was smiling down at me, then started to bounce up and down on my cock. The great feelings got even better. I grabbed her by the hips and started to bounce up as she bounced down. My cock had been a little raw earlier, but now, in her tight wet cunt it was feeling better than it ever had. This was much better than even with Jimmy. ‘Wow, I ’m fucking!’ I thought, ‘Jimmy will be so jealous.’\nLisa leaned forward and put her hands on my shoulders. She closed her eyes and seemed to be concentrating as we pounded into each other. I was beginning to get that funny feeling again and almost wanted to stop, but Lisa kept riding me harder and faster. She was breathing faster and faster until she slammed down on me and let out a loud squeal. I felt her cunt squeeze my hard cock even tighter and almost ripple up and down or something. It was too much for me and it felt like my cock and guts exploded. I grunted in surprise and threw her off me. She almost landed on the floor, but I was looking at my cock. It was bouncing up and down as waves of pleasure ripped through me. I grabbed it and it leapt again harder as I rubbed my hand up and down it. Finally, after what seemed like hours, the explosions and rippling in my gut faded and I collapsed, letting go of my cock, exhausted.\n“Why did you push me off?” Lisa asked.\n“I don’t know…surprised me,” I mumbled. It was weird, but I was so sleepy all of a sudden.\n“Hah, I made you cum, just like my daddy!”\n“Wha? Your daddy?” I managed.\nShe got real scared and jumped up. “I have to go,” she said, and started pulling on her clothes.\nI didn’t care and I drifted off to sleep. I vaguely remember hearing her run up the basement steps as she left.\n",
