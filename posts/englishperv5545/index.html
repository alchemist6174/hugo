  "articleBody": "SEAN HOLLAND (35) step-father to Hannah, slightly Sean Bean lookalike.\nYou know what, I always used to think it was Hannah’s age, but now I’ve changed my mind [pats Hannah on the head]. Hell, all ages are great, and sometimes I feel like I’m in the mood for a real smallie - ‘bout 5 or 6 - but if push came to shove I’ve got to say 14-15 is ideal. You can fuck ’em so much harder, and they can reciprocate sexuality properly. The moves of a skinny teen who knows what it’s about, but in a naive kind of way, the sexuality but girlieness of her voice - beautiful. Nothing beats a pubescent with her legs wide open, cute bit of fuzz, nice apple-tits to get your hands on. Okay, so ideally, I’d say a redhead 15-year-old pale as hell, some freckles, good development but still with growing to do. And fucking her nice, prominent, filling-out white arse would be my favourite pastime.\nDANIEL HALL (32) Hannah’s schoolteacher, plain and bespectacled guy.\nFor me it’s easy: Hannah here, no-one else [he is next to her on the sofa and gives her a cuddle, she blushes]. I love her sweet nature, she’s such a good girl. And she’s a perfect princess in looks for me: just adore the straight-haired, sleek shoulder-length look, and mousy brown is just fine. Eyes like an ocean, and cute button-nose. Yeah, yeah, okay Simon, we know she’s got a sexy little arse too. It’s love-making with a child, though, the complete package. That’s what it’s all about for me. I want to feel the emotional attachment. 10 is the perfect age, I think, the apogee of their childhood kind of but still not hitting puberty quite yet. The innocent nature is there still, and so so slender and small. I’ll love Hannah at any age, though, and I’d to have babies with her when she gets old enough, and then marry her when she’s old enough.\nBILL SMITH (65) Old friend of Dan’s, role-playing enthusiast.\nAgree with what Dan says about 10. For girls, it’s perfect, so slim and cute. Decent penetration possible, and they can learn to suck well. I’d be torn between that and a boy of about 14/15, though [hoots of laughter, and queries]. Hey, every man has a gay streak, if we’re honest, even if small. After a while you realise that an arse is an arse, and not even any damn difference between boy or girl up to about 11 [some murmurs of disagreement]. Hey, if you cut a girl’s hair, you know, often you would not be able to tell the difference by face alone. Something for you to think about. Well, if I’m girl mood, it’s a 9/10yo Thai or Philippino to mainly sodomize or mouth-fuck. If I’m in boy mood, it’s the full round of sex with a 15yo Italian or Greek kid - love the complexions - old enough to produce cum but young enough to look girlie still.\nSIMON ADAMS (37) Bryan Adams lookalike, more hard-edged friend of Sean.\nYou know, Bill, a 5-year-old or even a 3-year-old can ’learn to suck well’ as you put it [some moans of disdain]. Ok, 3 is borderline. Not often I can fancy one, but depends what she looks like - remember that blonde Maddie, ohhhhh, yeah! - but I’d say 5 or 6 is my favourite. I’m kind of like Sean in that I have my ’teen moments’ too. If I had to choose one ideal girl in the world, though, it’s gonna be a 5-6yo either blonde or dark-haired. Either way, must be Caucasian - I find it hotter abusing a little girl from my own culture for some reason - and from a well-to-do background. They’re always sweeter that way. No frills, no make-up, just loose-raggedy hair as nature intended. Huge adult hard-on in extremely little and young mouth, can’t beat it! Stunning juxtaposition. Also, amazing how girlie and shapely their asses can be at that age too. Funnily enough, they tend to get tinier skinny asses between 7-10.\nRICHARD HURST (27) a cousin of Simon’s, visited Hannah once in the night.\nWell, Hannah is the only kid I done in a hardcore way, so hard to say [most of them don’t know him, so they asks him about it]. I got off in her mouth when Simon let me come round one night. No offence to Hannah [she listens with a dour expression to all this], but I guess ideally I’d choose a more dark-skinned girlie. About 12, just gettin’ little tits, maybe a Latino. Ya, let’s say a sexy petite Brazilian, with puppy-fat and puppy tits, and just old enough to breed. Would love to put a bun in her oven. Then shag her nice arse.\nANTHONY HARRISON (40) ’expert’ contact of Simon’s, deals in illegal immigrants.\nI’m in two minds. The age has got to be 7. I love how they’re often so skinny at that age, no feminization to their bodies whatsoever, chests as flat as an ironing board, all ribs and tender skin. Good point by Simon about their asses too, but I like them like that: damn, you can actually scoop her up into your lap with one hand round her bum, and it looks sensational when you try to put a cock in it. It’s either a long-haired blonde English girl - I had one once, ‘Georgina’, and she learnt to suck like a trooper - or a tanned middle-eastern. A little Iraqi girl would be a delight, not only for the way they look but the obvious political and cultural edge of it [‘fuck, yes,’ murmurs Simon, ’their hair and faces’]. The bread and butter business with a 7-year-old is mouth of course, and their faces are so small and cute, like little works of art.\nROBERT SAINT (41) businessman who bought time with Hannah off the street.\nWell, hey, um, I’m with Dan. Can’t really beat Hannah. What a delectable picture of delight she is [he smiles at her, she blushes. Dan keeps an arm around her shoulder]. Uh, don’t worry Dan - uh, or Sean - I’m not trying to steal her from you. No, seriously, let me think. Okay… ideal scenario is an Indian 13-year-old given to me in an arranged marriage. Maybe some political thing, from history. Delectable, exotic bronze skin and that unique smell they have, you know? [‘curry’, says Simon. They laugh]. Well, whatever, I think their skin has an original scent regardless. So, I get her in marriage, and I have to consummate it - of course - but I also have to make a baby with her, by the terms of the agreement. We just have to keep trying, overcoming her difficulties and pain with it and our initial awkwardness together, fucking her night after night, timing it with her cycle, until we succeed.\nKEVIN MCINTYRE (26) friend of Simon’s, gawkish guy met Hannah once so far.\nUm, I dunno really. I like any, as long as she’s pretty enough like Hannah. Just wonderin’ when I’m gonna get to do Hannah’s arse? [she frowns, Dan looks unamused, and cuddles her. Sean and Simon sigh, and Bill tells him to just get into the spirit of the chat for now]. Okay, well, Hannah is sexy but I’ve seen better [Dan sticks a finger to him, but he doesn’t see]. I think, maybe, uh, 13 is the best age too. Yeah, a redhead 13 or a posh blonde girl. I’m kind of curious, uh, to try younger than Hannah too, though. [They sigh. ‘He doesn’t know’, says Anthony]. Yeah, I do. I just said: 13 is my favourite, with a bit more tit than Hannah and a hairy muff. And licking her fat arse, or doing her doggy-position.\nThe End\nany feedback welcome here or to my email.\n",

No offence to Hannah [she listens with a dour expression to all this], but I guess ideally I&rsquo;d choose a more dark-skinned girlie. About 12, just gettin&rsquo; little tits, maybe a Latino.

<p>ANTHONY HARRISON (40) &rsquo;expert&rsquo; contact of Simon&rsquo;s, deals in illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in two minds. The age has got to be 7. I love how they&rsquo;re often so skinny at that age, no feminization to their bodies whatsoever, chests as flat as an ironing board, all ribs and tender skin. Good point by Simon about their asses too, but I like them like that: damn, you can actually scoop her up into your lap with one hand round her bum, and it looks sensational when you try to put a cock in it. It&rsquo;s either a long-haired blonde English girl - I had one once, &lsquo;Georgina&rsquo;, and she learnt to suck like a trooper - or a tanned middle-eastern. A little Iraqi girl would be a delight, not only for the way they look but the obvious political and cultural edge of it [&lsquo;fuck, yes,&rsquo; murmurs Simon, &rsquo;their hair and faces&rsquo;]. The bread and butter business with a 7-year-old is mouth of course, and their faces are so small and cute, like little works of art.</p>

<p>Well, hey, um, I&rsquo;m with Dan. Can&rsquo;t really beat Hannah. What a delectable picture of delight she is [he smiles at her, she blushes. Dan keeps an arm around her shoulder]. Uh, don&rsquo;t worry Dan - uh, or Sean - I&rsquo;m not trying to steal her from you. No, seriously, let me think. Okay&hellip; ideal scenario is an Indian 13-year-old given to me in an arranged marriage. Maybe some political thing, from history. Delectable, exotic bronze skin and that unique smell they have, you know? [&lsquo;curry&rsquo;, says Simon. They laugh]. Well, whatever, I think their skin has an original scent regardless. So, I get her in marriage, and I have to consummate it - of course - but I also have to make a baby with her, by the terms of the agreement. We just have to keep trying, overcoming her difficulties and pain with it and our initial awkwardness together, fucking her night after night, timing it with her cycle, until we succeed.</p>
<p>KEVIN MCINTYRE (26) friend of Simon&rsquo;s, gawkish guy met Hannah once so far.</p>
<p>Um, I dunno really. I like any, as long as she&rsquo;s pretty enough like Hannah. Just wonderin&rsquo; when I&rsquo;m gonna get to do Hannah&rsquo;s arse? [she frowns, Dan looks unamused, and cuddles her. Sean and Simon sigh, and Bill tells him to just get into the spirit of the chat for now]. Okay, well, Hannah is sexy but I&rsquo;ve seen better [Dan sticks a finger to him, but he doesn&rsquo;t see]. I think, maybe, uh, 13 is the best age too. Yeah, a redhead 13 or a posh blonde girl. I&rsquo;m kind of curious, uh, to try younger than Hannah too, though. [They sigh. &lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know&rsquo;, says Anthony]. Yeah, I do. I just said: 13 is my favourite, with a bit more tit than Hannah and a hairy muff. And licking her fat arse, or doing her doggy-position.</p>
