  "articleBody": "My heart started beating erratically at the sight of my 6-year-old knee. Sophie. Long, curly and dark hair, long eyelashes matching her hair, huge brown eyes, little nose and sweet, pinkish lips. She’s pleasant to look at. Not too thin, but not overweight. And she’s always smiling. Always.\nI’m a self-confessed child lover, if you know what I mean. Add that to being a bisexual. My twisted sexual orientation gave me a long, hellishly confusing development process as a teenager. I was still just coming into terms with my bisexuality when I realized I’m into little girls too. Wait, hold on, have I told you I’m a girl? Yup. My name is Kara. I just turned 20 last December and I’m in college. Dark, almost black, shoulder-length hair, 5'6’’, and few pounds heavier than I’m supposed to be to be called normal or average.\nThe only explanation I can think of why I became like this is early exposure to sex. I was just six when I learned about it. My cousin who’s around 18 that time started it. Since I’m an early reader, he supplied me a bunch of erotic reading materials and boy I’m good at imagining things. When I read, I feel like I’m watching a movie. Seeing things, feeling the surrounding, smelling and hearing everything. By the time I’m 8, I know almost everything. Different sexual positions, different ways to pleasure yourself, sex toys, you name it. Now that I think of it, I think my cousin is doing all this so he could make me curious enough to ask for sex. But I don’t know. I didn’t. But maybe he passed the curse onto me. Now I want the same exact things he wanted from me when I was little.\nI don’t exactly tell my friends about my bisexuality but I’m pretty sure they’ve figured that out by now. Hell I’ve kissed some of them, drunk or sober, but I’ve never really get into a serious relationship with girls. At least not for the past 4 years. But me about being a pedo… I’m not sure if a single, breathing, living soul would hear about it.\nAt first, it was very hard for me. I hated myself. I just wanted to be normal. Looking at a little girl for a few minutes means imagining a hundred ways I could touch, smell and taste her. And every time, it makes my throat dry. My hunger for it is driving me crazy. I sometimes think of snatching a child, do whatever I want with her, and then, kill her. And I was just around 10 that time. I would masturbate thinking about little girls instead of my crushes, male and female, in school.\nThen I got smart around my way on the internet. I discovered lolicons. I’d spend a lot of time in front of the computer at night browsing pictures and videos and then I’d pleasure myself before going to bed. Since then, I thought I could satisfy my burning hunger through that. I was so happy because I thought I didn’t even have to trick or hurt someone to get my way. I’ve never been so wrong.\nYesterday, my mom assigned me to be in our small store to attend the cash register. I thought; what the hell? I have internet in there. Most of the time when I bring my laptop with me, I browse pictures, sometimes I even watch videos and our customers don’t have a single clue that there’s a tiny, pink, vibrating thing in between the pussy lips of their cashier.\nI’ve learned how not to be so obvious when I cum. My knees still buckle but I know how to suppress my moans. My favorite part is cumming while punching numbers on the register with a customer in front of me. I wonder if they can hear the vibration. I hope not. I know no one knows about it but still… the thrill… anyway…\nAs most of the days, business is slow around 1-3 pm. Not much customers come in so I figured I’d close the store to take a nap or do whatever. My niece came around that time, wearing a white top with a princess print on it and a blue, polka-dotted, balloon skirt I gave her for Christmas.\n“Hi baby doll, what are you doing here?” That exact moment, her young father came in. He’s my cousin and he’s just like 3 years older than me but he now have two kids. Sophie is his eldest and Angela is two years younger. Both beautiful, beautiful girls.\n“Heyyah.” He greeted me with a salute. “Can I leave her to you? Just for an hour or two? Just gotta run some errands…”\n“Do I have a choice?”\n“Uhm…”\n“You know I’d say yes. Where’s the other smurf?” Sophie giggled. She thought it was silly that I’m calling them smurf. She said she isn’t blue.\n“I didn’t think you could handle both of them… I left her with someone else.”\n“Whatever. Next time, leave both of them to me. Got nothing to do anyways.”\n“Right. Thanks. You’re the-”\n“Best cousin ever? I know. Now, get lost and leave this little angel to me.”\n“Alright. Behave yourself, munchkin.”\n“I’m not a munchkin, but I sure will behave myself.” Said the smiling girl.\nI guided her behind the counter and pulled out the mat I keep on the cabinet.\nSophie is the type of child who doesn’t run out of questions to ask. At first she’s ask what do you call something, and then, what’s it for, and then, what’s it made of. And to be honest, I don’t have much patience for those kind of things. Child or adult, I can still get pretty irritated. Well, with a child I sometimes play along but you know, we all have limits.\nSo to get her quiet, I plugged in my new game controller and started playing an old sega game. My brother decided he wanted to live his childhood life again and asked me to download all our favorite games as children. Chip and Dale, Super Contra, Super Mario, Super Mario 3, Battle City, hell, he even asked for Wrecking Crew and Popeye. I haven’t played Joe and Mac for a while so I picked it. She watched me play without saying a single word. Well, actually, she did. She’s dropping me a few clues about how much she wanted to play the game but of course I ignored them. I’m not letting that kid into my pc. No, no, no.\nThen I got tired of it and started playing a movie instead. We watched Tangled and the girl knew the story well. She knew what would happen next, damn, she knew every word in the movie. I wonder how many times she’d seen it. But just like a normal kid, she don’t care.\nWe sat close to each other and just like a child who don’t give a damn about their panties showing, she sat with her knees bent, her legs spread wide. She’s wearing white panties with pink elastics on the leg holes. There were pink little flowers embroidered all over. Man, she looked so fuckable.\nLucky me, her panties were a little loose on the leg hole. Once in a while, I would take a peek on her smooth, hairless and puffy pussy mound. Suddenly, the movie I’ve seen so many times doesn’t seem to make any sense. I can’t understand what’s going on. All that I’m aware of is that cute, sexy thing beside me. She smelled like strawberry. Probably her shampoo.\nI moved a little to angle myself with a better view of her not so hidden treasure. I’m not even watching the movie anymore. I’m just sitting there, staring.\nAnd then, she slapped her arm and murmured something about mosquitoes. And then, suddenly, a light bulb flashed inside my head. I got a good idea. An excuse to get my hands all over her.\nI stood up and pick up an insect repellant lotion from one of the racks and brought it behind the counter. I started applying some on myself when she asked if she can have some too because mosquitoes are biting her. I squeezed some in her palms but of course, she didn’t know how to apply it properly.\nI got so excited about my plan I thought I’m going to have a heart attack. I squeezed some more lotion into my palms and started rubbing it on her arms like I didn’t really care while deep inside, all I could imagine is sliding my middle finger in and out of her cunt while she begs for more.\nMy hands felt so hot touching her. I spread the lotion very slowly just so I could be in my fantasy a little bit longer. And then, I started on her feet going up until I reached her thighs. I feel my heart beat going nuts, I can hear it beating against my chest and my brain’s all foggy.\nI applied lotion up to her inner thighs and the child didn’t think that there’s something strange about the way I touch her. I’m kind of squeezing and pinching a bit but she’s so focused in the movie. I lifted up her top and started putting lotion in her tummy. I know I didn’t have to apply the lotion in there, but she didn’t. She even helped me by holding up her top so it wouldn’t fall while I’m putting lotion.\nAnd then, just to prolong my own agony, I started on her back instead of directly going to her chest. I squeezed and I rubbed there for a few seconds before I finally went for the target. I can’t see her chest but I felt those two little nubs where her breast would grow in a few years. I squeezed the lotion on both of my hands and got busy rubbing her. I started focusing on her nipples. With both of my hands, I started making little circles around her nipples using my middle fingers. I don’t know if she noticed because she’s not saying anything. Unable to restrict myself, I decided I’d push my luck and make a go for that sweet, golden treasure under her skirt.\nI lifted up her skirt and let my right palm rest on top of her mound. Maybe she didn’t thought of it as weird because again, I didn’t get a reaction. The only time she looked up at me is when I started pressing and fondling.\n“Aunt Kara… what are you doing?” she looked up at me with her huge brown eyes.\n“I’m putting lotion on you.” I answered as a matter of fact-ly.\n“On my panties?”\n“Of course. I have to.” I touched her mounds again while she watches my hand. It was so erotic. I tried to convince myself that she is inviting me to do it. I can’t help it. Me molesting her, and she, just letting me do it.\nDeciding what I’m doing is normal, she went back to her movie but she couldn’t focus especially when I slid two fingers in her leg hole. I took in a deep breath. For so long, I’ve fantasize about something like this… I feel like I’m finally being released.\nWith her eyes focused on what I’m doing but she didn’t utter a single word. It almost looked like she’s afraid. Well, I can get pretty scary when I’m angry.\nI let my fingers feel that puffy pussy lips of hers. I feel so hot in my cunt I thought about masturbating in front of her even though I know I wouldn’t. At least not that time.\nI started rubbing along her slit and she just watched with curious eyes. Sometimes she would look up at me but I would just give her a smile. A few minutes of this and I decided that I could go further. We were sitting on the floor and I lifted her up a bit and made her sit on my lap. I spread her knees as wide as they would go. I was about to start going back to my business when I looked up for no apparent reason and I saw a mirror hanging on the wall. Having yet another light bulb flashed inside my head, I stood up and took the mirror. Strangely, the noisy, full of questions child isn’t saying anything.\nSitting back down, I put her in the same position she was in before I stood up.\nWith no warning, I slid my hand under her underwear and let it rest there for a while feeling the warmth of her little girl pussy. I didn’t know it could be much, much hotter touching her without removing her clothes. I can feel but I can’t see much. It keeps me guessing and it’s making more interested.\nUsing my index and ring finger, I spread her pussy lips apart and let my middle finger in between. At first I just let my middle finger rest in her slit. I need to memorize the feeling so I can fantasize about it later. I started pressing gently and then I moved my finger around in circular motions. I looked in the mirror and to my surprise, she isn’t watching anymore. She’s leaning against me, her head bent back, her eyes closed and her mouth open. She’s drawing in sharp breaths. She is liking it! I never knew a little girl could really feel good about something like that. Are their clits that sensitive already? At that age? I thought it’s only in the illustrations and stories.\nI pulled out my hand from her little girl pussy and I heard the elastic snap on her skin. I brought my fingers near my nose and god help me because I can’t help myself but to put my fingers in my mouth. I sucked on it like a hungry child.\n“Do you like it?” I whispered. She nodded in response and it definitely boosted up my confidence on whatever I’m doing. Maybe this is the day my fantasy would come true!\nI put my hand inside her underwear again and continued touching her. This time I started licking her neck, her arm or whatever my tongue can touch. She’s a little bit salty from sweat but nothing beats the taste of a little girl.\nMe, I like being a little rough when I’m doing a manual job on myself. I started rubbing her faster, squeezing tighter, and pressing harder. It’s impossible that she knew what she’s doing so I concluded that her moving her hips upwards so she could grind on my hand harder is a natural response of an individual getting sexually pleasured.\nI slipped a finger in her leg hole and played with her sex hole without pushing the finger in. I don’t want to break her right there and then. It has to be special for her. Maybe I’d bring her home or something.\nFor a moment there, I forgot it isn’t my pussy I’m playing with. I got a little too rough. She told me to slow down but I couldn’t. I can’t think straight. She told me to stop a few times but she’s letting out naughty sounds in between the pleadings. Fondling and squeezing her mounds is driving me insane. I wanted to squeeze her so hard until she screams.\nAfter a couple of minutes of this, she let out a loud moan while she closed her legs tightly. I’m pretty sure the girl just reached her climax. I can feel her pussy muscles twitching. Oh my god, this is heaven! I can’t explain how I feel. I wanted to jump around the room. But most of all, I wanted to lay her down on the floor, lick that sweet, tight pussy of hers. I actually want to suck and bite it but no, I won’t.\nIt took her a moment before she fell back on my lap. She was breathing heavily and it took her longer to recover. The only time I noticed that her nails dug into my skin was when she released. Also, I got aware of my hands. They’re wet. It took me a while to figure out she peed. She just realized it, too and she looked ready to cry out of embarrassment. She stood in front of me, covering her face. I removed her hands away from her face and gave her a light peck on the lips.\n“It’s okay.”\n“Really?”\n“Yeah. Does it feel good?”\n“I don’t know… Kind of- It felt kind of weird… strange… but yeah, I guess it felt good.”\n“Okay. Come by to my house later. Maybe you could tell your mom you wanted to sleep over? We’d do it again.”\n“But I might pee again…”\n“We won’t tell anybody. Is it a deal then?”\n“Okaaay!” Sophie wrapped her arms around me tightly.\n“Promise me you won’t tell your daddy or anyone what we did, okay?”\n“Why?”\n“Because it’s a secret. And if you tell them, they’d know you peed on your panties. They’d think you’re a baby.”\n“I’m not a baby! Angela is!”\n“I know. That’s why we can’t tell anybody. You’re a big girl now, right? Big girls can keep secrets.”\n“I promise.”\n“Okay then.”\nI grabbed a tissue paper and wiped her between her legs. I told her to leave the panties and hurry back home to put on a fresh one without anybody noticing and come back again so she’d be here when her dad comes back.\nShe went out of our store with a smile on her face, skipping happily.\nI ran to the bathroom to relieve myself. I had her piss-wet panties on my face while I slid a marker in and out of my cunt. I don’t walk around carrying a dildo so I got to improvise. It didn’t take me long anyway since I’m dripping wet already.\nSophie knocked on the door just right after I put on my jeans. I let the girl in and we resumed our little movie. She sprang up when she heard her father came in.\n“Daddy! Can I stay over at Aunt Kara’s house tonight? Please… You’ve gotta let me! She has The Little Mermaid. I haven’t seen that one yet!” Where did that come from? Seriously? Huh. Well I learned to make up stories and lie when I was around four so yeah, I guess it runs in the family… especially when it has something to do with sex. I heard Sophie’s father got busted once peeking on my other cousin while she’s in the bathroom.\n“Can she? Rhea called, she wouldn’t be able to make it home tonight.” Rhea is his partner… they aren’t married so…\n“Of course she can. We’re going to have so much fun.” I winked at her and she beamed at me.\nWell folks, I guess I’m going to be busy tonight.\n",

      Slow Business
    </h1>
    <div class="post-description">
      Not much customer, business is slow so I figured I&#39;d close the store to take a nap or do whatever. That&#39;s when my cousin came in asking me if I can keep an eye on his little girl, Sophie. Who am I to say no?

  <div class="post-content"><p>My heart started beating erratically at the sight of my 6-year-old knee. Sophie. Long, curly and dark hair, long eyelashes matching her hair, huge brown eyes, little nose and sweet, pinkish lips. She&rsquo;s pleasant to look at. Not too thin, but not overweight. And she&rsquo;s always smiling. Always.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a self-confessed child lover, if you know what I mean. Add that to being a bisexual. My twisted sexual orientation gave me a long, hellishly confusing development process as a teenager. I was still just coming into terms with my bisexuality when I realized I&rsquo;m into little girls too. Wait, hold on, have I told you I&rsquo;m a girl? Yup. My name is Kara. I just turned 20 last December and I&rsquo;m in college. Dark, almost black, shoulder-length hair, 5'6&rsquo;&rsquo;, and few pounds heavier than I&rsquo;m supposed to be to be called normal or average.</p>
<p>The only explanation I can think of why I became like this is early exposure to sex. I was just six when I learned about it. My cousin who&rsquo;s around 18 that time started it. Since I&rsquo;m an early reader, he supplied me a bunch of erotic reading materials and boy I&rsquo;m good at imagining things. When I read, I feel like I&rsquo;m watching a movie. Seeing things, feeling the surrounding, smelling and hearing everything. By the time I&rsquo;m 8, I know almost everything. Different sexual positions, different ways to pleasure yourself, sex toys, you name it. Now that I think of it, I think my cousin is doing all this so he could make me curious enough to ask for sex. But I don&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t. But maybe he passed the curse onto me. Now I want the same exact things he wanted from me when I was little.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t exactly tell my friends about my bisexuality but I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;ve figured that out by now. Hell I&rsquo;ve kissed some of them, drunk or sober, but I&rsquo;ve never really get into a serious relationship with girls. At least not for the past 4 years. But me about being a pedo&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure if a single, breathing, living soul would hear about it.</p>
<p>At first, it was very hard for me. I hated myself. I just wanted to be normal. Looking at a little girl for a few minutes means imagining a hundred ways I could touch, smell and taste her. And every time, it makes my throat dry. My hunger for it is driving me crazy. I sometimes think of snatching a child, do whatever I want with her, and then, kill her. And I was just around 10 that time. I would masturbate thinking about little girls instead of my crushes, male and female, in school.</p>
<p>Then I got smart around my way on the internet. I discovered lolicons. I&rsquo;d spend a lot of time in front of the computer at night browsing pictures and videos and then I&rsquo;d pleasure myself before going to bed. Since then, I thought I could satisfy my burning hunger through that. I was so happy because I thought I didn&rsquo;t even have to trick or hurt someone to get my way. I&rsquo;ve never been so wrong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my mom assigned me to be in our small store to attend the cash register. I thought; what the hell? I have internet in there. Most of the time when I bring my laptop with me, I browse pictures, sometimes I even watch videos and our customers don&rsquo;t have a single clue that there&rsquo;s a tiny, pink, vibrating thing in between the pussy lips of their cashier.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned how not to be so obvious when I cum. My knees still buckle but I know how to suppress my moans. My favorite part is cumming while punching numbers on the register with a customer in front of me. I wonder if they can hear the vibration. I hope not. I know no one knows about it but still&hellip; the thrill&hellip; anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>As most of the days, business is slow around 1-3 pm. Not much customers come in so I figured I&rsquo;d close the store to take a nap or do whatever. My niece came around that time, wearing a white top with a princess print on it and a blue, polka-dotted, balloon skirt I gave her for Christmas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi baby doll, what are you doing here?&rdquo; That exact moment, her young father came in. He&rsquo;s my cousin and he&rsquo;s just like 3 years older than me but he now have two kids. Sophie is his eldest and Angela is two years younger. Both beautiful, beautiful girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heyyah.&rdquo; He greeted me with a salute. &ldquo;Can I leave her to you? Just for an hour or two? Just gotta run some errands&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I have a choice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;d say yes. Where&rsquo;s the other smurf?&rdquo; Sophie giggled. She thought it was silly that I&rsquo;m calling them smurf. She said she isn&rsquo;t blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you could handle both of them&hellip; I left her with someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever. Next time, leave both of them to me. Got nothing to do anyways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Thanks. You&rsquo;re the-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best cousin ever? I know. Now, get lost and leave this little angel to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright. Behave yourself, munchkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a munchkin, but I sure will behave myself.&rdquo; Said the smiling girl.</p>
<p>I guided her behind the counter and pulled out the mat I keep on the cabinet.</p>
<p>Sophie is the type of child who doesn&rsquo;t run out of questions to ask. At first she&rsquo;s ask what do you call something, and then, what&rsquo;s it for, and then, what&rsquo;s it made of. And to be honest, I don&rsquo;t have much patience for those kind of things. Child or adult, I can still get pretty irritated. Well, with a child I sometimes play along but you know, we all have limits.</p>
<p>So to get her quiet, I plugged in my new game controller and started playing an old sega game. My brother decided he wanted to live his childhood life again and asked me to download all our favorite games as children. Chip and Dale, Super Contra, Super Mario, Super Mario 3, Battle City, hell, he even asked for Wrecking Crew and Popeye. I haven&rsquo;t played Joe and Mac for a while so I picked it. She watched me play without saying a single word. Well, actually, she did. She&rsquo;s dropping me a few clues about how much she wanted to play the game but of course I ignored them. I&rsquo;m not letting that kid into my pc. No, no, no.</p>
<p>Then I got tired of it and started playing a movie instead. We watched Tangled and the girl knew the story well. She knew what would happen next, damn, she knew every word in the movie. I wonder how many times she&rsquo;d seen it. But just like a normal kid, she don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>We sat close to each other and just like a child who don&rsquo;t give a damn about their panties showing, she sat with her knees bent, her legs spread wide. She&rsquo;s wearing white panties with pink elastics on the leg holes. There were pink little flowers embroidered all over. Man, she looked so fuckable.</p>
<p>Lucky me, her panties were a little loose on the leg hole. Once in a while, I would take a peek on her smooth, hairless and puffy pussy mound. Suddenly, the movie I&rsquo;ve seen so many times doesn&rsquo;t seem to make any sense. I can&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on. All that I&rsquo;m aware of is that cute, sexy thing beside me. She smelled like strawberry. Probably her shampoo.</p>
<p>I moved a little to angle myself with a better view of her not so hidden treasure. I&rsquo;m not even watching the movie anymore. I&rsquo;m just sitting there, staring.</p>
<p>And then, she slapped her arm and murmured something about mosquitoes. And then, suddenly, a light bulb flashed inside my head. I got a good idea. An excuse to get my hands all over her.</p>
<p>I stood up and pick up an insect repellant lotion from one of the racks and brought it behind the counter. I started applying some on myself when she asked if she can have some too because mosquitoes are biting her. I squeezed some in her palms but of course, she didn&rsquo;t know how to apply it properly.</p>
<p>I got so excited about my plan I thought I&rsquo;m going to have a heart attack. I squeezed some more lotion into my palms and started rubbing it on her arms like I didn&rsquo;t really care while deep inside, all I could imagine is sliding my middle finger in and out of her cunt while she begs for more.</p>
<p>My hands felt so hot touching her. I spread the lotion very slowly just so I could be in my fantasy a little bit longer. And then, I started on her feet going up until I reached her thighs. I feel my heart beat going nuts, I can hear it beating against my chest and my brain&rsquo;s all foggy.</p>
<p>I applied lotion up to her inner thighs and the child didn&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s something strange about the way I touch her. I&rsquo;m kind of squeezing and pinching a bit but she&rsquo;s so focused in the movie. I lifted up her top and started putting lotion in her tummy. I know I didn&rsquo;t have to apply the lotion in there, but she didn&rsquo;t. She even helped me by holding up her top so it wouldn&rsquo;t fall while I&rsquo;m putting lotion.</p>
<p>And then, just to prolong my own agony, I started on her back instead of directly going to her chest. I squeezed and I rubbed there for a few seconds before I finally went for the target. I can&rsquo;t see her chest but I felt those two little nubs where her breast would grow in a few years. I squeezed the lotion on both of my hands and got busy rubbing her. I started focusing on her nipples. With both of my hands, I started making little circles around her nipples using my middle fingers. I don&rsquo;t know if she noticed because she&rsquo;s not saying anything. Unable to restrict myself, I decided I&rsquo;d push my luck and make a go for that sweet, golden treasure under her skirt.</p>
<p>I lifted up her skirt and let my right palm rest on top of her mound. Maybe she didn&rsquo;t thought of it as weird because again, I didn&rsquo;t get a reaction. The only time she looked up at me is when I started pressing and fondling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Kara&hellip; what are you doing?&rdquo; she looked up at me with her huge brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m putting lotion on you.&rdquo; I answered as a matter of fact-ly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my panties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I have to.&rdquo; I touched her mounds again while she watches my hand. It was so erotic. I tried to convince myself that she is inviting me to do it. I can&rsquo;t help it. Me molesting her, and she, just letting me do it.</p>
<p>Deciding what I&rsquo;m doing is normal, she went back to her movie but she couldn&rsquo;t focus especially when I slid two fingers in her leg hole. I took in a deep breath. For so long, I&rsquo;ve fantasize about something like this&hellip; I feel like I&rsquo;m finally being released.</p>
<p>With her eyes focused on what I&rsquo;m doing but she didn&rsquo;t utter a single word. It almost looked like she&rsquo;s afraid. Well, I can get pretty scary when I&rsquo;m angry.</p>
<p>I let my fingers feel that puffy pussy lips of hers. I feel so hot in my cunt I thought about masturbating in front of her even though I know I wouldn&rsquo;t. At least not that time.</p>
<p>I started rubbing along her slit and she just watched with curious eyes. Sometimes she would look up at me but I would just give her a smile. A few minutes of this and I decided that I could go further. We were sitting on the floor and I lifted her up a bit and made her sit on my lap. I spread her knees as wide as they would go. I was about to start going back to my business when I looked up for no apparent reason and I saw a mirror hanging on the wall. Having yet another light bulb flashed inside my head, I stood up and took the mirror. Strangely, the noisy, full of questions child isn&rsquo;t saying anything.</p>
<p>Sitting back down, I put her in the same position she was in before I stood up.</p>
<p>With no warning, I slid my hand under her underwear and let it rest there for a while feeling the warmth of her little girl pussy. I didn&rsquo;t know it could be much, much hotter touching her without removing her clothes. I can feel but I can&rsquo;t see much. It keeps me guessing and it&rsquo;s making more interested.</p>
<p>Using my index and ring finger, I spread her pussy lips apart and let my middle finger in between. At first I just let my middle finger rest in her slit. I need to memorize the feeling so I can fantasize about it later. I started pressing gently and then I moved my finger around in circular motions. I looked in the mirror and to my surprise, she isn&rsquo;t watching anymore. She&rsquo;s leaning against me, her head bent back, her eyes closed and her mouth open. She&rsquo;s drawing in sharp breaths. She is liking it! I never knew a little girl could really feel good about something like that. Are their clits that sensitive already? At that age? I thought it&rsquo;s only in the illustrations and stories.</p>
<p>I pulled out my hand from her little girl pussy and I heard the elastic snap on her skin. I brought my fingers near my nose and god help me because I can&rsquo;t help myself but to put my fingers in my mouth. I sucked on it like a hungry child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; I whispered. She nodded in response and it definitely boosted up my confidence on whatever I&rsquo;m doing. Maybe this is the day my fantasy would come true!</p>
<p>I put my hand inside her underwear again and continued touching her. This time I started licking her neck, her arm or whatever my tongue can touch. She&rsquo;s a little bit salty from sweat but nothing beats the taste of a little girl.</p>
<p>Me, I like being a little rough when I&rsquo;m doing a manual job on myself. I started rubbing her faster, squeezing tighter, and pressing harder. It&rsquo;s impossible that she knew what she&rsquo;s doing so I concluded that her moving her hips upwards so she could grind on my hand harder is a natural response of an individual getting sexually pleasured.</p>
<p>I slipped a finger in her leg hole and played with her sex hole without pushing the finger in. I don&rsquo;t want to break her right there and then. It has to be special for her. Maybe I&rsquo;d bring her home or something.</p>
<p>For a moment there, I forgot it isn&rsquo;t my pussy I&rsquo;m playing with. I got a little too rough. She told me to slow down but I couldn&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t think straight. She told me to stop a few times but she&rsquo;s letting out naughty sounds in between the pleadings. Fondling and squeezing her mounds is driving me insane. I wanted to squeeze her so hard until she screams.</p>
<p>After a couple of minutes of this, she let out a loud moan while she closed her legs tightly. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the girl just reached her climax. I can feel her pussy muscles twitching. Oh my god, this is heaven! I can&rsquo;t explain how I feel. I wanted to jump around the room. But most of all, I wanted to lay her down on the floor, lick that sweet, tight pussy of hers. I actually want to suck and bite it but no, I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It took her a moment before she fell back on my lap. She was breathing heavily and it took her longer to recover. The only time I noticed that her nails dug into my skin was when she released. Also, I got aware of my hands. They&rsquo;re wet. It took me a while to figure out she peed. She just realized it, too and she looked ready to cry out of embarrassment. She stood in front of me, covering her face. I removed her hands away from her face and gave her a light peck on the lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Does it feel good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; Kind of- It felt kind of weird&hellip; strange&hellip; but yeah, I guess it felt good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Come by to my house later. Maybe you could tell your mom you wanted to sleep over? We&rsquo;d do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I might pee again&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t tell anybody. Is it a deal then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okaaay!&rdquo; Sophie wrapped her arms around me tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise me you won&rsquo;t tell your daddy or anyone what we did, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s a secret. And if you tell them, they&rsquo;d know you peed on your panties. They&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;re a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a baby! Angela is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. That&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t tell anybody. You&rsquo;re a big girl now, right? Big girls can keep secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I grabbed a tissue paper and wiped her between her legs. I told her to leave the panties and hurry back home to put on a fresh one without anybody noticing and come back again so she&rsquo;d be here when her dad comes back.</p>
<p>She went out of our store with a smile on her face, skipping happily.</p>
<p>I ran to the bathroom to relieve myself. I had her piss-wet panties on my face while I slid a marker in and out of my cunt. I don&rsquo;t walk around carrying a dildo so I got to improvise. It didn&rsquo;t take me long anyway since I&rsquo;m dripping wet already.</p>
<p>Sophie knocked on the door just right after I put on my jeans. I let the girl in and we resumed our little movie. She sprang up when she heard her father came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy! Can I stay over at Aunt Kara&rsquo;s house tonight? Please&hellip; You&rsquo;ve gotta let me! She has The Little Mermaid. I haven&rsquo;t seen that one yet!&rdquo; Where did that come from? Seriously? Huh. Well I learned to make up stories and lie when I was around four so yeah, I guess it runs in the family&hellip; especially when it has something to do with sex. I heard Sophie&rsquo;s father got busted once peeking on my other cousin while she&rsquo;s in the bathroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can she? Rhea called, she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make it home tonight.&rdquo; Rhea is his partner&hellip; they aren&rsquo;t married so&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she can. We&rsquo;re going to have so much fun.&rdquo; I winked at her and she beamed at me.</p>
<p>Well folks, I guess I&rsquo;m going to be busy tonight.</p>
