  "articleBody": "I was going thru some old boxes and found a pile of old pictures. One made me smile. It’s a hand tinted picture of little girl with rosy cheeks and blond hair taking a huge bite out of a long wedge of pink watermelon. I must have been six or seven and in Mississippi at Poppy’s house. I remember telling my sister to take my picture. We thought it was hilarious. Then I remembered what happened next…\n***\nIt must have been Poppy’s 60th birthday, so I would have been seven. My sister Karen and I lived in Washington, but spent two weeks each summer in Mississippi. One week with Momma’s family, the Jones, and one with Daddy’s, the Pickens. Poppy was momma’s daddy, so were in Florence. There was a big bar-b-q over at his farm. My older sister Karen was running around with an Instamatic taking pictures. We thought our Mississippi cousins were hilarious. I told her “Watch this!” and took a huge bite out of a long wedge of watermelon. I nearly dropped it we laughed so hard.\nMy cousin “Crazy” Eddie was watching from up at the porch. He laughed along with us. After Karen wandered off with her camera, he yelled down at me, “Hey, Cindy, wanna see something in the barn?”\nI put the big piece of watermelon with my bite out of it back on the table and looked around. I had to be careful about Karen. I used to pull my pants down in front of the little boy next door. If Karen saw me do it, she would rat me out and I’d get a spanking. The spanking hurt, but it was worth it. Anyway, Eddie was a couple of years older than me, but we used to play doctor in the barn sometimes, so I said, “Sure.”\nThe barn was really just a big metal shed. Poppy stored his tractor and farm stuff in it. Eddie and I used to play on an old sofa in a storeroom. We played show me yours and I’ll show you mine kinda games. I even gave him a hand job last summer right before I left. That was the first time I ever touched a boys thing. It was fun.\nWhen we got there, we’re not alone. My older cousins Bobby and Mikey were there, too. I looked at Eddie and he just shrugged. I tried to run, but Bobby and Mikey picked me up and threw me onto the sofa.\nI tried to yell, but Bobby hit me across the face, hard.\n“Shut the fuck up, whore,” he said, “or I’ll really hurt you.” He showed me a long switchblade and held it to my throat.\nI nodded and put my hand to my cheek, still shocked. I looked over at Eddie, but he was still by the door, looking a little scared, too.\n“Eddie told us all about you, you little Yankee whore.” Bobby said. “You really like cock? So we decided to give you some more, a lot more.” He pulled out his thing. It was huge! He grabbed my hair, then tried to forced it in my mouth.\nI started to cry and struggle.\n“Stop that, cunt.” He pressed the knife against my throat. “Open your fucking mouth and suck it.”\nI was scared, so I did. It tasted nasty. He grabbed my hair and shoved it deep in my mouth. I didn’t know what he was doing. I got scared and bit down.\nHe yelled and pulled out and hit me again. I curled up on the couch as Bobby screamed “Fucking Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!” with each punch until Mikey grabbed his arm.\n“Shut the fuck up. You want Poppy or Daddy to hear you?”\nThat seemed to sober Bobby a bit. He hit me one more time, quietly, and began to pull my dress off over my head.\nMy nose was bleeding. I tried to grab my dress as Bobby pulled it away from me, but he hit me again. I curled up on the couch and let him undress me.\nNext thing I knew, Bobby pulled me down on the old horse blanket on the dirt floor. He got between my legs. I wondered what he was doing until he shoved his cock between my legs. It hurt like hell and I yelled and tried to get away, but Mike and Eddie held me down and shoved my panties in my mouth. They tasted like pee and I tried to spit them out but Mikey put his hand over my mouth.\nSomething tore down there and I screamed as Bobby plunged deep inside me. I started to cry as he hurt me. He pounded into me over and over until he slammed down real hard and I felt his thing squirt something inside me. I thought he was peeing in me. He pulled out and I saw blood and white stuff all over his thing and got really scared.\n“Goddamn she’s tight!” Billy said as he wiped his thing with his red kerchief.\n“I’m next!” Mikey said and got up to drop his pants. I tried to get away but Eddie pulled me back and threw me down again.\nBobby hit me again and said “Not yet, whore.” I tried to close my legs when Mikey got between them but Bobby hit me twice more “Jesus, girl, you just don’t learn.”\nMikey dropped his pants and his thing was big and hard, too. He shoved it in me down there and it hurt, but not as bad as Bobby’s did. “Goddamn, Bobby, she is tight,” Mikey said as he pounded into me. His thing’s not as big as Bobby, so it just kinda slides in and out easier. It still kinda stings a bit, but not too bad. He doesn’t last too long and soon I feel his thing jerk and spray inside me. Then he gets up off of me and Eddie takes his place.\n“I’m sorry Cindy,” Eddie says as he gets between my legs.\n“What are you apologizing to this cock teasing whore, Eddie?” Bobby says. “Shut up and fuck this slut like she deserves.” Then he punches me again.\nEddie’s thing is the smallest of the three, but bigger than I remember. He’s grown a little hair down there, too, since last year. He lifts my legs and pulls them apart, and slides his thing inside me. It hardly hurts at all this time and he pushes it in and out of me slowly.\n“Hurry up, stupid. It’s almost time for supper.” Bobby says.\nEddie picks up the pace and I almost begin to like it. Under the stinging pain I begin to feel something strange, like that time when my sister Karen plays with me down there. Eddie lets go of my legs and I kind of wrap them around him.\n“See! I told you she’s a whore! She likes it!” Bobby yells.\n“Shh,” says Mickey who is watching from the door, then adds, “Hurry up, Eddie, Nana is putting the food out.”\nEddie goes faster and I look up at him. He says “I’m sorry” again, real quiet, and looks like he’s going to cry. I feel his thing go soft and he stops.\nBobby can’t believe it, and hit’s him upside his head. “Stupid Retard!” he yells and lets go of me. He and Mikey leave, shaking their heads in disgust.\nEddie helps me get dressed as I try to wipe up the blood and goo with my white handkerchief. “I’m sorry, Cindy.” He tells me, “Bobby made me get you, or he’d beat me up.”\nI don’t say anything. I put on panties and they’re wet from being shoved in my mouth, but I don’t care. Outside I hear my mother calling my name. I hear her yelling at Karen for not keeping an eye on me. I am wiping the blood from my nose when she comes in and sees me on the couch with Eddie next to me.\n“What have you done??” she screams, then she hits me, not Eddie! “Look at all this blood on your good dress!” I burst into tears as she grabs me by the arm and pulls me out of the barn and into the house.\nI didn’t get any supper that night and we left for home the next day. I tried to tell Momma what happened but she wouldn’t hear any of it. She said I was making up lies and wouldn’t let me watch TV for the rest of the summer. Karen got grounded for a month, too.\nLater I heard that they put Eddie in reform school cause he was a retard, but nothing happened to Bobby and Mickey. Next year, I didn’t fight them in the barn.\n",

<p>I don&rsquo;t say anything. I put on panties and they&rsquo;re wet from being shoved in my mouth, but I don&rsquo;t care. Outside I hear my mother calling my name. I hear her yelling at Karen for not keeping an eye on me. I am wiping the blood from my nose when she comes in and sees me on the couch with Eddie next to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done??&rdquo; she screams, then she hits me, not Eddie! &ldquo;Look at all this blood on your good dress!&rdquo; I burst into tears as she grabs me by the arm and pulls me out of the barn and into the house.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get any supper that night and we left for home the next day. I tried to tell Momma what happened but she wouldn&rsquo;t hear any of it. She said I was making up lies and wouldn&rsquo;t let me watch TV for the rest of the summer. Karen got grounded for a month, too.</p>
<p>Later I heard that they put Eddie in reform school cause he was a retard, but nothing happened to Bobby and Mickey. Next year, I didn&rsquo;t fight them in the barn.</p>
