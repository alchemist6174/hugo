  "articleBody": "Its Only Money As I crested the other side of the hill, my mobile rang an unknown number on the display.\n“Max Adams”, I answered.\n“Nigel Handrey, Mr Adams, Auspac Private Banking, Sydney” came the cultured tone of a Privately Educated Englishman, through the speaker. That exact moment the signal disappeared, I braked putting the car in reverse, and backed up the hill.\n“Are you there Mr Adams? came a worried Voice through the speaker.\n“Sorry I asked to whom am I speaking?”\n“Nigel Handrey Auspac Private Sir?”\n“What’s it in regards to Mr Handrey?” I inquired.\n“Are you alone sir?” he asked quietly.\n“Yes” I replied\n“It’s regarding the Five Hundred Odd Million dollars in your account Sir?” he replied.\n“Don’t tell me they want it back.”\n“No Sir, Not at all, I’m just ringing to inform you, I have moved it, out of your account,” he said.\n“You’ve Done Fucking What” I yelled all manners and civility gone in a split second.\nA wry chuckle came out from the speaker, “it’s still there, but not there, if that makes sense”, he said continuing before I could go off again, “it’s to stop prying eyes at branch level Sir, I am assigned To You Mr Adams, to facilitate any monetary assistance that you might require” he finished.\n“Oh, that should make it easier then.”\n“Exactly Sir” he said.\n“Bugger” I uttered realizing then about the Cheques I had written earlier.\n“Is there a problem Sir?” he asked.\n“I have written a couple of cheques out of that account,”\n“Oh no problem at all Sir” quoting, the next Two Cheques in my checkbook.\n“For what amount and to who are they issued?” he asked as I rattled of the required information.\n“I’ll get them straight into their Accounts.”\n“Now where is the fun in that?” I said shaking my head and chuckling”.\nAs the sound of an approaching, car came up the hill.\nIt was Klaus Schmitt on his way home, “Hang on Nigel” I said as I hit the mute button.\n“Hi Schultz how’s it going I was just on my way to see you, I’m just on the phone to my personal banker” I said realizing how dumb that statement sounded.\n“Hang on Klaus, Nigel are you still there?” I asked into the speaker.\n“Yes Sir” he replied.\n“Go and get a cuppa I’ll rang you back in Five minutes OK.”\n“Yes Sir I will wait for your call, Thank you” he said while hanging up.\nKlaus looked at me wondering, what in god’s name was going on.\n“The bank took some money from my account and just rang me to let me know” I said .\n“Want a drink buddy? I asked.\n“What have you got” he replied.\n“Zero, Diet, or full strength.”\n“Full one thanks,” he said as I handed it over for him to open.\n“How much did they take out your account, if you don’t mind me asking?” he asked just before he’d taken a mouthful of drink.\n“Five Hundred” I said, “Thousand” he said as his eyebrows rose.\n“No Million” I answered, as a stream of coke came out from his nose and mouth.\n“Bullshit” he said coughing.\n“You should have had the light one Schultzie, you never could handle full strength” I said laughing, “and it’s not Bullshit either.” as he finally regained his composure.\n“Oh” was all he replied. As his wife Anna, and daughter Inga, came up the hill and stopped alongside us.\n“Hello Darling”, she said to Klaus.\n“Hello Max” she said to me, while turning over her shoulder to talk to her daughter slouched in the back seat. “Say Hi to Max, Inga” Inga’s head came up, as she went a deep shade of red, as she saw who it was; her Mother wanted her to say high to. She then, burst into tears, getting out from the car, and running up the driveway into her house.\n“What in heaven’s name was that all about” her father asked first looking at his wife, than at me.\n“Don’t ask me? Anna answered, she’s been acting strange all day” as they both turned to look at me.\n“Buggered If I know, she seemed OK this morning, when I gave her and the kids a lift to school” I said.\n“What kids? Anna asked?”\n“Lauren and Holly, and Louise’s two boys?” I said.\n“Oh said Anna, you know she’s got the biggest crush on you?”\n“Huh” I replied.\n“And you did promise to marry her if she got High Distinctions in her exams?” Anna said laughing.\n“Oh fuck!” was all I could add. I went ashen, at that remembered promise.\nKlaus and Anna both looked at me in stupefied wonder.\nMy mobile rang, talk about saved by the bell, I pressed answer, “Hello Nigel” I said into the mike.\n“Who the Fucks Nigel, said Stephanie out of the speaker.\n“Wait one Fanny” I said using her pet name and put her on mute.\n“Can I see you both up in the house, I said to the Schmitt, I’ve got a business proposition I need to discuss with you, so give me Fifteen OK?” They both nodded as they pulled out into the driveway of their house.\n“What’s up Fanny?” I said back into the phone.\nStephanie came back on to the speakers, “Where are you Lauren needs to talk to you.”\n“I’m up at Schultzie place why” I asked.\n“Hi daddy” Laurens Voice issued into the car, something happened this morning, but I forgot to tell you, in all the excitement” she said.\n“I didn’t know PSD was catching” I replied laughing.\n“Funny” was all she said, chuckling just the same.\n“What did you want to tell me sweetie, I’ve got a meeting with the Schmitt’s.”\n“Oh shit Its about Inga Daddy, she was way weird, when she got out of the car this morning at school, she asked me about 50 questions, about what was going on between you, and Veronica” she said.\n“What did you say to her?” I asked.\n“Not a lot, as I didn’t know a lot, she saw how you and Veronica were looking at each other, and when I said I didn’t Know, she called me a lying Cow, and stormed off in tears to the washrooms. I thought she was going to hit me, she was that upset” said Lauren in one long breath.\n“Thanks for the belated heads up Kiddo” I replied, “I have just been reminded by her Mother, that I promised to marry her If she got Distinctions in her finals.”\n“Oh Fuck” said Lauren, which was turning out to be the statement of choice.\n“I couldn’t have put it any better myself Sweetie” I said laughing back at her,\n“Having money sure do’s ramp up the excitement level,” Lauren replied breaking into laughter herself.\n“How many churches, do you want me to book Maxie, her mother piped up into the phone” causing the ever so resultant laughter.\n“Hang on got to pee” I said opening the door, and peeing down the hill.\n“That’s Better, as I put my penis back away, just as the another call light Lit up, Got to go girls I will ring you back as soon as I can OK bye.”\n“Max Adams, Nigel Handrey” was the answer.\n“Sorry Nigel family dramas, life was just so much easier when I was only just comfortably, wealthy” I said laughing.\n“Define comfortably” said Nigel with a wry chuckle.\n“Exactly,” said I laughing loudly, “God I’ve got two women I promised to marry both upset, with me. Do you want one, I’ll pay you to take them off my hands,” I said laughing even harder.\n“I bat for the other side” Nigel replied laughing.\n“Of Course you do, you’re a bloody pommy,” I said falling onto to the console in hysterics.\n“Quite right” was the laughing rejoinder back from Nigel.\n“I’ve switch a time or too myself “I said, wishing instantly, that I could take that statement back.\n“Well it does improve one’s batting average, Sir” was all Nigel replied.\n“We all need our batting averages improved” I said quietly.\n“Quite right” said Nigel “Now If I may get back to the matter in question Sir. I am your, personal banker Mr Adams, if there is anything that you require in regards to your account. Or related banking matter, please don’t hesitate to call Day or Night, I’m here on call 24 hours a Day.”\n“That wouldn’t leave you much of a social life” I replied.\n“I’d rather not discuss matters of a personal nature Mr Adams If I may” he said.\n“Quite Right, Totally, unprofessional of me Mr Handrey” I said.\n“Mr Handrey is my father Sir; I’m perfectly comfortable with Nigel, Mr Adams.”\n“Sorry Nigel please accept my apology”.\n“No need to Sir, it’s all good, as they say” he replied.\n“Handrey I said you’re not related to Sir Alistair Handrey, are you? If you don’t mind me asking that is,” I added.\n“Not at all Sir, He’s My Father, Do you know Him.”\n“Yes I do as a matter of fact; My Mother is married to his Brother in Law, Sir George Chambers”\n“Really” was all he said.\n“Yes Really, My Mother, is or I should say was, Helen Black.”\n“Oh” was the quite reply.\n“We have met as well I said; I think we might have even had some batting practice, together, if my memory serves.” I said. Remembering a torrid fucking and sucking session out in the Saddle room. While staying at my sister’s property, I’m not gay, but, I have fucked a few who are.\n“If you ever visit up Hasting way Nigel, look me up, you will find my batting technique has greatly improved, since our last practice session.\n“I recall your batting technique was quite OK Max, if you don’t mind me saying” he said.\n“It’s always nice to complimented on ones technique, Nigel, Thank You.”\n“My pleasure” he said.\n“If I remember correctly, the pleasure was Mutual Buddy,” I laughed.\n“Quite” was all he said in Reply.\n“Oh Nigel, Yes Sir” he said.\n“No sirs matey, were family, if you need any money at all, just give me a yell, OK, that’s just the tip of a very big iceberg.”\n“I’m fine, thank you for asking; just how big is this iceberg exactly?” he asked.\n“About 20,000 tons give or take,” I said.\n“Shit that Big” he said.\n“Yep and that’s, not the only Iceberg, but they don’t know that, OK”.\n“OK Max, Discretion is my middle name” he laughed.\n“I thought it was Winston”.\n“You always were a funny bugger Max”.\n“I try Nigel, I Try, Seriously Nigel, I Know your Family has had some financial dramas, and just let me know how much, if any you need, OK Buddy”.\n“I’ll let my father know He won’t accept charity I know that much for certain”. He said.\n“OK how about a loan no interest, payable when ever, just so he can get back on his feet, and fix the family ruin up like it deserves. Run that by him Nigel OK, I have got to go, I’m being paged”. Klaus and Anna were on the balcony waving at me.\n“Bye Matt.”\n“Bye Nigel” I replied as I hung up.\nI drove up to the house saying to Klaus and Anne as I got out of the car. “Sorry about that, Banker wankers; you know what they are like, Now where’s my Fianc�?” I asked them both as we walked inside.\n“She’s in her room with the door locked, crying her eyes out” said Anna.\n“It must be my day for crying females, I said or is it that time of the year?”\n“Or month” said Klaus earning himself a dirty look from Anna.\n“Inky Open the Door, sweetheart, Max is here to talk said Anna gently.\n“Go away, I hate you all” was what we got back through the door in reply. Anna tearing up shrugged her shoulders in resignation.\n“Let me have a crack at her” I said kissing Anna gently on the Cheek. OK she replied.\n“Open this Fucking Door, you Big arsed, Saggy Titied, House Cow, before I kick it in up your ass” I yelled Klaus and Anna stood in stunned silence, “it’s all in the delivery”, I said as Inga unlocked and opened the door.\n“Thank you my darling,” I said gently, as she sobbed into my chest. “What’s the problem, can’t find a church you like, Not sure what music to play” I smiled as I kissed away her tears.\n“You are just such a shit” she laughed while hitting me on the chest.\nI grabbed her face in both hands and kissed her hard, my tongue right down to her socks. I let her come up for air I looked at her face and kissed her again, gently “Better” I said.\n“Much” she said kissing and hugging me.\n“Come on” I said leading her into the bathroom to freshen her up, Giving her a damp washer.\nI said, “You look even uglier than usual, looking like that.”\nShe wiped her face and threw the washer at me “Do not” she said.\n“Do to” I said back to her.\n“You said I was Beautiful, So there” sticking out her tongue.\n“When” I said.\n“At the Nationals” she replied fixing her hair in the mirror.\n‘Was there alcohol involved?” I asked knowing it was.\n“Yes” she said,\n“Doesn’t count, any statement made, that’s effected by an alcoholic beverage is null and void” I said looking at Klaus and winking. “Ask your Dad if you don’t believe Me.” she looked at her father who was nodding his head.\n“I’m right” I said as she started to tear up again.\nI walked up to her and kissed her once again. Looking at her saying “Am I Drinking.”\n“No” she smiled.\nI kissed her again, “Your Beautiful and I love you, Now do a, wee and join us in the kitchen OK”.\n“OK Maxie” she said smiling.\nI ushered her parents out the room, as she sat on the toilet, her mother all the Time shaking her head, and muttering. “How in heavens name do you do that” she said still shaking her head.\n“It’s a Gift” I replied Sitting on a chair in the meals area.\nAs Inga walked in and before she sat on my lap, I asked her “Inky could you get your dads big aerial map and a china graph pencil for me please darling.”\n“Do you need a boner, cushion?” she said smiling at me.\n“No I think we can forgo them now.” I replied laughing.\n“A what cushion” her mother said, As Inga curled up into my lap, moulding her body into mine.\n“A boner cushion, so Max didn’t, you know get a hard on if we were sitting on his lap” she said demonstrating it.\n“I’m glad I didn’t know that while you were coaching her at surf rescue” Anna said.\nInga started laughing at her mother “we used to do it deliberately, to rev him up” she said wriggling in my lap. Inga put her hand between her legs feeling my half hard prick.“Yep still got it” she laughed wriggling even more.\n“Stop it or it will poke your eye out Miss.”\n“Promises, Promises” she said laughing.\nBoth her parents had stopped to stare at us both.\n“OK I said” getting back to the elephant in the room. “What’s the problem with you Inky, what do you want to know” I said looking at her. I could feel her tense up at the question.\n“I saw you looking at Veronica Masters, as you drove us all to school, you looked as if you were both ready to fuck each others brains out?” she said. ‘Yep we sure did, she dam near killed me, the little bugger, God what a trip” I added.\n“Are you in love with her” said Inga. I could feel her getting ready to go.\n“Desperately, madly, passionately” I said, Holding Inga to my chest, I could feel her tears on my arm.\n“When, How” she whispered, looking at me, tears streaming down her face.\n“This Morning, at breakfast” I said.\n‘How long have you been in love with her?” Inga asked. Not wanting to know the answer.\n‘This morning, while at breakfast?” I answered.\n“She’s not even sixteen yet, Max for Christ sake, she’s a child, and she couldn’t possibly know about love,” Anna said with all the moral indignation only a mother can muster.\nI looked first at Inga, “how long have you been in love with me my darling,” I asked her, kissing her cheek.\n“Since I was 8 nearly 9” she said.\n“Has that changed since then?”\n“No she said, I love you even more now, than I did then.”\nThat’s good ‘Same for me Inky Pinkie Poo” I said tickling her under the arm.\n‘You do\" she said eyes wide.\n“And as for you, you hypocritical old house Frau, I distinctly remember a drunken conversation about a 15 year old school girl wagging class, so she could go and fuck the brains out of her 25 year old boy friend.”\nAnd looking at the result, it didn’t turn out so bad now, Did it!\"\nI could see Anna getting ready to let me have it with both barrels.\n“There is a vast difference in your ages, are they going to be on some fucking roster at your pleasure, and besides, you just said how madly in love you are, with Veronica. And furthermore, what’s Inga suppose to do, play second fiddle to some bastard, and as for money, what are going to do about that, magically pull it out of your arse” she yelled.\nAnna bought tanks, and artillery.\nMe I went for nuclear, typical German starting something they just cannot win.\n“All valid, but all crap, Jesus Anna I love you, but if your head was any further up your arse you’d disappear. Wait one minute,” I said halting the attack on Berlin, and we all know how that turned out.\n“OK Anna 4 points, 4 answers”!\n“Inga you came second at the National under twelves, are you going to give that medal back.”\n“Fuck, no Way” she said, and realized where I was going.\n“Anna point 2 is for you; your father is how many years older than your Mother?”\n“33 years” she replied.\n“And that relationship sure went to shit didn’t it”. The said couple had just celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary. “In addition, you’re the eldest of 6 children. Correct.”\nThat’s 2 Nil!\n“And as for my Fiance being a bastard, birds of a feather flock together, not being told, and not knowing are two entirely different questions. I think you would agree with that statement, my darling,” I said looking over at Veronica, and her Mother standing in the doorway listening.\n“And Inga Will you hop up for a second and pull my bank account from out of my arse”, I said Miming said action. “What’s this amount, $20 Billion, you heard it here first folks”. All mouths dropped, except for Veronica s, That’s a 20, with how many zeros, that’s a 9 folks\". I replied before finishing with.\n“I think that’s 4 nil. And for the roster, my poor dear old Mother in Law to be”, I said. Getting up to hug and kiss Anna, “That is freaking brilliant idea; it’s the only rest I’m ever going to get. As these two will no doubt try, and fuck me into an early demise. That’s game don’t you think”. I said picking up a biscuit and kissing Anna at the same time.\n“Sorry” she said hugging me.\n“It’s all good Anna”.\n“Max Adams”, I said introducing myself, “you must be Veronica’s mother, Robin?”\n“How did you know that?” she asked.\n“Your eyes are crossed just like your Daughters” I replied stepping back.\nAs first Veronica, then Inga collapsed with hysterical laughter.\n“It’s a question. Whether I should kiss you or kill you for molesting my underage daughter,” Robin replied, standing with hands on her hips.\n“Kiss I think, you will find the molesting was fairly evenly distributed wasn’t, it Moo?” I asked looking at Veronica.\n“Pretty much even” Veronica she said, “I think I owe you one” does that count as brownie point Maxie.\n“No my darling, that’s a Brown eye point” I quipped as again liquid; in this case coffee came out Klaus nose.\n“Do you need, a Sippy mug, Klaus?” I asked which earned me the little known, German one finger salute.\n“While we are on the subject of Molesting, Max”, said Anna.\n“Goody you want to molest me, Oh yes please Mummy” I laughed.\n“No Max, seriously it’s about Inga” she said in a concerned tone.\n‘You want me to seriously, molest Inga, Anna Oh Goody.\"\n“Max, be serious for once, please” she said.\n“Sorry Anna, Darling Number Two could you come her please” I asked looking at Inga.\n“Anna, Klaus over here, please” I said to them “Still there”, I whispered to Inga.\n“Yep”, she nodded, as I lifted her skirt and lowered her panties past her bottom down to her knees. They had now fallen down to her ankles, as she lifted her Right leg to step out of them, her mound and vulva in all its beauty came on display.\nInga’s snatch and her vulva were there for all to see. Only one word could describe it, perfect. Shape, perfect, Form once again perfect, Colour perfect again. Whoever was in charge of pussy assembly, on the day Inga arrived, deserved a gold medal. Moreover, the great thing about it, it was all mine.\nI wet my right index finger and ran it up the folds of her labia. Once it was fully wet, I eased it gently into her vaginal canal. It stopped, I removed my finger from her as she sighed and shivered, and I licked it clean. Wow the taste was unbelievable. I grabbed her Mothers right hand and sucking on her index feature, inserted that until it stopped, pulled it out and licked it clean.\nI repeated the same procedure for Klaus. Inga by this time was gibbering wreck on the verge of collapse. My trusty sidekick Veronica came to her rescue, kissing her, while gently lowering Inga onto to the rug.\n“What we have here Ladies and Gentlemen, Is probably the only 17 year old virgin left in Hastings shire. Molested, I don’t think so, preserved, and protected while all the time saving her from the pimpled Girl ravaging, beasts, out there on the savannah” I said looking at Klaus and Anna, who were in tears.\n“I deserve a bloody medal,” I added, While giving both of them a kiss.\n“You have no idea how hard it was, both in the literal and physical sense, not to throw her over a pile of surf gear and fuck her senseless for a month of Sundays” I said to them both.\nVeronica by this time was administering her own type of care, kissing and nibbling Inga, over her eyes, ears lips and neck. She was running her hand over Inga’s breasts. Once again prefect, two perfectly sized 36 Inch Boobs the Size and diameter of a rock-melon cut in half.\nVeronica was running the flat of her hand over Inga s raised mound gently rubbing her clit. I was enjoying the show eating a biscuit, Klaus was holding Anna, nuzzling and biting on her neck.\nI beckoned Robin over, over to me, as she was standing squirming rubbing her thighs together watching as well. Veronica had inserted a finger into Inga’s pussy causing Inga to shudder and moan even more than she been previously.\nI had one arm around Robin massaging her left breast, while eating another biscuit.\nVeronica announced “Cookies”. After first, smelling, and then tasting Inga.\n“Biscuits” I said, laughing.\n“You are such a dick Max Adams, Veronica laughed, Inga smells of cookies”.\n“Oh I said”. As I nuzzled into Robins neck while running my hand up her thigh to her pussy, and getting a sample of my own, as both girls watched on from the floor.\nI sampled the aroma of Robin’s pussy, and juices as well. I kissed her on the neck and ear saying to Veronica “Cookies here too, as well as melons”. After putting my left hand back on Robin’s gloriously full rock-melon sized breast.\nShe moaned and leaned back into me saying “Cookies, what all the drama about cookies?”\nI replied “I’m more interested in the melons at the moment” as I rubbed her left nipple between my fingers.\n“God that feels so good, it’s been so long,” she moaned. Robin was rubbing her own pussy with her right hand.\nMy penis by this stage had gained full hardness and was rubbing on the crease of her arse between her thighs that felt good too.\n“Max get down here and make love, to Inga before I rip your prick of and feed it to Charlie Dog,” Veronica said angrily. Then more calmly “Maxie please Inky been wanting you to fuck her since she was nine,” Said Veronica.\n“Please Max I want you to make love to me so badly, I’ve waited so long” pleaded Inga.\n“Duty calls I must away” I said putting Robin’s breast back in her bra, with her nipple sitting up like a flagpole. Robin sat down.\n“Mummy you can keep Maxie hard for Inga, come on, she really needs him, please mum” in best kid whiny voice you know the one I mean?\n“Yes Mum start earning your keep” as I helped her back up from of the Chair, I untied my drawstring to drop my pants.\nAs my prick came into full view as I stepped out my clothes, after lowering my pants and jocks.\nVeronica said to Inga “look Inky isn’t it beautiful, it’s so pretty” exactly want a feller wants to hear, Not! Handsome, majestic, awesome pick one, but not pretty.\nI was looking down at the scene on the rug before me; Veronica in her now favourite position, Inga snuggled in her arms, gently massaging her clit and pussy. all the time kissing her on the neck. The girl was a bloody marvel.\n“Would you like this gift wrapped,” I said to them both, they laughed.\n“You’re a dick” said Veronica, “Ditto” said Inga.\n“But we love you, they chorused.”\n“What, for this” I said, waving my penis like a conductors baton.\n“Don’t poke Mums eye out” said Veronica laughing along with Inga. Robin on her knees was trying to latch hold of it, as it swung past her face.\nThe girls both looked at each other, “Nah your money” they answered, and then cracked up in laughter.\n“I’ll have this then,” said Robin finally grabbing hold of my penis, and putting into her mouth. “Yum” she said, mouth full of hard, hot cock. She rolled her tongue around the head of my prick. Massaging it with her lips, it felt wonderful.\n“You’ve done that before”, I said Looking down at her.\n“Lots” was all she said.\n“Mum um!” Veronica said her voice rising in panic, “don’t you make Max go of” as she gave Inga another small orgasm with her fingers. Inga just laid their covered in sheen of sweat, glowing. Wowser!\nI removed my prick from Robin’s oral assault, kissing her hard, saying thank you as I knelt down.\nI was worried what to say in case I caused any stress, to anybody, especially Veronica. I need not have worried.\nSensing my distress she said “My god Inky you are just so beautiful, no wonder Max loves you, promise you’ll share him with me” as her tears flowed down on to Inga’s chest.\n“You silly little bitch” said Inga before kissing Veronica, then adding “I was going to ask you the same question silly” both hugging each other in affirmation.\nMe I just proceeded to feast on Inga dripping pussy. Like Homer Simpson in an all, you can eat buffet. She was just a river of girl slime. When I had let her calm down, I rubbed my prick through her juices. Placing the head of my prick into her canal and said “ready Baby”.\n“Ready” she replied.\nI shoved and I shoved hard. She squealed in pain as I jammed in six inches all in one go. Now why would I do that to someone I loved you ask. Two reasons really. One, Inga, superbly fit, near Olympic standard, Ripped and lean.\nTwo she had the highest threshold to pain of any person I had ever trained, man or women.\nAs the girls looked on in horror at what I had done.\nI backed out two fed in Four.\nBacked out six fed in eight, right to the base “you OK baby” I asked Inga.\nVeronica meantime, had buried her face into in Mothers dripping snatch and was beavering away for all she was worth.\nShe saw her parents looking concerned for her that dissipated in an instant with, “you are so full of shit Mama, we should have done this years ago, Maxie”.\n“Maxie”, she said.\n“Yea baby.”\n“Fuck me really hard OK, I need you in me, now” she sighed.\nMe I always like to keep my customers Happy so I switched into top gear and gave it to Inky, Hard.\nSeven and a half in and out full steam ahead I could feel her starting to cum so I got Veronica to drop what she was doing and Keep Inky Wet, Really wet.\nVeronica stopped chewing on Robins snatch and shoveled the fluids, from her own dripping cunt onto Inga’s snatch and my prick. That worked a treat especially when she squatted over Inga, and dribbled on her face and breasts, whoever said making love should be private needed to get out more.\nInga came, not, with a bang, in one rolling wave.\nInga was giving birth, not trying to get pregnant.\nWe had been going hard at it for over ten minutes when Inga’s orgasmic contractions plateau and she finally came.\nHere stomach and Vaginal muscles contracting, tight, painfully, really painfully tight around my Prick.\nI felt as I f someone had put it in a blender. Luckily Robin saw how I was, and started attacking Inga’s clit like a dog with a bone sucking chewing and licking.\nRobin looked down at my balls, and saw they had gone blue,\" Jesus Max they’ve gone blue,\" she said.\n“Really” I whimpered.\nAs Inga finally, eased off. And I was able to drive my prick hard into her canal. Inga was chanting in rhythm with our fucking, “baby, I want a baby Max, give me your baby” repeatedly.\nRobin looked at me “can you cum.”\nI squeaked, “Help now, arse”.\nShe wet her fingers to massage my prostate, “god you’re a wreck” when she saw the condition of my anal ring, she gently massaged it in and I came not with a bang, but a whimper. Both Inga and I were fucked, physically and literally.\n“You OK baby” I asked Inga as I finally pulled out, I was still three quarters hard, I kissed Veronica and Inga as I lay on my back, prick straight in the air, I motioned to Robin “Hop on Robbie” I said. Veronica pushed her out of the road, “with its mine bitch.\nI grabbed her before she hopped on. “It’s actually mine, and sit on it Robbie, if you like”\n“OK” Robin said lowering her leg over and sitting down. Sighing, “That feels so good”.\n“It’s a reward for services rendered,” I said.\nAt that moment, Inga barked at her mother “get me a chux quick, a clean one hurry”.\nAnna was just about to say something, saw the shake of my head and passed Inga the chux, which, she tore in half, stuffing it into her cunt with her legs in the air grunting, “Get in get in.”\nA voice came from the opening door “now that’s a sight you don’t see every day, need a hand Sis.”\nWillie, Inga’s older brother walked over, and Inga’s older sister Helena following behind, as Willie folding the chux wedged it into Inga’s cum filled snatch.\n“That should hold it for you,” he said. Before looking around saying, “what in fucks name is going on?”\nAnna predictably was about to go off, when she saw me shake my head, yet again.\nRobin was just about to hop of my still semi hard prick; I said “just spin around Robbie” as I sat, with my back against the lounge legs bent, supporting Robin.\nI looked at Veronica, sitting still, along Inga, “Veronica you here, nodding to my right, Inga you here nodding to my left”. They both moved quickly at the tone in my Voice.\nI looked at Willie, “you there, pointing, Helena, there, pointing opposite, Now”.\nOK as calm restored, Anna asked, “Would anybody like a drink?”\nNodding, “please I’m dying of thirst?”\n“Coming right up” said Anna.\n“How are you?” I asked the new arrivals.\n“Well, were, good” they answered as drinks were handed out.\n“Klaus Twenty won’t be enough to buy this place will it asked him.”\n“No buddy, even you don’t have enough to buy it.”\n“So how about I lease it, Happy with ten, as a nice round number.”\n“OK” said Klaus looking at Anna, was all that was needed to seal the deal.\n“Right, here the News, It’s the Golden Rule, I said, I’ve got the gold, and I Fucking Rule is that clear enough.”\nLooking at the junior members, “I’m waiting.”\n“Yes Max” they answered.\n“Good that’s squared away”.\nI looked at them all in the face, my eyes burning, they all, even Veronica knew that look.\n“If anybody and I mean anybody, ever talks to their Parents in that way again in my presence.\nI will grab them by the scruff of the neck, tie them over a bench and I will have ten, no make that twenty mangy dogs fuck them up the arse, in public, are we clear on that”.\n“Waiting” I said.\n“Yes Max, sorry Mummy, sorry Dad, Was the chorus from them.\n“Good”.\n“A tad extreme, said Anna I thought ten would have done”.\n“Does anybody want something to eat” as she looked the aftermath of the Orgy. As we all, cracked up in laughter.\n“Love you,” I said to my Girls.\n“Love you too Max” as they both Kissed Robin and I.\n“Care to join my Merry band of minstrels I asked Robin”, as I hugged her to my chest and kissed her on the neck and face, blowing Raspberries’.\n“What” she said laughing and moving around on my prick, giving herself little orgasm, in the process?\n“Better?” I asked, as she settled down.\n“What, you want me to join in with this lot. Why?” she asked.\n“Well it would be nice to have someone nearer to my own age, to help me with my knitting in my dotage”. “Have a couple more Kids, That’s if you want more Kids, this one turned out OK”, I said hugging Veronica”.\n“Oh Id pay you, say 10 each or there about”.\n“You’d pay me 10 thousand dollars to have your Kids” she answered amazement in her voice.\n“They would be your kids as well”. I said\n“Mum, Mum” called Veronica.\n“What” said Robin?\n“That’s the M word, not the T word, Mum”. Veronica replied.\n“The M word Oh, million, you’d pay $10 Million dollars for each child Id have” she said in shock.\n“What it’s not enough, I said hugging her “OK make it 15 them.”\nWillie piped up. “Book me in for Two Max” which set us all off again.\n“What is going on here said Willie, Are we on a TV reality series”\n“Yea it’s called the Young and the Horny” said Veronica looking at Inga.\nAs they both as usual, fell about on the rug in hysterics.\n“Have we got a warm towel handy folks?” Asked Robin\nAs she was just about to stand up of my prick, “you’re not leaving are you”\n“Nature calls” she laughed.\n“OK Girly Stuff. Hope its big Towel” I said deadpan.\n“You are such a Dick,” she said laughing.\n“You know about that now” said Veronica.\nMaking Robin and I both laugh.\n“Behave, or your mother will ruin another rug, I wondered where you, got it from”\n“What” said Robin looking at us both?\n“Max and I have ruined three rugs today?” Veronica replied.\n“How?” asked Robin.\n“How do you think Mum?” said Veronica shaking her head.\n“Oh” she giggled no wonder you look like a train wreck” said Robin as the towels arrived along with a warm washer.\nRobins pussy made a Pop as she stood up, removing my prick.\n“Thank you kind sir” she said curtsying.\nI laughed saying “you’re welcome, Madame”\n“It should be made law that you have to make love, to your mother in law”. I said looking at Anna.\n“Good luck in getting that Max” laughed Klaus.\n“Anytime you’d like too Max let me know” said Anna.\n“OK Anna, it’s a date” I replied, wiping the smile of Klaus’s face.\n“Why would you want to, with your entire new Harem” Anna said quietly.\nI finished cleaning myself, standing up, wrapped the towel around my waist, and kissed Anna passionately, while sticking two fingers up into her still moist Cunt, massaging it, till she came on my hand. I hugged her as she finished cumming, looking at Klaus, over her head, giving him a wink.\n“That’s why, because your daughter is a carbon copy of you?” “And I love you all to bits. I said kissing her again.\nNow where’s dinner you old Frau, I said smacking her on the bum with the towel that had fallen off on to floor.\n“Jesus Max” she said looking at my prick.\nShe walked over and put in into her hand, “Christ, will you look at it, it’s blue, what in gods name did you do to him Inga?”\nThey all came to have a look, Robin held up to look underneath.\nAs I said to Veronica, “did you bring your book of tickets?” with all looking and laughing.\nInga had tears in her eyes “I’m so sorry Maxie”\n“I just wasn’t you Inky,” I said looking over at Veronica.\n“Poor little Max, has taken quite a beating today” I laughed.\n“Dished it out as well,” said Veronica walking towards me legs wide apart.\n“God I love you, you are so bloody funny,” I said tearing up.\n“Sexy too” said Veronica.\nAnna came out from the bathroom holding a tube of ointment. “This should help” as she massaged it in.\nWith the result that it started to go hard, “that is working”, I said.\n“Behave yourself”, said Anna laughing.\n“Hey Klaus, give little Klaus a couple of hits with the meat mallet, if you want to know how it feels,”\n“Ahh this feels good.” Thanks Anna\n“It would take more than a couple, said Willie to put a bruise on dads”.\n“It looked like you were giving it a good work out anyway”, they all looked at me, wondering what I meant.\n“Oh you lot didn’t notice as Inga was attempting to chop my prick of with her pussy. Your father was giving your mother the rounds of the kitchen. I thought he was going to put your Mum through the wall”.\nI looked at Anna, before kissing her again. Robin picked up the tube looking at the instructions.\n“OK this might work”. She spread it onto my bruised anal ring. It stung, and then started to feel better.\n“Better” said Robin.\n“Much, thanks, does this mean were engaged?” I asked.\nShe kissed me “Yep book me in for a couple” she said and kissed me again.\n“What Miss”, she said looking at Veronica you’re the only person who falls in love at first sight.\n“Oh I said it’s not my money then?” I asked Robin.\n“OK the money is a factor, but it’s mainly the Man” she said Hugging Veronica, and kissing me again.\n“Madam, here did a good job of selling your good points to me, after I gave her the third degree as to why she wasn’t in class today” said Robin.\n“How did you know she wasn’t in class?” I asked.\n“The school sent me a text, saying she was absent”\n“Ouch, technology that sure will take the fun out of it” I said.\n“And she’s covered in hickies, and smells like a knock shop.” She smiled.\n“Mum was really, really pissed” said Veronica.\n“I can’t for the life of me think why” I deadpanned. “It’s not like I let you smoke, or heaven forbid, drink, all I have done is guide you down the path of carnal lust and debauchery, just adding to your education, so to speak.” I said\n“Adding to her education, is that what they are calling it now days”, said Robin.\n“Just a couple of chapters” I said defending myself.\n“More like the whole, fucking book, plus the sequel” said Robin.\n“My Road to Rack and Ruin, I’m calling it” said Veronica hugging Inga.\n“I know I know added Inga “How to Fuck a Man to Death and Come away with Billions” with the resulting laughter at my expense.\n“Enough, Moo doesn’t need any more encouragement thank you, Inky, that’s my job” I said before it became a competition at my expense.\n“You were saying my darling” looking at Robin.\n“Ah yes, smelling of sex, I asked the usual questions, the Who, What, When and where, Veronica said we had met.”\n“Ah Melons” I said.\n“Yes melons, said Robin at least she had good taste, you do have a certain reputation you know Max”\n“Do I?” I asked dreading the answer.\n“Yes you do, Karen Saunders gave me chapter and verse about you after the melon episode” said Robin.\n“What’s all this melon business about” interrupted Anna.\n“Max commented on the quality of my Melons” Said Robin.\n“And quite nice melons they are too” said Klaus.\n“How does Tuesday work for you Max, so you can come over, and fuck me senseless” said Anna looking at Klaus.\n“Tuesday should be fine, just let me check with the girls, are you all OK with Tuesday.”\nAll three of them nodded, and said “Tuesdays fine, with Inga adding you are going to love it Mum” adding to Klaus ever increasing stress level.\n“Good said Anna, sorry for the interruption.”\nI looked at Klaus and winked, he smiled back.\n“Where was I said Robin Ah your reputation, Karen was,”\n“Sorry, Robin, if Karen Saunders said anything about me, she is talking through her arse anyone who made love to Karen Saunders, is too fucking lazy to masturbate” I said.\nWith Klaus, once again emitting drink out of his nose.\n“Sorry Klaus let me know when you’re drinking right”\n“Sorry, Robin, you were saying, Reputation?”\n“Ah yes, Checking from more reliable sources other than poor Karen, you have made a lot of friends, that speak very highly of you” “And also of your good works in the community, that largely go unsung, which is unusual in its self.”\n“Experiencing, being let astray and being badly letdown myself, by an older man. I was as you could imagine not that happy that history might repeat itself. Veronica informed me that she was equally involved in what went on. And seeing her depth of feeling for you led me here, to ask what your intentions were regarding Veronica?” She said finishing her story.\n“My intentions, my good woman are totally dishonorable. I fully intend as I said earlier, to further add to her education in the carnal pursuits, which I am hoping in the fullness of time, she will be able to educate me. She appears to be a willing student. I was thinking of adding a Dog and Pony act, even maybe a circus. Care to join us” I said smiling and kissing first Robin, then Veronica in turn.\nWith Inga adding “I’ve always wanted a Pony”. Hugging and kissing the three of us.\n“You still In” I said looking at Robin.\n“For Life” she said tearing up and kissing me.\n“Me two, said Veronica, Me Three, said Inga, Me Four piped up Anna from the kitchen. Me five said Klaus.” The resulting laughter, echoing around the room.\n“And what about you two, in the cheap seats” I said looking at Willie and Helena, care to join my traveling band of miscreants.”\n“What’s in it for me?” asked Willie smiling.\n“How doe’s 5 mill each for a start sound,” I said.\n“You’re going to give us each 5 million dollars, for doing what” she asked, well she was like her mother.\n“You speak how many languages’ exactly, I asked Helena.\n“Three fluently, German, French and Engrish she laughed, pretty good Italian and Spanish, Why?”\n“You have how long to go before you finish your degree in Business Management?” I inquired.\n“If I work my arse off six months or nine if I take it easy?” she asked “Why.”\n“What about your geology electives?” said her mother?\n“Geology electives I inquired, since when”\n“Since I went out on field expeditions with the geology class, looking for Dinosaur Fossils, I really loved it and I already had three quarter of the units covered in Business Studies.” She said.\nMe I was still trying work my head around the tie in between Business Studies and Geology.\nHelena could see my perplexed expression.\n“It’s all Multi Units Now Max it’s all connected. You have your Base units and you then add your electives to complete your degree, It’s Called Integrated Streaming”. She said.\n“Integrated what the fuck do I know, me I just found a shit load of Molybdenum and sold it for a gazillion dollars”.\n“How big, was the find?” asked Helena.\n“An area about twice the size of Hastings” I answered.\n“Fucking hell”, how much?” She asked.\n“54 Bill It’s a joint venture, us and the Chinese.”\n“Ah I see, Chinese, No wonder your happy they will be needing tons and tons of It” she said looking over at us “Sorry steel, Computers, there is some talk of superconductors as well, It was in one my science journals.”\n“You and Steve, would get on like a house on fire” I said\n“Dinners ready” Anna called from the kitchen, you can carry that on in here” she said.\n“You certainly carried on” I said.\n“Do tell don’t hold back” was the chorus of voices.\n“Your Parents were tearing the Kitchen to pieces, the old feller here, I said looking at Klaus, was literally fucking your Mum towards next Christmas.”\n“Glad to see the old folks having fun” said Willie, to laughter all-round.\n“You might want to look on next time there’s a show, and no tickets from you Moo, you will defiantly learn something”\n“What did you learn?” he said.\n“A gentleman never discusses such things, though I might add your mother is very flexible,” I said looking at Anna.\n“Add in Thursday as well if you have time of course,” she said.\nI looked at my Girls, “Thursdays Good” as they stuffed their faces with food.\nKlaus looked at me and said “Be Gentle.”\nAs I looked at Anna “you heard the man please be gentle with me?”\n“I promise,” she laughed.\nMy mobile started ringing it was Stephanie,“Hi Fanny what’s up, I said Hang on, you’re on speaker there you go, what’s happening Kiddo.”\n“Brian checked the account and the moneys already in there how in God’s name did you do that, we still have the cheque.”\n“Not God. Nigel. He’s my finance manager. You’re dealing with the super wealthy now, darling not the merely comfortable peasantry like yourselves.” Using on my best fake pommy accent.\n“You are such a shit, she said laughing, and Brian was so looking forward into handing over the cheque and seeing their faces”\n“Ah but how much betters the result, when you go to the bank, dressed to the nines to close the account. I said. The laughter said it all “You are truly evil Max Adams.”\n“I try” I replied smiling.\n“How’s Inga, is she OK.”\n“I think the question should be am I OK, Inga Is fine, at present she stuffing half the food in the district in her plate as per usual.”\n“I’m a growing girl, Aunty Stephanie, it’s all wonderful Max declared his undying love and I fucked him senseless a good result all-round I’d say.\n“You did what, Max how many now you have collected.”\n“That would be Three,” I said.\n“Whose is the third?” she asked.\n“Robin” I said Veronica s Mother.\n“Ah” said Stephanie, “Hi Buddy”, Brian said in the Background.\n“Robin with the Melons” she said.\n‘Yes Robin with the Melons’ said Robin, sounding not too happy.\n“And you are?” she asked.\n“Sorry my bad, Robin with the Melons, meet Stephanie with the Hole” I said with the ever oh so predictable result from Stephanie.\n“Max Adams you an unmitigated shit of the first order” Stephanie yelled.\n“Bitch Fight” chorused Brian, you still selling Tickets Veronica,” he said laughing.\n“Tickets get your tickets, next show starting soon,” said Veronica as per script, God it was a laugh a minute.\nRobin said contritely to Stephanie “Robin here, Stephanie you are so right about Max, I was going to ring his neck for corrupting my poor little girl, bit I thought no bugger that, I’ll join them and spend all his Money.”\n“I think you and I need to catch up and have a drink and compare notes, As for your little girl, I think the corrupting was fairly evenly shared from what I’ve been told” she said as all eyes looked Veronica.\n“How so?” asked Robin.\n“Let’s just say she covers all bases, animal, I’m not sure about Mineral or vegetable, she keeps her options open so to speak” said Stephanie.\n“Ah said Robin, Max did mention a dog and pony show” as Veronica blushed crimson.\n“Well he will only need the pony then, he’s got the Dog already.”\n“Oh” was the reply.\n“Quite so” said Stephanie as she gave her mobile number to Robin.\n“You there Max, you seem quite for a change.”\n“No all good I was just wondering whether to get another Dog, I really wouldn’t want to put too much strain on me old Charlie Dog.” As I put more chicken salad on my plate. Sometimes you just can’t worry too much.\nAfter Stephanie stopped laughing, she added, “Glen Taylor was in the Bistro today big noting as usual, about some big land deal he’s doing with the MacKinnons out at the Five Mile.”\n“Thanks Stephi Got to go” cutting her of.\nKlaus and I looked at each other “Fuck” we said, the universal adjective that fits any occasion.\n“Dam Fuck and Dam” I added covering all bases.\nI stood up and moved into the lounge carrying the aerial map of the Five Mile. “Your here” I said to Klaus as I marked the area with the pencil “MacKinnons are here.”\n“And there as well, they have two titles” said Klaus pointing to the other side of the river.\n‘That parcel they bought from Barney Reynolds,” I added.\n“Yep” said Klaus.\n“Barney’s property borders both sides of the river and up to National Park doesn’t it” I asked, handing him pencil so Klaus could mark it out. “How big an area you reckon including yours”.\n“At a guess I’d say Nineteen Hundred to Two Thousand give or Take?” why\n“Enough room for a house” I asked as the girls filed in to see what was going on.\n“It would be a tight squeeze, but yea you could fit a house on their” Klaus shook his head laughing.\nThe girls looked at the area we had marked out “Jesus, Anna said, that’s nearly all the Five Mile”\n“Yep and I’m about to shove it up Glen Taylor’s Arse, all in one Go” I said.\n“Good “said Klaus “I hope it fucking kills him”.\nGlen Taylor had bought Klaus real estate business, and then promptly screwed him on the deal.\n“How much do you owe him to clear your Franchise Debt, so you can sell again without paying him commission” I asked Klaus.\n“Three hundred and Sixty Eight Thousand give or take, why.”\n“So Three Hundred and seventy should see you clear,” asked him.\n“Yep” he nodded.\n“Have you got his bank details handy Klaus.”\n“Yep” he nodded once again.\n“Watch and learn how the really rich can fuck you over” I said while giving Klaus a hug.\nI picked up the phone and pressed call\"Nigel Handrey speaking, how may I assist You Mr Adams”\n“Nigel could you please deposit Three hundred and Eighty thousand into this account for me please, As I gave him the number, and I will have some other matters later on this evening as well.”\n“Will that be all you require?”\n“For the Moment, Thank You Nigel.”\n“You’re Welcome sir, have a pleasant evening goodbye.”\nThe rest just stood mouths agape looking at each other in stunned silence.\n“As I said before and I’ll say it again to you all now. This is the First Division Folks it doesn’t get any bigger than this.”\n“Klaus grab three contracts, you’ll come with me to the MacKinnons, and well get this sorted, now!”\nYou girls help your Mothers to get this cleaned up.\n“Willie your doing research with Professor Barnard right, how’s that going,” I asked.\n“Was going OK but they have cut our funding because the Americans are doing the same sought off research”\n“Hang on because they are on the same track they cut your funding, that’s fucking moronic” I said.\n“That’s pretty much what the Prof said.”\n“What’s he like the Professor, know his stuff, open to new ideas” I asked.\n“Yea he’s not bad normally, but he’s really upset at the moment about the funding. Why”\n“How much did they take off him?” I asked.\n“60 Mill”, he replied looking perplexed.\n“Ouch that’s got to Hurt, How much do you reckon you would need to have a really good crack at it? Ballpark, OK” I asked Willie. Willie replied saying, “I heard him say once if he had the proper funding and facilities he could solve it, all he needed was about One hundred Million and a free run.”\n“OK that’s Doable, Put a proposal together for me to look at with Costing for equipment etc OK.”\n“Now” said Willie.\n“Yep No time like the present, Willie.”\nHelena I said.\n“Yes Max.”\n“Grab me all the info you can find on the uses of Molly with superconductors OK.”\n“Now.”\n“Yep to that as well.”\n“You girls give her hand with the research,” I said looking at Veronica and Inga.\n“You Big Girls have a look at Building plans with 30 beds plus for me, costing as well, there are some good sites in the states you can use, OK Ranch style High ceilings.”\n“Give us a Kiss you lot, we have got to go, Have you the MacKinnons Number, Klaus, Good, lets rock and roll. Buddy and have some fun”. I kissed all my girls and all of Klaus’s as well. As we headed out to the car I asked Robin, “Robbie who’s Veronica’s Father”.\n“Grant Whitney” she answered softly.\nGrant Whitney, the Toorak Whitney’s. He was drug dealing, cheating low life, now thankfully, dead.\n“Ah” I said stopping now I understand why you didn’t tell her before.\n“Moo” I said looking at Veronica on the veranda.\n“Yes Maxie” said Veronica as she finally closed her mouth at the answer.\n“How would you like to be Veronica Adams?”\nShe came running out and Said While raining kisses “Call me late for Breakfast if you Like Max” as long as I’m with you, I don’t care what I’m called.”\n“OK Ethel I will see you when I get Back OK, You girls keep your pussies damp for us.”\n“OK Max” they chorused.\nAnna came out clutching the rolled up map, “you might need this” she said.\n“Thanks Mum” I said as I kissed her.\nAnna walked over to Klaus; kissed him saying, “Go get em tiger, love you” she smiled at us both. “Go on now bugger off, someone has to do the work round here.” She said to us through the car window.\n“I’ll bugger you, Mrs If you’re not careful,” I said looking at Klaus shaking my head.\n“Promises, promises” she said walking back towards the house laughing.\nAs I pulled out of the gate to drive to the MacKinnons, “about Anna buddy.”\n“Max he said if Anna wants you to fuck her fuck her, you two have been beating around the bush for years, it’s OK. Besides, I owe her one.\n“How so” I asked him.\n“Rachel” he said quietly.\nRachel Williams was Klaus assistant, big tits, big mouth, and small brain. I looked at him with my eyebrows raised.\n“Yep” was all he said.\n“Buddy I told you she was dud fuck, but did you listen, No, the old “Klaus a nater” just went on ahead, same with your esteemed business associate Mr Taylor, once again full steam, anything else in the pipeline I should Know about, Not planning WW Three are we”.\n“You know Stephanie was right, you are a shit”. He said as he looked out the window. “But you are my best friend, and I am so happy about you and Inga, that girl just worships the ground you walk on, take care of my baby girl OK Max.”\nMe I just laughed and smiled “First thing next week Inga’s got date with a tattooist, I’m getting a Health Care warning tattooed above her Fanny stating, “Use with extreme Caution, Dangerous Contents Below” and you’re asking ME to take care of HER. You are a very funny man” as we looked at each other and laughed.\n“Get one for Anna, as well then” he said which dam near caused me to hit a tree I was laughing that hard.\nI slowed down as we turned into the MacKinnons property, as we crested the rise leading down the house below, I turned to Klaus, “God I had forgotten how beautiful this place was, give Sara a bell to let her know were coming to visit” as I pulled over to admire the view.\n“OK” as Klaus talked to Sara I could see the evening shadows fall over the hill on the other side of the river, “Wow” was all I could say as Klaus looked up.\n“Yes it’s Beautiful, but we better hurry if we want to ambush the bad guys” as we could see headlights approaching over the Five Mile Bridge.\n“Park around the back, said Klaus out of sight OK”.\nAs we pulled up, the back door opened and Sara Mackinnon appeared at the door, saying “What brings you two gentlemen here at this time of the day, social or business.”\n“A bit of both” I said kissing her on the cheek I hoping to save you from the Barbarians” I said.\n“Well your too late, were already here” said a Voice from the kitchen Glen Taylor stood smirking at us as we entered the room, I stuck my hand for him to shake he took it instinctively, I pulled him off balance, kicked him in the balls and punched him as he went down, sporting no, fucking effective hell yea.\n“Hi Alex” I said how are you”. Alex being well mannered replied “Well thank you, and you.”\n“Good really good”. I saw a contract on the table picked it up looked at the figure tore it half and put it into the open fire. Before he or anyone could say something, “did his lordship tell you they are going to turn your place into Suburbia and destroy it” They both shook their heads. “No, didn’t think so, ask Klaus, if you don’t believe me” As Alex’s son Hamish came into the house accompanied by three suits. “Hi Hamish.”\n“What’s going on here dad?” he asked, as he saw Glen on the floor, still clutching his balls.\n“Do you know what they are planning to do to your Dads Property, Yes or No Hamish?” I asked.\n“They are going to make it a high end acreage estate,” said Hamish looking at his Father then me.\n“How many blocks did you see on that draft plan Klaus.”\n“45 hundred” he said.\n“Bullshit Hamish answered back I’ve seen the plan and it’s only a 100 lots.”\n“That so” I said.\n“It’s all academic anyway said one of the suits we have signed contracts” he said smirking.\nWhich was really the wrong thing to say as Alex was just about ready to explode.\n“Is this true Glen?” he said looking down, and if you lie to me I’ll kick you in the balls as well.\"\n“Yes”-said Glen.\n“Jesus Fucking Sweet Mary and Joseph”, he roared punching the nearest suit flush on the chin, pole axing him, Hamish decked the other, and the third offered up the contracts, which went promptly into the fire.\n“Would you Gentlemen care for a drink?” asked Sara holding a Silver platter with Glasses and Beers on them.\n“Thank you Sara” I said.\n“Yes please said Klaus, I think Glen might need some Ice for his balls”.\n“Of course” she replied smiling getting an ice pack from the freezer and handing it to, Glen Sitting on the floor.\n“That was Fun” I said looking at Alex. Who was rubbing his knuckles, Sara passed him an ice pack to.\n“Now” I said to Alex as I rolled out the map, I’ve already got Klaus’s place\" I said.\n“You swore you would never sell it Klaus” said Alex starting to bristle.\n“Sorry Alex, my Mistake, leased it, I have to marry Inga, and he’s forcing me to make love to Anna, the things I have to do to get deals done,” I said.\n“He’s making you do what,” he said ready to go off again.\n“Calm down Alex and have another Drink”, said Sara, “Inga’s been Mooning after Max, for God knows how many years, and as for Anna you are a very lucky man.”\n“Thank you Mame” I said smiling.\nThe head suit finally regained some sought of Composure saying, “You’ll be hearing from my lawyers”.\n“You three sit down and shut the fuck up, or I’ll take all of you swimming with an anchor round your neck”. They shut up and sat. Me I picked up his Business card looking at the company Name Landmark Property Investments Melbourne.\nIn addition, made a call “Nigel here Mr Adams how may I be of assistance, I read out the company name, and asked Public or Private”.\n“Its public sir”, he answered.\n“How much would I need to spend to short the stock and leave a smoking ruin, ballpark,” I said.\n“Best guess 300 to 400 Million”.\n“Could you hang on please Nigel” Looking over at the people concerned, “your call fellers” is there a problem, No.\n“It’s OK Nigel” just wondering, “Hold on for second could you please Nigel”.\n“No problem, Mr Adams”.\n“Alex how does how does 8 Mill sound for your place with a signed undertaking it will not be developed, an Ill chuck in 2 Mill for Hamish to buy the Farm he’s always wanted out west near my sisters place, happy with that”, Alex Nodded after looking at Sara.\n“Nigel, how is Landmark traveling? Are they OK or do they need some assistance, without breaking propriety.”\n“Thank you sir, they are quite over leveraged and I have heard they may have to divest themselves of some of their properties”.\n“Other than that, how’s the company?” I inquired.\n“Very good sir, cash flows are stable and they have a substantial property portfolio,” replied Nigel.\n“So if one were to assist in there deleveraging, the return would be OK”.\n“Very Sir” was the answer.\n“Roughly what sought of deleveraging would one need to look at, best guess?” I asked laughing.\n“I’d guess in the vicinity off 40 million or there about, Sir,” said Nigel.\n“Ah I said any news as to when the rest of my iceberg is arriving.”\n“It looks to be arriving next week”. He answered laughing.\n“Thank you Nigel could you please deposit the funds Directly into Mr and Mrs MacKinnons accounts. I’ll put Mrs MacKinnon on to provide you with the details, Thank you Nigel.”\n“You’re Welcome sir,” he said as I passed Sara the phone.\nI looked over at the suits and down a Glen, “OK fellers here how it’s going to go, Cross me on this and it will get ugly, really ugly.“Now Glen you’re from Melbourne correct, yes?”\n“Yes Max” he replied.\n“You Now work for Klaus, “Schmitt, Adams and Taylor” “SAT Investments” a private investment group”.\n“We are going to provide funding for Landmark a sum to be advised”, yes, I said looking at the suits. As they looked at each other stunned, and nodded back. We will obliviously have seats on the board the makeup and number will be mutually agreeable yes. Good all sorted”.\n“Also Glen.”\n“Yes Max.”\n“Divorce that Barbie doll you’re married to, She’s been fucking the help and they have knocked her up. OK” don’t just take my word ask Sara?\" I added. Sara nodded. “Sorry Glen He’s right”.\n“If it were me Id Marry Serena, before you say anything, she’s your, Stepdaughter, She loves you, God knows why, and a least her tits are real, and way better looking, am I right fellers” a chorus of yes’s confirmed my observation.\n“Why.”\n“You’re not a bad bloke at heart, my kids like you and they are a pretty good judges of character, just be yourself and don’t try so hard, sorry about your nuts, nah not that sorry, Sorry”.\nAs well all broke up laughing, I went over to introduce myself, and Klaus to our new business partners. We were all having another beer when I said to Hamish, “Ham”\n“Yea Max”.\n“If you see other properties up around that way, get Narelle to give me a yell OK”. Narelle was my younger sister who owned and was running a Sheep property out west. She had gone out on her own with her Husband Terry producing ultra fine merino wool for the fashion market, they been advised against it by their bank and I had funded them in a 60 / 40 partnerships it had bled money for years, but in the last 6 years they were making serious money.\nWith my fashion contacts in Milan they were able to forward sell direct, helping their cash flow and expenses, they were wanting to expand I couldn’t see that would be a problem now.\nSara took me aside to thank me for helping them out, she said, “God men are such weird creatures they beat the hell out of each other then have a beer and laugh, what on earth you were talking about icebergs, and such.”\n“I’ve sold the money pit,” I said.\n“Oh Max I’m so happy” she said giving me a hug, Alex looked over at us.\n“Max sold the Money pit she said”\n“Finally, Id would have sold it years ago” Alex said.\nI had had previous offers, which Matt and I had rejected.\n“You do OK,” he asked as the others listened in.\n“Yea” I said smiling I did OK Klaus started laughing,\n“What?” said Alex looking perplexed?\nI looked at Klaus and Nodded as he said “if you can call $54 billion OK”, as Alex had a mouthful of beer go out his nose.\n“Fuck, Klaus I didn’t know that was catching”. The suits as well as Glen looked stunned. You don’t bring a knife to a gunfight.\n“Sorry folks we must away Maidens to Ravish, and country’s to conquer.” I said kissing Sara Hugging Alex and Hamish. Shook hands with the suits, pretended to kick Glen.\n“Glen sorry about Wendy (his Barbie Doll) wife it’s all around town buddy, “Yea it will get ugly and expensive, we will work something out so you don’t get to badly screwed,” Don’t say anything about this OK just Say Sara wouldn’t sign, you know how stubborn she can be”.\nThey all laughed at that even the suits, she was good people. In addition, Gentlemen Mum is the word until it we get figures etc OK.\n“Yes Max not a problem”.\nMe I was looking forward to resting my weary head not to mention my weary Prick and Balls as well. I looked at Sara and Alex “you can stay as long as you need to get what you’re doing sorted, wait till you see the plans I’m doing for the new house.\n“How big is it?” asked Sara.\n“What the house, I deadpanned smiling, 30 plus beds or so”, awaiting the expected liquid projections.\n“Just How many people are going to live their?” asked Sara.\n“Me plus my Girls, Inga, and Veronica and Robin Masters”, I said.\n“You’ve got three women,” Sara said amazement showing in her voice,\n“For a start I said”.\n“How many do you need then?” she laughed.\n“I don’t know enough to have 20 or 30 kids.”\n“I might offer Sara”, said Alex.\n“I don’t think even I could afford her”, I laughed. Sara looked at me smiling “You sir, are a Gentleman”, and turning to Alex, “You sir, are on rations”.\n“That’s our Max said Klaus spreading cheer and good will among the kind folk of Hastings”.\n“See you later Alex, Sara; keep in touch OK good Night.”\nWe walked out to the car “that went well,” I said.\nKlaus shook his head laughing, “You sure don’t do things by half, do you.”\nMe I just smiled “I don’t know about you but I’m looking forward to a bit of a rest and an early night”.\nHow wrong I was to be on both counts.\n",

<p>As I crested the other side of the hill, my mobile rang an unknown number on the display.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Adams&rdquo;, I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nigel Handrey, Mr Adams, Auspac Private Banking, Sydney&rdquo; came the cultured tone of a Privately Educated Englishman, through the speaker. That exact moment the signal disappeared, I braked putting the car in reverse, and backed up the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you there Mr Adams? came a worried Voice through the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I asked to whom am I speaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nigel Handrey Auspac Private Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it in regards to Mr Handrey?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alone sir?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; I replied</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s regarding the Five Hundred Odd Million dollars in your account Sir?&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me they want it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Sir, Not at all, I&rsquo;m just ringing to inform you, I have moved it, out of your account,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve Done Fucking What&rdquo; I yelled all manners and civility gone in a split second.</p>
<p>A wry chuckle came out from the speaker, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s still there, but not there, if that makes sense&rdquo;, he said continuing before I could go off again, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s to stop prying eyes at branch level Sir, I am assigned To You Mr Adams, to facilitate any monetary assistance that you might require&rdquo; he finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that should make it easier then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly Sir&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bugger&rdquo; I uttered realizing then about the Cheques I had written earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a problem Sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have written a couple of cheques out of that account,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no problem at all Sir&rdquo; quoting, the next Two Cheques in my checkbook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what amount and to who are they issued?&rdquo; he asked as I rattled of the required information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get them straight into their Accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where is the fun in that?&rdquo; I said shaking my head and chuckling&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As the sound of an approaching, car came up the hill.</p>
<p>It was Klaus Schmitt on his way home, &ldquo;Hang on Nigel&rdquo; I said as I hit the mute button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Schultz how&rsquo;s it going I was just on my way to see you, I&rsquo;m just on the phone to my personal banker&rdquo; I said realizing how dumb that statement sounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang on Klaus, Nigel are you still there?&rdquo; I asked into the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Sir&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and get a cuppa I&rsquo;ll rang you back in Five minutes OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Sir I will wait for your call, Thank you&rdquo; he said while hanging up.</p>
<p>Klaus looked at me wondering, what in god&rsquo;s name was going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank took some money from my account and just rang me to let me know&rdquo; I said .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a drink buddy? I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zero, Diet, or full strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full one thanks,&rdquo; he said as I handed it over for him to open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did they take out your account, if you don&rsquo;t mind me asking?&rdquo; he asked just before he&rsquo;d taken a mouthful of drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five Hundred&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Thousand&rdquo; he said as his eyebrows rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Million&rdquo; I answered, as a stream of coke came out from his nose and mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullshit&rdquo; he said coughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have had the light one Schultzie, you never could handle full strength&rdquo; I said laughing, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s not Bullshit either.&rdquo; as he finally regained his composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; was all he replied. As his wife Anna, and daughter Inga, came up the hill and stopped alongside us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello Darling&rdquo;, she said to Klaus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello Max&rdquo; she said to me, while turning over her shoulder to talk to her daughter slouched in the back seat. &ldquo;Say Hi to Max, Inga&rdquo; Inga&rsquo;s head came up, as she went a deep shade of red, as she saw who it was; her Mother wanted her to say high to. She then, burst into tears, getting out from the car, and running up the driveway into her house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in heaven&rsquo;s name was that all about&rdquo; her father asked first looking at his wife, than at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me? Anna answered, she&rsquo;s been acting strange all day&rdquo; as they both turned to look at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buggered If I know, she seemed OK this morning, when I gave her and the kids a lift to school&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kids? Anna asked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lauren and Holly, and Louise&rsquo;s two boys?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh said Anna, you know she&rsquo;s got the biggest crush on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you did promise to marry her if she got High Distinctions in her exams?&rdquo; Anna said laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh fuck!&rdquo; was all I could add. I went ashen, at that remembered promise.</p>
<p>Klaus and Anna both looked at me in stupefied wonder.</p>
<p>My mobile rang, talk about saved by the bell, I pressed answer, &ldquo;Hello Nigel&rdquo; I said into the mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the Fucks Nigel, said Stephanie out of the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait one Fanny&rdquo; I said using her pet name and put her on mute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I see you both up in the house, I said to the Schmitt, I&rsquo;ve got a business proposition I need to discuss with you, so give me Fifteen OK?&rdquo; They both nodded as they pulled out into the driveway of their house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up Fanny?&rdquo; I said back into the phone.</p>
<p>Stephanie came back on to the speakers, &ldquo;Where are you Lauren needs to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m up at Schultzie place why&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi daddy&rdquo; Laurens Voice issued into the car, something happened this morning, but I forgot to tell you, in all the excitement&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know PSD was catching&rdquo; I replied laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny&rdquo; was all she said, chuckling just the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you want to tell me sweetie, I&rsquo;ve got a meeting with the Schmitt&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh shit Its about Inga Daddy, she was way weird, when she got out of the car this morning at school, she asked me about 50 questions, about what was going on between you, and Veronica&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say to her?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a lot, as I didn&rsquo;t know a lot, she saw how you and Veronica were looking at each other, and when I said I didn&rsquo;t Know, she called me a lying Cow, and stormed off in tears to the washrooms. I thought she was going to hit me, she was that upset&rdquo; said Lauren in one long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the belated heads up Kiddo&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I have just been reminded by her Mother, that I promised to marry her If she got Distinctions in her finals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Fuck&rdquo; said Lauren, which was turning out to be the statement of choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have put it any better myself Sweetie&rdquo; I said laughing back at her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having money sure do&rsquo;s ramp up the excitement level,&rdquo; Lauren replied breaking into laughter herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many churches, do you want me to book Maxie, her mother piped up into the phone&rdquo; causing the ever so resultant laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang on got to pee&rdquo; I said opening the door, and peeing down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Better, as I put my penis back away, just as the another call light Lit up, Got to go girls I will ring you back as soon as I can OK bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Adams, Nigel Handrey&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry Nigel family dramas, life was just so much easier when I was only just comfortably, wealthy&rdquo; I said laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Define comfortably&rdquo; said Nigel with a wry chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said I laughing loudly, &ldquo;God I&rsquo;ve got two women I promised to marry both upset, with me. Do you want one, I&rsquo;ll pay you to take them off my hands,&rdquo; I said laughing even harder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bat for the other side&rdquo; Nigel replied laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Course you do, you&rsquo;re a bloody pommy,&rdquo; I said falling onto to the console in hysterics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right&rdquo; was the laughing rejoinder back from Nigel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve switch a time or too myself &ldquo;I said, wishing instantly, that I could take that statement back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well it does improve one&rsquo;s batting average, Sir&rdquo; was all Nigel replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all need our batting averages improved&rdquo; I said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right&rdquo; said Nigel &ldquo;Now If I may get back to the matter in question Sir. I am your, personal banker Mr Adams, if there is anything that you require in regards to your account. Or related banking matter, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to call Day or Night, I&rsquo;m here on call 24 hours a Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t leave you much of a social life&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not discuss matters of a personal nature Mr Adams If I may&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite Right, Totally, unprofessional of me Mr Handrey&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Handrey is my father Sir; I&rsquo;m perfectly comfortable with Nigel, Mr Adams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry Nigel please accept my apology&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to Sir, it&rsquo;s all good, as they say&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Handrey I said you&rsquo;re not related to Sir Alistair Handrey, are you? If you don&rsquo;t mind me asking that is,&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all Sir, He&rsquo;s My Father, Do you know Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I do as a matter of fact; My Mother is married to his Brother in Law, Sir George Chambers&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really&rdquo; was all he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Really, My Mother, is or I should say was, Helen Black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; was the quite reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have met as well I said; I think we might have even had some batting practice, together, if my memory serves.&rdquo; I said. Remembering a torrid fucking and sucking session out in the Saddle room. While staying at my sister&rsquo;s property, I&rsquo;m not gay, but, I have fucked a few who are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever visit up Hasting way Nigel, look me up, you will find my batting technique has greatly improved, since our last practice session.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recall your batting technique was quite OK Max, if you don&rsquo;t mind me saying&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always nice to complimented on ones technique, Nigel, Thank You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pleasure&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I remember correctly, the pleasure was Mutual Buddy,&rdquo; I laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite&rdquo; was all he said in Reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Nigel, Yes Sir&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sirs matey, were family, if you need any money at all, just give me a yell, OK, that&rsquo;s just the tip of a very big iceberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, thank you for asking; just how big is this iceberg exactly?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About 20,000 tons give or take,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit that Big&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep and that&rsquo;s, not the only Iceberg, but they don&rsquo;t know that, OK&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Max, Discretion is my middle name&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was Winston&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always were a funny bugger Max&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try Nigel, I Try, Seriously Nigel, I Know your Family has had some financial dramas, and just let me know how much, if any you need, OK Buddy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let my father know He won&rsquo;t accept charity I know that much for certain&rdquo;. He said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK how about a loan no interest, payable when ever, just so he can get back on his feet, and fix the family ruin up like it deserves. Run that by him Nigel OK, I have got to go, I&rsquo;m being paged&rdquo;. Klaus and Anna were on the balcony waving at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye Matt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye Nigel&rdquo; I replied as I hung up.</p>
<p>I drove up to the house saying to Klaus and Anne as I got out of the car. &ldquo;Sorry about that, Banker wankers; you know what they are like, Now where&rsquo;s my Fianc?&rdquo; I asked them both as we walked inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in her room with the door locked, crying her eyes out&rdquo; said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be my day for crying females, I said or is it that time of the year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or month&rdquo; said Klaus earning himself a dirty look from Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inky Open the Door, sweetheart, Max is here to talk said Anna gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, I hate you all&rdquo; was what we got back through the door in reply. Anna tearing up shrugged her shoulders in resignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have a crack at her&rdquo; I said kissing Anna gently on the Cheek. OK she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open this Fucking Door, you Big arsed, Saggy Titied, House Cow, before I kick it in up your ass&rdquo; I yelled Klaus and Anna stood in stunned silence, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all in the delivery&rdquo;, I said as Inga unlocked and opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you my darling,&rdquo; I said gently, as she sobbed into my chest. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the problem, can&rsquo;t find a church you like, Not sure what music to play&rdquo; I smiled as I kissed away her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are just such a shit&rdquo; she laughed while hitting me on the chest.</p>
<p>I grabbed her face in both hands and kissed her hard, my tongue right down to her socks. I let her come up for air I looked at her face and kissed her again, gently &ldquo;Better&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much&rdquo; she said kissing and hugging me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on&rdquo; I said leading her into the bathroom to freshen her up, Giving her a damp washer.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;You look even uglier than usual, looking like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wiped her face and threw the washer at me &ldquo;Do not&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do to&rdquo; I said back to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said I was Beautiful, So there&rdquo; sticking out her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Nationals&rdquo; she replied fixing her hair in the mirror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was there alcohol involved?&rdquo; I asked knowing it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; she said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t count, any statement made, that&rsquo;s effected by an alcoholic beverage is null and void&rdquo; I said looking at Klaus and winking. &ldquo;Ask your Dad if you don&rsquo;t believe Me.&rdquo; she looked at her father who was nodding his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right&rdquo; I said as she started to tear up again.</p>
<p>I walked up to her and kissed her once again. Looking at her saying &ldquo;Am I Drinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>I kissed her again, &ldquo;Your Beautiful and I love you, Now do a, wee and join us in the kitchen OK&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Maxie&rdquo; she said smiling.</p>
<p>I ushered her parents out the room, as she sat on the toilet, her mother all the Time shaking her head, and muttering. &ldquo;How in heavens name do you do that&rdquo; she said still shaking her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Gift&rdquo; I replied Sitting on a chair in the meals area.</p>
<p>As Inga walked in and before she sat on my lap, I asked her &ldquo;Inky could you get your dads big aerial map and a china graph pencil for me please darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you need a boner, cushion?&rdquo; she said smiling at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I think we can forgo them now.&rdquo; I replied laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what cushion&rdquo; her mother said, As Inga curled up into my lap, moulding her body into mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boner cushion, so Max didn&rsquo;t, you know get a hard on if we were sitting on his lap&rdquo; she said demonstrating it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t know that while you were coaching her at surf rescue&rdquo; Anna said.</p>
<p>Inga started laughing at her mother &ldquo;we used to do it deliberately, to rev him up&rdquo; she said wriggling in my lap. Inga put her hand between her legs feeling my half hard prick.&ldquo;Yep still got it&rdquo; she laughed wriggling even more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it or it will poke your eye out Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promises, Promises&rdquo; she said laughing.</p>
<p>Both her parents had stopped to stare at us both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK I said&rdquo; getting back to the elephant in the room. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the problem with you Inky, what do you want to know&rdquo; I said looking at her. I could feel her tense up at the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you looking at Veronica Masters, as you drove us all to school, you looked as if you were both ready to fuck each others brains out?&rdquo; she said. &lsquo;Yep we sure did, she dam near killed me, the little bugger, God what a trip&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in love with her&rdquo; said Inga. I could feel her getting ready to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desperately, madly, passionately&rdquo; I said, Holding Inga to my chest, I could feel her tears on my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, How&rdquo; she whispered, looking at me, tears streaming down her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Morning, at breakfast&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long have you been in love with her?&rdquo; Inga asked. Not wanting to know the answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This morning, while at breakfast?&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not even sixteen yet, Max for Christ sake, she&rsquo;s a child, and she couldn&rsquo;t possibly know about love,&rdquo; Anna said with all the moral indignation only a mother can muster.</p>
<p>I looked first at Inga, &ldquo;how long have you been in love with me my darling,&rdquo; I asked her, kissing her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I was 8 nearly 9&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has that changed since then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No she said, I love you even more now, than I did then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good &lsquo;Same for me Inky Pinkie Poo&rdquo; I said tickling her under the arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do&quot; she said eyes wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for you, you hypocritical old house Frau, I distinctly remember a drunken conversation about a 15 year old school girl wagging class, so she could go and fuck the brains out of her 25 year old boy friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And looking at the result, it didn&rsquo;t turn out so bad now, Did it!&quot;</p>
<p>I could see Anna getting ready to let me have it with both barrels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a vast difference in your ages, are they going to be on some fucking roster at your pleasure, and besides, you just said how madly in love you are, with Veronica. And furthermore, what&rsquo;s Inga suppose to do, play second fiddle to some bastard, and as for money, what are going to do about that, magically pull it out of your arse&rdquo; she yelled.</p>
<p>Anna bought tanks, and artillery.</p>
<p>Me I went for nuclear, typical German starting something they just cannot win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All valid, but all crap, Jesus Anna I love you, but if your head was any further up your arse you&rsquo;d disappear. Wait one minute,&rdquo; I said halting the attack on Berlin, and we all know how that turned out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Anna 4 points, 4 answers&rdquo;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inga you came second at the National under twelves, are you going to give that medal back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck, no Way&rdquo; she said, and realized where I was going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anna point 2 is for you; your father is how many years older than your Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;33 years&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that relationship sure went to shit didn&rsquo;t it&rdquo;. The said couple had just celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary. &ldquo;In addition, you&rsquo;re the eldest of 6 children. Correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 2 Nil!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for my Fiance being a bastard, birds of a feather flock together, not being told, and not knowing are two entirely different questions. I think you would agree with that statement, my darling,&rdquo; I said looking over at Veronica, and her Mother standing in the doorway listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Inga Will you hop up for a second and pull my bank account from out of my arse&rdquo;, I said Miming said action. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this amount, $20 Billion, you heard it here first folks&rdquo;. All mouths dropped, except for Veronica s, That&rsquo;s a 20, with how many zeros, that&rsquo;s a 9 folks&quot;. I replied before finishing with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s 4 nil. And for the roster, my poor dear old Mother in Law to be&rdquo;, I said. Getting up to hug and kiss Anna, &ldquo;That is freaking brilliant idea; it&rsquo;s the only rest I&rsquo;m ever going to get. As these two will no doubt try, and fuck me into an early demise. That&rsquo;s game don&rsquo;t you think&rdquo;. I said picking up a biscuit and kissing Anna at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; she said hugging me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all good Anna&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Adams&rdquo;, I said introducing myself, &ldquo;you must be Veronica&rsquo;s mother, Robin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your eyes are crossed just like your Daughters&rdquo; I replied stepping back.</p>
<p>As first Veronica, then Inga collapsed with hysterical laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question. Whether I should kiss you or kill you for molesting my underage daughter,&rdquo; Robin replied, standing with hands on her hips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss I think, you will find the molesting was fairly evenly distributed wasn&rsquo;t, it Moo?&rdquo; I asked looking at Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty much even&rdquo; Veronica she said, &ldquo;I think I owe you one&rdquo; does that count as brownie point Maxie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No my darling, that&rsquo;s a Brown eye point&rdquo; I quipped as again liquid; in this case coffee came out Klaus nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you need, a Sippy mug, Klaus?&rdquo; I asked which earned me the little known, German one finger salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we are on the subject of Molesting, Max&rdquo;, said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goody you want to molest me, Oh yes please Mummy&rdquo; I laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Max, seriously it&rsquo;s about Inga&rdquo; she said in a concerned tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You want me to seriously, molest Inga, Anna Oh Goody.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max, be serious for once, please&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry Anna, Darling Number Two could you come her please&rdquo; I asked looking at Inga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anna, Klaus over here, please&rdquo; I said to them &ldquo;Still there&rdquo;, I whispered to Inga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep&rdquo;, she nodded, as I lifted her skirt and lowered her panties past her bottom down to her knees. They had now fallen down to her ankles, as she lifted her Right leg to step out of them, her mound and vulva in all its beauty came on display.</p>
<p>Inga&rsquo;s snatch and her vulva were there for all to see. Only one word could describe it, perfect. Shape, perfect, Form once again perfect, Colour perfect again. Whoever was in charge of pussy assembly, on the day Inga arrived, deserved a gold medal. Moreover, the great thing about it, it was all mine.</p>
<p>I wet my right index finger and ran it up the folds of her labia. Once it was fully wet, I eased it gently into her vaginal canal. It stopped, I removed my finger from her as she sighed and shivered, and I licked it clean. Wow the taste was unbelievable. I grabbed her Mothers right hand and sucking on her index feature, inserted that until it stopped, pulled it out and licked it clean.</p>
<p>I repeated the same procedure for Klaus. Inga by this time was gibbering wreck on the verge of collapse. My trusty sidekick Veronica came to her rescue, kissing her, while gently lowering Inga onto to the rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we have here Ladies and Gentlemen, Is probably the only 17 year old virgin left in Hastings shire. Molested, I don&rsquo;t think so, preserved, and protected while all the time saving her from the pimpled Girl ravaging, beasts, out there on the savannah&rdquo; I said looking at Klaus and Anna, who were in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deserve a bloody medal,&rdquo; I added, While giving both of them a kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea how hard it was, both in the literal and physical sense, not to throw her over a pile of surf gear and fuck her senseless for a month of Sundays&rdquo; I said to them both.</p>
<p>Veronica by this time was administering her own type of care, kissing and nibbling Inga, over her eyes, ears lips and neck. She was running her hand over Inga&rsquo;s breasts. Once again prefect, two perfectly sized 36 Inch Boobs the Size and diameter of a rock-melon cut in half.</p>
<p>Veronica was running the flat of her hand over Inga s raised mound gently rubbing her clit. I was enjoying the show eating a biscuit, Klaus was holding Anna, nuzzling and biting on her neck.</p>
<p>I beckoned Robin over, over to me, as she was standing squirming rubbing her thighs together watching as well. Veronica had inserted a finger into Inga&rsquo;s pussy causing Inga to shudder and moan even more than she been previously.</p>
<p>I had one arm around Robin massaging her left breast, while eating another biscuit.</p>
<p>Veronica announced &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;. After first, smelling, and then tasting Inga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biscuits&rdquo; I said, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are such a dick Max Adams, Veronica laughed, Inga smells of cookies&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I said&rdquo;. As I nuzzled into Robins neck while running my hand up her thigh to her pussy, and getting a sample of my own, as both girls watched on from the floor.</p>
<p>I sampled the aroma of Robin&rsquo;s pussy, and juices as well. I kissed her on the neck and ear saying to Veronica &ldquo;Cookies here too, as well as melons&rdquo;. After putting my left hand back on Robin&rsquo;s gloriously full rock-melon sized breast.</p>
<p>She moaned and leaned back into me saying &ldquo;Cookies, what all the drama about cookies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more interested in the melons at the moment&rdquo; as I rubbed her left nipple between my fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God that feels so good, it&rsquo;s been so long,&rdquo; she moaned. Robin was rubbing her own pussy with her right hand.</p>
<p>My penis by this stage had gained full hardness and was rubbing on the crease of her arse between her thighs that felt good too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max get down here and make love, to Inga before I rip your prick of and feed it to Charlie Dog,&rdquo; Veronica said angrily. Then more calmly &ldquo;Maxie please Inky been wanting you to fuck her since she was nine,&rdquo; Said Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please Max I want you to make love to me so badly, I&rsquo;ve waited so long&rdquo; pleaded Inga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duty calls I must away&rdquo; I said putting Robin&rsquo;s breast back in her bra, with her nipple sitting up like a flagpole. Robin sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mummy you can keep Maxie hard for Inga, come on, she really needs him, please mum&rdquo; in best kid whiny voice you know the one I mean?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Mum start earning your keep&rdquo; as I helped her back up from of the Chair, I untied my drawstring to drop my pants.</p>
<p>As my prick came into full view as I stepped out my clothes, after lowering my pants and jocks.</p>
<p>Veronica said to Inga &ldquo;look Inky isn&rsquo;t it beautiful, it&rsquo;s so pretty&rdquo; exactly want a feller wants to hear, Not! Handsome, majestic, awesome pick one, but not pretty.</p>
<p>I was looking down at the scene on the rug before me; Veronica in her now favourite position, Inga snuggled in her arms, gently massaging her clit and pussy. all the time kissing her on the neck. The girl was a bloody marvel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like this gift wrapped,&rdquo; I said to them both, they laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dick&rdquo; said Veronica, &ldquo;Ditto&rdquo; said Inga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we love you, they chorused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, for this&rdquo; I said, waving my penis like a conductors baton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t poke Mums eye out&rdquo; said Veronica laughing along with Inga. Robin on her knees was trying to latch hold of it, as it swung past her face.</p>
<p>The girls both looked at each other, &ldquo;Nah your money&rdquo; they answered, and then cracked up in laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have this then,&rdquo; said Robin finally grabbing hold of my penis, and putting into her mouth. &ldquo;Yum&rdquo; she said, mouth full of hard, hot cock. She rolled her tongue around the head of my prick. Massaging it with her lips, it felt wonderful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done that before&rdquo;, I said Looking down at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots&rdquo; was all she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum um!&rdquo; Veronica said her voice rising in panic, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you make Max go of&rdquo; as she gave Inga another small orgasm with her fingers. Inga just laid their covered in sheen of sweat, glowing. Wowser!</p>
<p>I removed my prick from Robin&rsquo;s oral assault, kissing her hard, saying thank you as I knelt down.</p>
<p>I was worried what to say in case I caused any stress, to anybody, especially Veronica. I need not have worried.</p>
<p>Sensing my distress she said &ldquo;My god Inky you are just so beautiful, no wonder Max loves you, promise you&rsquo;ll share him with me&rdquo; as her tears flowed down on to Inga&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You silly little bitch&rdquo; said Inga before kissing Veronica, then adding &ldquo;I was going to ask you the same question silly&rdquo; both hugging each other in affirmation.</p>
<p>Me I just proceeded to feast on Inga dripping pussy. Like Homer Simpson in an all, you can eat buffet. She was just a river of girl slime. When I had let her calm down, I rubbed my prick through her juices. Placing the head of my prick into her canal and said &ldquo;ready Baby&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>I shoved and I shoved hard. She squealed in pain as I jammed in six inches all in one go. Now why would I do that to someone I loved you ask. Two reasons really. One, Inga, superbly fit, near Olympic standard, Ripped and lean.</p>
<p>Two she had the highest threshold to pain of any person I had ever trained, man or women.</p>
<p>As the girls looked on in horror at what I had done.</p>
<p>I backed out two fed in Four.</p>
<p>Backed out six fed in eight, right to the base &ldquo;you OK baby&rdquo; I asked Inga.</p>
<p>Veronica meantime, had buried her face into in Mothers dripping snatch and was beavering away for all she was worth.</p>
<p>She saw her parents looking concerned for her that dissipated in an instant with, &ldquo;you are so full of shit Mama, we should have done this years ago, Maxie&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maxie&rdquo;, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck me really hard OK, I need you in me, now&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<p>Me I always like to keep my customers Happy so I switched into top gear and gave it to Inky, Hard.</p>
<p>Seven and a half in and out full steam ahead I could feel her starting to cum so I got Veronica to drop what she was doing and Keep Inky Wet, Really wet.</p>
<p>Veronica stopped chewing on Robins snatch and shoveled the fluids, from her own dripping cunt onto Inga&rsquo;s snatch and my prick. That worked a treat especially when she squatted over Inga, and dribbled on her face and breasts, whoever said making love should be private needed to get out more.</p>
<p>Inga came, not, with a bang, in one rolling wave.</p>
<p>Inga was giving birth, not trying to get pregnant.</p>
<p>We had been going hard at it for over ten minutes when Inga&rsquo;s orgasmic contractions plateau and she finally came.</p>
<p>Here stomach and Vaginal muscles contracting, tight, painfully, really painfully tight around my Prick.</p>
<p>I felt as I f someone had put it in a blender. Luckily Robin saw how I was, and started attacking Inga&rsquo;s clit like a dog with a bone sucking chewing and licking.</p>
<p>Robin looked down at my balls, and saw they had gone blue,&quot; Jesus Max they&rsquo;ve gone blue,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really&rdquo; I whimpered.</p>
<p>As Inga finally, eased off. And I was able to drive my prick hard into her canal. Inga was chanting in rhythm with our fucking, &ldquo;baby, I want a baby Max, give me your baby&rdquo; repeatedly.</p>
<p>Robin looked at me &ldquo;can you cum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I squeaked, &ldquo;Help now, arse&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She wet her fingers to massage my prostate, &ldquo;god you&rsquo;re a wreck&rdquo; when she saw the condition of my anal ring, she gently massaged it in and I came not with a bang, but a whimper. Both Inga and I were fucked, physically and literally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You OK baby&rdquo; I asked Inga as I finally pulled out, I was still three quarters hard, I kissed Veronica and Inga as I lay on my back, prick straight in the air, I motioned to Robin &ldquo;Hop on Robbie&rdquo; I said. Veronica pushed her out of the road, &ldquo;with its mine bitch.</p>
<p>I grabbed her before she hopped on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually mine, and sit on it Robbie, if you like&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK&rdquo; Robin said lowering her leg over and sitting down. Sighing, &ldquo;That feels so good&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a reward for services rendered,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>At that moment, Inga barked at her mother &ldquo;get me a chux quick, a clean one hurry&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Anna was just about to say something, saw the shake of my head and passed Inga the chux, which, she tore in half, stuffing it into her cunt with her legs in the air grunting, &ldquo;Get in get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice came from the opening door &ldquo;now that&rsquo;s a sight you don&rsquo;t see every day, need a hand Sis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie, Inga&rsquo;s older brother walked over, and Inga&rsquo;s older sister Helena following behind, as Willie folding the chux wedged it into Inga&rsquo;s cum filled snatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should hold it for you,&rdquo; he said. Before looking around saying, &ldquo;what in fucks name is going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anna predictably was about to go off, when she saw me shake my head, yet again.</p>
<p>Robin was just about to hop of my still semi hard prick; I said &ldquo;just spin around Robbie&rdquo; as I sat, with my back against the lounge legs bent, supporting Robin.</p>
<p>I looked at Veronica, sitting still, along Inga, &ldquo;Veronica you here, nodding to my right, Inga you here nodding to my left&rdquo;. They both moved quickly at the tone in my Voice.</p>
<p>I looked at Willie, &ldquo;you there, pointing, Helena, there, pointing opposite, Now&rdquo;.</p>
<p>OK as calm restored, Anna asked, &ldquo;Would anybody like a drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nodding, &ldquo;please I&rsquo;m dying of thirst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming right up&rdquo; said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; I asked the new arrivals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, were, good&rdquo; they answered as drinks were handed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Klaus Twenty won&rsquo;t be enough to buy this place will it asked him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No buddy, even you don&rsquo;t have enough to buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So how about I lease it, Happy with ten, as a nice round number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK&rdquo; said Klaus looking at Anna, was all that was needed to seal the deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, here the News, It&rsquo;s the Golden Rule, I said, I&rsquo;ve got the gold, and I Fucking Rule is that clear enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at the junior members, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Max&rdquo; they answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good that&rsquo;s squared away&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I looked at them all in the face, my eyes burning, they all, even Veronica knew that look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anybody and I mean anybody, ever talks to their Parents in that way again in my presence.</p>
<p>I will grab them by the scruff of the neck, tie them over a bench and I will have ten, no make that twenty mangy dogs fuck them up the arse, in public, are we clear on that&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Max, sorry Mummy, sorry Dad, Was the chorus from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tad extreme, said Anna I thought ten would have done&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does anybody want something to eat&rdquo; as she looked the aftermath of the Orgy. As we all, cracked up in laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love you,&rdquo; I said to my Girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love you too Max&rdquo; as they both Kissed Robin and I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Care to join my Merry band of minstrels I asked Robin&rdquo;, as I hugged her to my chest and kissed her on the neck and face, blowing Raspberries&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rdquo; she said laughing and moving around on my prick, giving herself little orgasm, in the process?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better?&rdquo; I asked, as she settled down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you want me to join in with this lot. Why?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well it would be nice to have someone nearer to my own age, to help me with my knitting in my dotage&rdquo;. &ldquo;Have a couple more Kids, That&rsquo;s if you want more Kids, this one turned out OK&rdquo;, I said hugging Veronica&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Id pay you, say 10 each or there about&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d pay me 10 thousand dollars to have your Kids&rdquo; she answered amazement in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would be your kids as well&rdquo;. I said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum, Mum&rdquo; called Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rdquo; said Robin?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the M word, not the T word, Mum&rdquo;. Veronica replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The M word Oh, million, you&rsquo;d pay $10 Million dollars for each child Id have&rdquo; she said in shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What it&rsquo;s not enough, I said hugging her &ldquo;OK make it 15 them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie piped up. &ldquo;Book me in for Two Max&rdquo; which set us all off again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is going on here said Willie, Are we on a TV reality series&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea it&rsquo;s called the Young and the Horny&rdquo; said Veronica looking at Inga.</p>
<p>As they both as usual, fell about on the rug in hysterics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we got a warm towel handy folks?&rdquo; Asked Robin</p>
<p>As she was just about to stand up of my prick, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not leaving are you&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nature calls&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Girly Stuff. Hope its big Towel&rdquo; I said deadpan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are such a Dick,&rdquo; she said laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know about that now&rdquo; said Veronica.</p>
<p>Making Robin and I both laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behave, or your mother will ruin another rug, I wondered where you, got it from&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rdquo; said Robin looking at us both?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max and I have ruined three rugs today?&rdquo; Veronica replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you think Mum?&rdquo; said Veronica shaking her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; she giggled no wonder you look like a train wreck&rdquo; said Robin as the towels arrived along with a warm washer.</p>
<p>Robins pussy made a Pop as she stood up, removing my prick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you kind sir&rdquo; she said curtsying.</p>
<p>I laughed saying &ldquo;you&rsquo;re welcome, Madame&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be made law that you have to make love, to your mother in law&rdquo;. I said looking at Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck in getting that Max&rdquo; laughed Klaus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anytime you&rsquo;d like too Max let me know&rdquo; said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Anna, it&rsquo;s a date&rdquo; I replied, wiping the smile of Klaus&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would you want to, with your entire new Harem&rdquo; Anna said quietly.</p>
<p>I finished cleaning myself, standing up, wrapped the towel around my waist, and kissed Anna passionately, while sticking two fingers up into her still moist Cunt, massaging it, till she came on my hand. I hugged her as she finished cumming, looking at Klaus, over her head, giving him a wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, because your daughter is a carbon copy of you?&rdquo; &ldquo;And I love you all to bits. I said kissing her again.</p>
<p>Now where&rsquo;s dinner you old Frau, I said smacking her on the bum with the towel that had fallen off on to floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Max&rdquo; she said looking at my prick.</p>
<p>She walked over and put in into her hand, &ldquo;Christ, will you look at it, it&rsquo;s blue, what in gods name did you do to him Inga?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all came to have a look, Robin held up to look underneath.</p>
<p>As I said to Veronica, &ldquo;did you bring your book of tickets?&rdquo; with all looking and laughing.</p>
<p>Inga had tears in her eyes &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Maxie&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just wasn&rsquo;t you Inky,&rdquo; I said looking over at Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little Max, has taken quite a beating today&rdquo; I laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dished it out as well,&rdquo; said Veronica walking towards me legs wide apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God I love you, you are so bloody funny,&rdquo; I said tearing up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sexy too&rdquo; said Veronica.</p>
<p>Anna came out from the bathroom holding a tube of ointment. &ldquo;This should help&rdquo; as she massaged it in.</p>
<p>With the result that it started to go hard, &ldquo;that is working&rdquo;, I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behave yourself&rdquo;, said Anna laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey Klaus, give little Klaus a couple of hits with the meat mallet, if you want to know how it feels,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh this feels good.&rdquo; Thanks Anna</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take more than a couple, said Willie to put a bruise on dads&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looked like you were giving it a good work out anyway&rdquo;, they all looked at me, wondering what I meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you lot didn&rsquo;t notice as Inga was attempting to chop my prick of with her pussy. Your father was giving your mother the rounds of the kitchen. I thought he was going to put your Mum through the wall&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I looked at Anna, before kissing her again. Robin picked up the tube looking at the instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK this might work&rdquo;. She spread it onto my bruised anal ring. It stung, and then started to feel better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much, thanks, does this mean were engaged?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She kissed me &ldquo;Yep book me in for a couple&rdquo; she said and kissed me again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Miss&rdquo;, she said looking at Veronica you&rsquo;re the only person who falls in love at first sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I said it&rsquo;s not my money then?&rdquo; I asked Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK the money is a factor, but it&rsquo;s mainly the Man&rdquo; she said Hugging Veronica, and kissing me again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, here did a good job of selling your good points to me, after I gave her the third degree as to why she wasn&rsquo;t in class today&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know she wasn&rsquo;t in class?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The school sent me a text, saying she was absent&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch, technology that sure will take the fun out of it&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s covered in hickies, and smells like a knock shop.&rdquo; She smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum was really, really pissed&rdquo; said Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t for the life of me think why&rdquo; I deadpanned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I let you smoke, or heaven forbid, drink, all I have done is guide you down the path of carnal lust and debauchery, just adding to your education, so to speak.&rdquo; I said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adding to her education, is that what they are calling it now days&rdquo;, said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a couple of chapters&rdquo; I said defending myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More like the whole, fucking book, plus the sequel&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Road to Rack and Ruin, I&rsquo;m calling it&rdquo; said Veronica hugging Inga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I know added Inga &ldquo;How to Fuck a Man to Death and Come away with Billions&rdquo; with the resulting laughter at my expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, Moo doesn&rsquo;t need any more encouragement thank you, Inky, that&rsquo;s my job&rdquo; I said before it became a competition at my expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were saying my darling&rdquo; looking at Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, smelling of sex, I asked the usual questions, the Who, What, When and where, Veronica said we had met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah Melons&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes melons, said Robin at least she had good taste, you do have a certain reputation you know Max&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; I asked dreading the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes you do, Karen Saunders gave me chapter and verse about you after the melon episode&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this melon business about&rdquo; interrupted Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max commented on the quality of my Melons&rdquo; Said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And quite nice melons they are too&rdquo; said Klaus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does Tuesday work for you Max, so you can come over, and fuck me senseless&rdquo; said Anna looking at Klaus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuesday should be fine, just let me check with the girls, are you all OK with Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three of them nodded, and said &ldquo;Tuesdays fine, with Inga adding you are going to love it Mum&rdquo; adding to Klaus ever increasing stress level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good said Anna, sorry for the interruption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at Klaus and winked, he smiled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was I said Robin Ah your reputation, Karen was,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Robin, if Karen Saunders said anything about me, she is talking through her arse anyone who made love to Karen Saunders, is too fucking lazy to masturbate&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>With Klaus, once again emitting drink out of his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry Klaus let me know when you&rsquo;re drinking right&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Robin, you were saying, Reputation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, Checking from more reliable sources other than poor Karen, you have made a lot of friends, that speak very highly of you&rdquo; &ldquo;And also of your good works in the community, that largely go unsung, which is unusual in its self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Experiencing, being let astray and being badly letdown myself, by an older man. I was as you could imagine not that happy that history might repeat itself. Veronica informed me that she was equally involved in what went on. And seeing her depth of feeling for you led me here, to ask what your intentions were regarding Veronica?&rdquo; She said finishing her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My intentions, my good woman are totally dishonorable. I fully intend as I said earlier, to further add to her education in the carnal pursuits, which I am hoping in the fullness of time, she will be able to educate me. She appears to be a willing student. I was thinking of adding a Dog and Pony act, even maybe a circus. Care to join us&rdquo; I said smiling and kissing first Robin, then Veronica in turn.</p>
<p>With Inga adding &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted a Pony&rdquo;. Hugging and kissing the three of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still In&rdquo; I said looking at Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Life&rdquo; she said tearing up and kissing me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me two, said Veronica, Me Three, said Inga, Me Four piped up Anna from the kitchen. Me five said Klaus.&rdquo; The resulting laughter, echoing around the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about you two, in the cheap seats&rdquo; I said looking at Willie and Helena, care to join my traveling band of miscreants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; asked Willie smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How doe&rsquo;s 5 mill each for a start sound,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to give us each 5 million dollars, for doing what&rdquo; she asked, well she was like her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak how many languages&rsquo; exactly, I asked Helena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three fluently, German, French and Engrish she laughed, pretty good Italian and Spanish, Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have how long to go before you finish your degree in Business Management?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I work my arse off six months or nine if I take it easy?&rdquo; she asked &ldquo;Why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about your geology electives?&rdquo; said her mother?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geology electives I inquired, since when&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I went out on field expeditions with the geology class, looking for Dinosaur Fossils, I really loved it and I already had three quarter of the units covered in Business Studies.&rdquo; She said.</p>
<p>Me I was still trying work my head around the tie in between Business Studies and Geology.</p>
<p>Helena could see my perplexed expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all Multi Units Now Max it&rsquo;s all connected. You have your Base units and you then add your electives to complete your degree, It&rsquo;s Called Integrated Streaming&rdquo;. She said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Integrated what the fuck do I know, me I just found a shit load of Molybdenum and sold it for a gazillion dollars&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How big, was the find?&rdquo; asked Helena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An area about twice the size of Hastings&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fucking hell&rdquo;, how much?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;54 Bill It&rsquo;s a joint venture, us and the Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah I see, Chinese, No wonder your happy they will be needing tons and tons of It&rdquo; she said looking over at us &ldquo;Sorry steel, Computers, there is some talk of superconductors as well, It was in one my science journals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Steve, would get on like a house on fire&rdquo; I said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinners ready&rdquo; Anna called from the kitchen, you can carry that on in here&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly carried on&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell don&rsquo;t hold back&rdquo; was the chorus of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Parents were tearing the Kitchen to pieces, the old feller here, I said looking at Klaus, was literally fucking your Mum towards next Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see the old folks having fun&rdquo; said Willie, to laughter all-round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might want to look on next time there&rsquo;s a show, and no tickets from you Moo, you will defiantly learn something&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you learn?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman never discusses such things, though I might add your mother is very flexible,&rdquo; I said looking at Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Add in Thursday as well if you have time of course,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I looked at my Girls, &ldquo;Thursdays Good&rdquo; as they stuffed their faces with food.</p>
<p>Klaus looked at me and said &ldquo;Be Gentle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I looked at Anna &ldquo;you heard the man please be gentle with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>My mobile started ringing it was Stephanie,&ldquo;Hi Fanny what&rsquo;s up, I said Hang on, you&rsquo;re on speaker there you go, what&rsquo;s happening Kiddo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brian checked the account and the moneys already in there how in God&rsquo;s name did you do that, we still have the cheque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not God. Nigel. He&rsquo;s my finance manager. You&rsquo;re dealing with the super wealthy now, darling not the merely comfortable peasantry like yourselves.&rdquo; Using on my best fake pommy accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are such a shit, she said laughing, and Brian was so looking forward into handing over the cheque and seeing their faces&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah but how much betters the result, when you go to the bank, dressed to the nines to close the account. I said. The laughter said it all &ldquo;You are truly evil Max Adams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try&rdquo; I replied smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Inga, is she OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the question should be am I OK, Inga Is fine, at present she stuffing half the food in the district in her plate as per usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a growing girl, Aunty Stephanie, it&rsquo;s all wonderful Max declared his undying love and I fucked him senseless a good result all-round I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did what, Max how many now you have collected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be Three,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose is the third?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin&rdquo; I said Veronica s Mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&rdquo; said Stephanie, &ldquo;Hi Buddy&rdquo;, Brian said in the Background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robin with the Melons&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes Robin with the Melons&rsquo; said Robin, sounding not too happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry my bad, Robin with the Melons, meet Stephanie with the Hole&rdquo; I said with the ever oh so predictable result from Stephanie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Adams you an unmitigated shit of the first order&rdquo; Stephanie yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitch Fight&rdquo; chorused Brian, you still selling Tickets Veronica,&rdquo; he said laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tickets get your tickets, next show starting soon,&rdquo; said Veronica as per script, God it was a laugh a minute.</p>
<p>Robin said contritely to Stephanie &ldquo;Robin here, Stephanie you are so right about Max, I was going to ring his neck for corrupting my poor little girl, bit I thought no bugger that, I&rsquo;ll join them and spend all his Money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you and I need to catch up and have a drink and compare notes, As for your little girl, I think the corrupting was fairly evenly shared from what I&rsquo;ve been told&rdquo; she said as all eyes looked Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say she covers all bases, animal, I&rsquo;m not sure about Mineral or vegetable, she keeps her options open so to speak&rdquo; said Stephanie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah said Robin, Max did mention a dog and pony show&rdquo; as Veronica blushed crimson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well he will only need the pony then, he&rsquo;s got the Dog already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so&rdquo; said Stephanie as she gave her mobile number to Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You there Max, you seem quite for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No all good I was just wondering whether to get another Dog, I really wouldn&rsquo;t want to put too much strain on me old Charlie Dog.&rdquo; As I put more chicken salad on my plate. Sometimes you just can&rsquo;t worry too much.</p>
<p>After Stephanie stopped laughing, she added, &ldquo;Glen Taylor was in the Bistro today big noting as usual, about some big land deal he&rsquo;s doing with the MacKinnons out at the Five Mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks Stephi Got to go&rdquo; cutting her of.</p>
<p>Klaus and I looked at each other &ldquo;Fuck&rdquo; we said, the universal adjective that fits any occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dam Fuck and Dam&rdquo; I added covering all bases.</p>
<p>I stood up and moved into the lounge carrying the aerial map of the Five Mile. &ldquo;Your here&rdquo; I said to Klaus as I marked the area with the pencil &ldquo;MacKinnons are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there as well, they have two titles&rdquo; said Klaus pointing to the other side of the river.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That parcel they bought from Barney Reynolds,&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep&rdquo; said Klaus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barney&rsquo;s property borders both sides of the river and up to National Park doesn&rsquo;t it&rdquo; I asked, handing him pencil so Klaus could mark it out. &ldquo;How big an area you reckon including yours&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a guess I&rsquo;d say Nineteen Hundred to Two Thousand give or Take?&rdquo; why</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough room for a house&rdquo; I asked as the girls filed in to see what was going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a tight squeeze, but yea you could fit a house on their&rdquo; Klaus shook his head laughing.</p>
<p>The girls looked at the area we had marked out &ldquo;Jesus, Anna said, that&rsquo;s nearly all the Five Mile&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep and I&rsquo;m about to shove it up Glen Taylor&rsquo;s Arse, all in one Go&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good &ldquo;said Klaus &ldquo;I hope it fucking kills him&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Glen Taylor had bought Klaus real estate business, and then promptly screwed him on the deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you owe him to clear your Franchise Debt, so you can sell again without paying him commission&rdquo; I asked Klaus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred and Sixty Eight Thousand give or take, why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Three Hundred and seventy should see you clear,&rdquo; asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep&rdquo; he nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got his bank details handy Klaus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep&rdquo; he nodded once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch and learn how the really rich can fuck you over&rdquo; I said while giving Klaus a hug.</p>
<p>I picked up the phone and pressed call&quot;Nigel Handrey speaking, how may I assist You Mr Adams&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nigel could you please deposit Three hundred and Eighty thousand into this account for me please, As I gave him the number, and I will have some other matters later on this evening as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will that be all you require?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the Moment, Thank You Nigel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Welcome sir, have a pleasant evening goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest just stood mouths agape looking at each other in stunned silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said before and I&rsquo;ll say it again to you all now. This is the First Division Folks it doesn&rsquo;t get any bigger than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Klaus grab three contracts, you&rsquo;ll come with me to the MacKinnons, and well get this sorted, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You girls help your Mothers to get this cleaned up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie your doing research with Professor Barnard right, how&rsquo;s that going,&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was going OK but they have cut our funding because the Americans are doing the same sought off research&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang on because they are on the same track they cut your funding, that&rsquo;s fucking moronic&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty much what the Prof said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like the Professor, know his stuff, open to new ideas&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea he&rsquo;s not bad normally, but he&rsquo;s really upset at the moment about the funding. Why&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did they take off him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;60 Mill&rdquo;, he replied looking perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch that&rsquo;s got to Hurt, How much do you reckon you would need to have a really good crack at it? Ballpark, OK&rdquo; I asked Willie. Willie replied saying, &ldquo;I heard him say once if he had the proper funding and facilities he could solve it, all he needed was about One hundred Million and a free run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK that&rsquo;s Doable, Put a proposal together for me to look at with Costing for equipment etc OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rdquo; said Willie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep No time like the present, Willie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helena I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Max.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab me all the info you can find on the uses of Molly with superconductors OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep to that as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls give her hand with the research,&rdquo; I said looking at Veronica and Inga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Big Girls have a look at Building plans with 30 beds plus for me, costing as well, there are some good sites in the states you can use, OK Ranch style High ceilings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a Kiss you lot, we have got to go, Have you the MacKinnons Number, Klaus, Good, lets rock and roll. Buddy and have some fun&rdquo;. I kissed all my girls and all of Klaus&rsquo;s as well. As we headed out to the car I asked Robin, &ldquo;Robbie who&rsquo;s Veronica&rsquo;s Father&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grant Whitney&rdquo; she answered softly.</p>
<p>Grant Whitney, the Toorak Whitney&rsquo;s. He was drug dealing, cheating low life, now thankfully, dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&rdquo; I said stopping now I understand why you didn&rsquo;t tell her before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moo&rdquo; I said looking at Veronica on the veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Maxie&rdquo; said Veronica as she finally closed her mouth at the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to be Veronica Adams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came running out and Said While raining kisses &ldquo;Call me late for Breakfast if you Like Max&rdquo; as long as I&rsquo;m with you, I don&rsquo;t care what I&rsquo;m called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Ethel I will see you when I get Back OK, You girls keep your pussies damp for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Max&rdquo; they chorused.</p>
<p>Anna came out clutching the rolled up map, &ldquo;you might need this&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks Mum&rdquo; I said as I kissed her.</p>
<p>Anna walked over to Klaus; kissed him saying, &ldquo;Go get em tiger, love you&rdquo; she smiled at us both. &ldquo;Go on now bugger off, someone has to do the work round here.&rdquo; She said to us through the car window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bugger you, Mrs If you&rsquo;re not careful,&rdquo; I said looking at Klaus shaking my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promises, promises&rdquo; she said walking back towards the house laughing.</p>
<p>As I pulled out of the gate to drive to the MacKinnons, &ldquo;about Anna buddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max he said if Anna wants you to fuck her fuck her, you two have been beating around the bush for years, it&rsquo;s OK. Besides, I owe her one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rachel&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Rachel Williams was Klaus assistant, big tits, big mouth, and small brain. I looked at him with my eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep&rdquo; was all he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buddy I told you she was dud fuck, but did you listen, No, the old &ldquo;Klaus a nater&rdquo; just went on ahead, same with your esteemed business associate Mr Taylor, once again full steam, anything else in the pipeline I should Know about, Not planning WW Three are we&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Stephanie was right, you are a shit&rdquo;. He said as he looked out the window. &ldquo;But you are my best friend, and I am so happy about you and Inga, that girl just worships the ground you walk on, take care of my baby girl OK Max.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me I just laughed and smiled &ldquo;First thing next week Inga&rsquo;s got date with a tattooist, I&rsquo;m getting a Health Care warning tattooed above her Fanny stating, &ldquo;Use with extreme Caution, Dangerous Contents Below&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re asking ME to take care of HER. You are a very funny man&rdquo; as we looked at each other and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get one for Anna, as well then&rdquo; he said which dam near caused me to hit a tree I was laughing that hard.</p>
<p>I slowed down as we turned into the MacKinnons property, as we crested the rise leading down the house below, I turned to Klaus, &ldquo;God I had forgotten how beautiful this place was, give Sara a bell to let her know were coming to visit&rdquo; as I pulled over to admire the view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK&rdquo; as Klaus talked to Sara I could see the evening shadows fall over the hill on the other side of the river, &ldquo;Wow&rdquo; was all I could say as Klaus looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes it&rsquo;s Beautiful, but we better hurry if we want to ambush the bad guys&rdquo; as we could see headlights approaching over the Five Mile Bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Park around the back, said Klaus out of sight OK&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As we pulled up, the back door opened and Sara Mackinnon appeared at the door, saying &ldquo;What brings you two gentlemen here at this time of the day, social or business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit of both&rdquo; I said kissing her on the cheek I hoping to save you from the Barbarians&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well your too late, were already here&rdquo; said a Voice from the kitchen Glen Taylor stood smirking at us as we entered the room, I stuck my hand for him to shake he took it instinctively, I pulled him off balance, kicked him in the balls and punched him as he went down, sporting no, fucking effective hell yea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Alex&rdquo; I said how are you&rdquo;. Alex being well mannered replied &ldquo;Well thank you, and you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good really good&rdquo;. I saw a contract on the table picked it up looked at the figure tore it half and put it into the open fire. Before he or anyone could say something, &ldquo;did his lordship tell you they are going to turn your place into Suburbia and destroy it&rdquo; They both shook their heads. &ldquo;No, didn&rsquo;t think so, ask Klaus, if you don&rsquo;t believe me&rdquo; As Alex&rsquo;s son Hamish came into the house accompanied by three suits. &ldquo;Hi Hamish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here dad?&rdquo; he asked, as he saw Glen on the floor, still clutching his balls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what they are planning to do to your Dads Property, Yes or No Hamish?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are going to make it a high end acreage estate,&rdquo; said Hamish looking at his Father then me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many blocks did you see on that draft plan Klaus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;45 hundred&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullshit Hamish answered back I&rsquo;ve seen the plan and it&rsquo;s only a 100 lots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all academic anyway said one of the suits we have signed contracts&rdquo; he said smirking.</p>
<p>Which was really the wrong thing to say as Alex was just about ready to explode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this true Glen?&rdquo; he said looking down, and if you lie to me I&rsquo;ll kick you in the balls as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;-said Glen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Fucking Sweet Mary and Joseph&rdquo;, he roared punching the nearest suit flush on the chin, pole axing him, Hamish decked the other, and the third offered up the contracts, which went promptly into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you Gentlemen care for a drink?&rdquo; asked Sara holding a Silver platter with Glasses and Beers on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you Sara&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes please said Klaus, I think Glen might need some Ice for his balls&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&rdquo; she replied smiling getting an ice pack from the freezer and handing it to, Glen Sitting on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Fun&rdquo; I said looking at Alex. Who was rubbing his knuckles, Sara passed him an ice pack to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rdquo; I said to Alex as I rolled out the map, I&rsquo;ve already got Klaus&rsquo;s place&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You swore you would never sell it Klaus&rdquo; said Alex starting to bristle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry Alex, my Mistake, leased it, I have to marry Inga, and he&rsquo;s forcing me to make love to Anna, the things I have to do to get deals done,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s making you do what,&rdquo; he said ready to go off again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down Alex and have another Drink&rdquo;, said Sara, &ldquo;Inga&rsquo;s been Mooning after Max, for God knows how many years, and as for Anna you are a very lucky man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you Mame&rdquo; I said smiling.</p>
<p>The head suit finally regained some sought of Composure saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be hearing from my lawyers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You three sit down and shut the fuck up, or I&rsquo;ll take all of you swimming with an anchor round your neck&rdquo;. They shut up and sat. Me I picked up his Business card looking at the company Name Landmark Property Investments Melbourne.</p>
<p>In addition, made a call &ldquo;Nigel here Mr Adams how may I be of assistance, I read out the company name, and asked Public or Private&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its public sir&rdquo;, he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much would I need to spend to short the stock and leave a smoking ruin, ballpark,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best guess 300 to 400 Million&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you hang on please Nigel&rdquo; Looking over at the people concerned, &ldquo;your call fellers&rdquo; is there a problem, No.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK Nigel&rdquo; just wondering, &ldquo;Hold on for second could you please Nigel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem, Mr Adams&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alex how does how does 8 Mill sound for your place with a signed undertaking it will not be developed, an Ill chuck in 2 Mill for Hamish to buy the Farm he&rsquo;s always wanted out west near my sisters place, happy with that&rdquo;, Alex Nodded after looking at Sara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nigel, how is Landmark traveling? Are they OK or do they need some assistance, without breaking propriety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you sir, they are quite over leveraged and I have heard they may have to divest themselves of some of their properties&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other than that, how&rsquo;s the company?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good sir, cash flows are stable and they have a substantial property portfolio,&rdquo; replied Nigel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if one were to assist in there deleveraging, the return would be OK&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very Sir&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roughly what sought of deleveraging would one need to look at, best guess?&rdquo; I asked laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d guess in the vicinity off 40 million or there about, Sir,&rdquo; said Nigel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah I said any news as to when the rest of my iceberg is arriving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to be arriving next week&rdquo;. He answered laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you Nigel could you please deposit the funds Directly into Mr and Mrs MacKinnons accounts. I&rsquo;ll put Mrs MacKinnon on to provide you with the details, Thank you Nigel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Welcome sir,&rdquo; he said as I passed Sara the phone.</p>
<p>I looked over at the suits and down a Glen, &ldquo;OK fellers here how it&rsquo;s going to go, Cross me on this and it will get ugly, really ugly.&ldquo;Now Glen you&rsquo;re from Melbourne correct, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Max&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Now work for Klaus, &ldquo;Schmitt, Adams and Taylor&rdquo; &ldquo;SAT Investments&rdquo; a private investment group&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to provide funding for Landmark a sum to be advised&rdquo;, yes, I said looking at the suits. As they looked at each other stunned, and nodded back. We will obliviously have seats on the board the makeup and number will be mutually agreeable yes. Good all sorted&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also Glen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Max.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divorce that Barbie doll you&rsquo;re married to, She&rsquo;s been fucking the help and they have knocked her up. OK&rdquo; don&rsquo;t just take my word ask Sara?&quot; I added. Sara nodded. &ldquo;Sorry Glen He&rsquo;s right&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were me Id Marry Serena, before you say anything, she&rsquo;s your, Stepdaughter, She loves you, God knows why, and a least her tits are real, and way better looking, am I right fellers&rdquo; a chorus of yes&rsquo;s confirmed my observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a bad bloke at heart, my kids like you and they are a pretty good judges of character, just be yourself and don&rsquo;t try so hard, sorry about your nuts, nah not that sorry, Sorry&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As well all broke up laughing, I went over to introduce myself, and Klaus to our new business partners. We were all having another beer when I said to Hamish, &ldquo;Ham&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea Max&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you see other properties up around that way, get Narelle to give me a yell OK&rdquo;. Narelle was my younger sister who owned and was running a Sheep property out west. She had gone out on her own with her Husband Terry producing ultra fine merino wool for the fashion market, they been advised against it by their bank and I had funded them in a 60 / 40 partnerships it had bled money for years, but in the last 6 years they were making serious money.</p>
<p>With my fashion contacts in Milan they were able to forward sell direct, helping their cash flow and expenses, they were wanting to expand I couldn&rsquo;t see that would be a problem now.</p>
<p>Sara took me aside to thank me for helping them out, she said, &ldquo;God men are such weird creatures they beat the hell out of each other then have a beer and laugh, what on earth you were talking about icebergs, and such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sold the money pit,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Max I&rsquo;m so happy&rdquo; she said giving me a hug, Alex looked over at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max sold the Money pit she said&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, Id would have sold it years ago&rdquo; Alex said.</p>
<p>I had had previous offers, which Matt and I had rejected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do OK,&rdquo; he asked as the others listened in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea&rdquo; I said smiling I did OK Klaus started laughing,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Alex looking perplexed?</p>
<p>I looked at Klaus and Nodded as he said &ldquo;if you can call $54 billion OK&rdquo;, as Alex had a mouthful of beer go out his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck, Klaus I didn&rsquo;t know that was catching&rdquo;. The suits as well as Glen looked stunned. You don&rsquo;t bring a knife to a gunfight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry folks we must away Maidens to Ravish, and country&rsquo;s to conquer.&rdquo; I said kissing Sara Hugging Alex and Hamish. Shook hands with the suits, pretended to kick Glen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glen sorry about Wendy (his Barbie Doll) wife it&rsquo;s all around town buddy, &ldquo;Yea it will get ugly and expensive, we will work something out so you don&rsquo;t get to badly screwed,&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t say anything about this OK just Say Sara wouldn&rsquo;t sign, you know how stubborn she can be&rdquo;.</p>
<p>They all laughed at that even the suits, she was good people. In addition, Gentlemen Mum is the word until it we get figures etc OK.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Max not a problem&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Me I was looking forward to resting my weary head not to mention my weary Prick and Balls as well. I looked at Sara and Alex &ldquo;you can stay as long as you need to get what you&rsquo;re doing sorted, wait till you see the plans I&rsquo;m doing for the new house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How big is it?&rdquo; asked Sara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the house, I deadpanned smiling, 30 plus beds or so&rdquo;, awaiting the expected liquid projections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just How many people are going to live their?&rdquo; asked Sara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me plus my Girls, Inga, and Veronica and Robin Masters&rdquo;, I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got three women,&rdquo; Sara said amazement showing in her voice,</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a start I said&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many do you need then?&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know enough to have 20 or 30 kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might offer Sara&rdquo;, said Alex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think even I could afford her&rdquo;, I laughed. Sara looked at me smiling &ldquo;You sir, are a Gentleman&rdquo;, and turning to Alex, &ldquo;You sir, are on rations&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our Max said Klaus spreading cheer and good will among the kind folk of Hastings&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you later Alex, Sara; keep in touch OK good Night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We walked out to the car &ldquo;that went well,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Klaus shook his head laughing, &ldquo;You sure don&rsquo;t do things by half, do you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me I just smiled &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about you but I&rsquo;m looking forward to a bit of a rest and an early night&rdquo;.</p>
<p>How wrong I was to be on both counts.</p>
