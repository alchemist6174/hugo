  "articleBody": "I am dreaming that a post-Ridgemont pre-Rush Jennifer Jason Leigh is blowing me. Just as I am about to cum, I realize this isn’t a dream. I open my eyes and see my little granddaughter Stephanie sucking my cock. The sight is too much for me and I blow my load deep down her throat. She swallows it like the little pro her mother made her. God, I have to stop this.\nI am not really much of a Christian, but I need all the help I can get right now. One of the churches in town keeps sticking their newsletter in my mailbox. I glanced at the first one and round-filed the rest. I seem to remember they had a “Parents without Partners” group. That’s what I need, some nice desperate single mom who can help me with Steph, and help me take my mind off her.\nI wash Stephanie then set her in front of some breakfast. I grab the paper on the lawn and notice today is Sunday after all. I flip thru the paper over my coffee and pass Steph the comics. The Metro section includes the local church directory. Yup, the Unity Church was listed as being out by the highway. From what I remember of their newsletters, they didn’t sound too Christian. I check my watch, only 9:30, plenty of time to get to their 11 o’clock.\n“Hey, darling,” I say to Steph, “How would you like to dress up this morning and go to church with me?” She likes the first half of that sentence, but makes a face at the word church.\n“Momma says kurch was for idi..idi..its.”\n“Now, now, have you ever been to church?” She shook her head. “I thought not. Come on, it’ll be fun.”\nShe really does like getting dressed up. She tries on just about everything we bought yesterday, before finally settling on a cute pink dress, white tights and patent leather shoes.\nWe make it to church with only a minute to spare. There isn’t time to sort out the Sunday school classes, so I just sit in the last pew with Steph next to me. Steph likes the singing and ignores the rest. Halfway thru the service she’s leaning against me, asleep. I don’t blame her, the minister is droning on about peace and justice and the God’s way or something. As she dozes, Steph keeps putting her little hand in my lap and squeezing my cock. It feels good, but the last place I want to get caught is in church. Then again, Stephanie is probably not the first abused child within these hallowed walls. I keep picking up her little hand and putting it back in her own lap. I hide my growing erection from all of this by leafing thru the printed service. I see they do have a Parents without Partners meeting that this coming Tuesday night.\nSteph manages to keep her hands to her own crotch for the rest of the service. My cock deflates as I read about the various church committees and ministries, circling the minister’s phone number. Finally I pocket the service.\nSteph wakes up for the final hymn pretty bleary eyed. I lean down and whisper, “That wasn’t so bad was it?” She shrugs and yawns. “How about some ice cream?” She nods grinning at the suggestion. I want to make church as fun as possible for her, so I am not above a little bribery.\nI pick her up and I shake the minister’s hand as we file out of the church. He’s a young guy with a big smile for everyone. “I quite like your little church here,” I tell him. “Can I call you tomorrow about joining?”\n“Absolutely, just call the church office. I’ll be in all day.”\nMonday I call into my office and try to tell my secretary Moira to reschedule my appointments for later in the week. Moira grumbles, but does as I asked. Moira really runs the company. She’s a solid middle-aged woman who knows the value of a full time job with benefits, especially in this economy. I could get a pretty young thing that only knew how to file her nails and suck my cock. I’ve met a lot of those arm candy “personal assistants” hanging on my fellow members of the Chamber of Commerce. The one time I took Moira out to lunch for Secretary’s Day, she made it clear ours was strictly a business relationship. I know I couldn’t run my little export import business without her, so I keep her, or perhaps she keeps me.\nThe meeting with the minister was a boring and fairly uneventful, even though I took Steph with me. Steph picked out a cute little yellow dress this morning and some nice white panties. She tried to pick a black thong, but I didn’t want to give the minister too much of an eyeful.\nI had tried to get a baby sitter, but it was the middle of the school day and I didn’t want to dump Steph at some random daycare center. The church has a little Christian school, but Steph clings to me and cries when I try to drop her off at their preschool. She sits in my lap squirming on my hardening cock but I don’t respond. She eventually dozes off as the minister and I speak the usual membership crap. He’s a little too eager to talk about tithing, but I tell him my business is just getting by in this down economy. He seems rather disappointed that I won’t bankroll the new roof, but that’s his problem. Stephanie lightly snoring in my lap reminds me of why I’m there, so I sign up and even agree to be on the Building Committee.\nThe Minister does confirm the Parents without Partners meeting on Tuesday, so it wasn’t a complete waste of time. He says parents usually brought their kids and that both Steph and I are welcome to visit. By this time, Steph had started to wake up and squirm in my lap, giving me a bit of a hard on again. I thank the minister for his time and leave before Steph could get me, or my cock, in serious trouble.\nAs soon as we got to the car, Stephanie unbuckles her car seat and crawls in to the front. Her nimble little hands immediately go to my crotch, unzipping my slacks. I have to slow her down before she gets me arrested for all manner of felonies. “Just wait til we get home, darling.” I zip myself up and carry her around the car to put her back in her car seat. I have to hold her in front of me to hide my growing erection, which isn’t helped by her grinding her cute little ass into it. When we finally get going I see her hands are up her dress and down her panties playing with herself.\nSeeing my little four year old granddaughter play with herself in the rear view mirror is almost too much for me. I’m stroking myself thru my slacks as Steph slides her panties down her tiny legs and kicks them off. She spreads her legs obscenely and rubs her little clit with one hand, while almost fisting herself with the other. She is such a distraction, moaning away in the back seat, I almost hit two other cars and a telephone pole as I try to drive home. It’s a miracle I didn’t get pulled over.\nWhen we get home, I pull into the garage in the back, but don’t get out of the car. I’d love to go park on some lover’s lane with my new girl, but she truly is a girl and this is the middle of the day. Steph clambers into the front seat when she sees I’m not going anywhere. This time, I let her unzip me and fish out my now raging hard on. She engulfs it in one deep gulp and suck me like the preschool professional that she is. I lean the seat back and let her do her work.\nMy mind goes back to the last time I had sex in a car. It must be decades now, I’ve never been one to pick up whores from street corners. Ah, yes, it was Jo Anne Turner from college. We were lab partners in biology class. I was tutoring her in biology and math, and she was tutoring me in blow jobs and fucking.\nStephanie’s moaning brings me back to the present. As she sucks me, she is stroking my cock with one hand and playing with herself with the other. I reach down and slide two fingers up her hot slick cunt and she immediately cums hard. While she cums, I pick up her spasming little body and drop her on my throbbing hard cock. She wails in ecstasy as my cock splits her quivering cunt, driving deep inside her. Her clenching cunt muscles massage my dick in waves as she cums again and again. I cum hard without even moving inside her. My spurting rod fills her with my incestuous seed, driving her to yet another orgasm.\nShe collapses, still impaled, and mumbles “I love you, Branka,” before passing out in my arms. My little granddaughter is much better than Jo Anne ever was.\n",

<p>I had tried to get a baby sitter, but it was the middle of the school day and I didn&rsquo;t want to dump Steph at some random daycare center. The church has a little Christian school, but Steph clings to me and cries when I try to drop her off at their preschool. She sits in my lap squirming on my hardening cock but I don&rsquo;t respond. She eventually dozes off as the minister and I speak the usual membership crap. He&rsquo;s a little too eager to talk about tithing, but I tell him my business is just getting by in this down economy. He seems rather disappointed that I won&rsquo;t bankroll the new roof, but that&rsquo;s his problem. Stephanie lightly snoring in my lap reminds me of why I&rsquo;m there, so I sign up and even agree to be on the Building Committee.</p>
<p>The Minister does confirm the Parents without Partners meeting on Tuesday, so it wasn&rsquo;t a complete waste of time. He says parents usually brought their kids and that both Steph and I are welcome to visit. By this time, Steph had started to wake up and squirm in my lap, giving me a bit of a hard on again.

She is such a distraction, moaning away in the back seat, I almost hit two other cars and a telephone pole as I try to drive home. It&rsquo;s a miracle I didn&rsquo;t get pulled over.</p>
<p>When we get home, I pull into the garage in the back, but don&rsquo;t get out of the car. I&rsquo;d love to go park on some lover&rsquo;s lane with my new girl, but she truly is a girl and this is the middle of the day. Steph clambers into the front seat when she sees I&rsquo;m not going anywhere. This time, I let her unzip me and fish out my now raging hard on. She engulfs it in one deep gulp and suck me like the preschool professional that she is. I lean the seat back and let her do her work.</p>
<p>My mind goes back to the last time I had sex in a car. It must be decades now, I&rsquo;ve never been one to pick up whores from street corners. Ah, yes, it was Jo Anne Turner from college. We were lab partners in biology class. I was tutoring her in biology and math, and she was tutoring me in blow jobs and fucking.</p>
<p>Stephanie&rsquo;s moaning brings me back to the present. As she sucks me, she is stroking my cock with one hand and playing with herself with the other. I reach down and slide two fingers up her hot slick cunt and she immediately cums hard. While she cums, I pick up her spasming little body and drop her on my throbbing hard cock. She wails in ecstasy as my cock splits her quivering cunt, driving deep inside her. Her clenching cunt muscles massage my dick in waves as she cums again and again. I cum hard without even moving inside her. My spurting rod fills her with my incestuous seed, driving her to yet another orgasm.</p>
<p>She collapses, still impaled, and mumbles &ldquo;I love you, Branka,&rdquo; before passing out in my arms. My little granddaughter is much better than Jo Anne ever was.</p>
