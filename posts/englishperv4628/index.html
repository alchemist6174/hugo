  "articleBody": "Sean was beginning to find it an interesting kind of self-discipline and restraint: giving Hannah early bedtimes and longer periods of respite from her intensive sexual experiences with he and Dan. Dan seemed to know what he was doing and, after that Wednesday evening ‘session’, the little ’talk he wanted to have with Sean proved very interesting indeed. ‘Expanding their interests’, Dan called it. As 9-year-old Hannah retired - or was ‘allowed’ to retire - to bed at 9pm to sleep off the latest fuck of her mouth and adult male attentions on her little bottom, the two men chatted. The main subject of this was ’the third man’: no, not the old movie, but an old friend of Dan’s whom he kept vaguely in contact with.\n“Well, okayyy,” said Sean, cautiously, while sipping from his beer can. “Who is he exactly, and what’s your connection with him?” Sean had no reservations about exposing Hannah to another guy, only that it was obviously another rapid step up bringing with it security issues.\n“I was his daughter’s boyfriend for a time, ‘bout 10 years ago,” Dan explained. “During my teacher-training year and then my induction year, then we broke up. I stayed email and now Facebook friends with him, though, especially when we realised we both had pedo interests.”\n“Right. Damn, so how old is he?”\n“A bit older than us, obviously. ‘Bout 65 now I think. Any problem with that?”\n“Not at all. Would be interesting.”\n“I’m pretty sure he still has a big enough libido, if that’s what you’re wondering,” said Dan with a chuckle.\n“Not really. I’ve heard of a good many pedos that age, and very active at that.”\n“Well, okay, but he’s not ‘active’ as such, in that he doesn’t have any girl he has his hands on currently, as far as I know…”\n“But?”\n“But he’s active in the sense he has lots of pics and vids as a big hobby, and I’m pretty sure he’d be interesting in becoming ’literally’ active with Hannah: she’s his type.”\n“Okay. Well, she’d be ANY pedo’s type.” Sean mused over his Hannah’s pale-faced, brunette looks and cute smooth body and her age of 9 - all of which put her in that undoubted category known as ‘a pedo’s dream’. “But what do we get in return for offering him time with Hannah?”\n“We get to share his collection, which I promise you is very very good -all levels of CP, all ages of girl, including candids - but also… and this is just a maybe…”\n“Go on.”\n“He has a step-grandaughter named Abigail, age 10,” continued Dan. “Now he does not touch her - but he’d love to - but he does get nice candid pics of her at times, and might… just might… be able to work some way for us to get a shot at her.”\n“What’s she look like, this ‘Abigail’?”\n“Not as good-looking as Hannah, but sexy in her own way. Good body, skinny with slight curves developing, cute way of smiling, long brunette with a slightly red shade…”\n“Okay, okay, so she’d be plenty good enough. But what are the chances?”\n“Not great. The porn collection is the main offer. Bill himself -that’s his name - would not want to risk getting involved, but he says he might be able to fix it for us to ‘intercept’ her for a few hours… take her somewhere discrete and… you know…”\n“What exactly? asked Sean, ever the pragmatic child-abuser.\n“Anything, within reason: penetration, all holes, but he would want her returned in one piece and nothing to connect the ‘incident’ to him whatsoever.”\n“Okay. And the CP collection: be more specific.”\n“Okay,” said Dan. “Be my guest…” He handed Sean a clinical bulleted list printed on A4 paper. “This is everything that’s in it. Bill emailed it to me last night.”\nSean read through it, occasionally raising his eyebrows. Of course, there was nothing that he had not heard of before or that shocked him, but some of it was pretty rare to actually get one’s hands on:\nNudist camp poses, natural all angles ages 5-18. Legal. Bill’s own candid photography of public swimming pool girls. Bill’s candids of Abigail including upskirts, bikini and nude in the bath. Asian CP ages 5-15, many unique/candid from his own visits to Thailand. 300 cock-sucking and mouth-cum shots of girls age 3-10. 200 anal penetrations \u0026 anal cumshots of girls 5-13. 500 pussy penetrations and cumshots ages 4-10. ALL the ‘babyQ’, ‘Nicky’, ‘Laura’ and ‘Zara’ vids. Hour-long vid of pretty American 8yo scared and crying during gang abuse. Same 8yo blindfolded and sobbing while getting ass-fucked. 30-min real daddy eating and missionary-fucking his 14yo daughter. Cam footage collection of various girls U-13 exposing themselves. HQ 30-mins of Bill’s session with sexy 13yo Mexican child-prostitute. 10yo cute Japanese girl spanked and mouth cunt raped by 2 uncles. 6yo pretty Russian coaxed into pussy-eating her own mother for 20mins. Bill vid of himself ass-fucking 12yo boy (he was a scout leader for a time). V.realistic 3D drawing storyline of the imagined pedo-ring fate of famous real-life English blonde 4yo girl who disappeared on holiday in Spain a few years ago. “Okay, okayyy,” drawled Sean, intently. “Good stuff. Not sure about the gay bit, but I’d be curious to see how that looks and works.”\n“It’s all high quality,” said Dan, “and I’ve seen the ‘Katherine’ complilation: very believable and very graphic. At the end of it you’d really feel sorry for the actual girl, if this was indeed her fate.” Dan cleared his throat as he talked. “4 is a bit young for me, mind, whoever the girl is…”\n“Okay. Not for me, but anyway… I guess the last question is… what would Bill want with Hannah exactly, and how often?”\n“He asks for 3 or 4 hours with her, to do anything he wishes ‘within reason’, with or without your supervision. In return we can freely and randomly view his entire collection. We take it from there, and further down the line discuss the chances of getting Abigail or other ways he might ‘pay’ you for continued fun with Hannah.”\n“Okay. I have no issue with that, in principle. What do you think his style would be with Hannah?”\nDan chuckled. “He’d be grandfatherly with her, loving - kind of like I am with her, but fully wanting to do the hard stuff such as cum in her mouth and throat.”\n“Well, she’s used to that,” said Sean. “I don’t think a third guy will change her attitude too much.”\n“Me neither. A kid does have a breaking point, though, so we need to keep an eye on her.”\n“Of course, Mr teacher.” The two men laughed.\nDan went on: “I think Bill would see her as an ‘Abigail substitute’, with Hannah filling the role of everything he dreams of doing with Abigail but can’t for family reasons. Hell, he might even want to roleplay the whole thing, using Abigail’s name and clothing even at times.”\n“Fascinating,” said Sean.\n“Yes, it is. He’ll be equally fascinated to watch us two in action with Hannah too.”\n“I really hope we can get a shot at his Abigail. I’ll push that with him,” said Sean.\n“Me too. She’s a cutie, and never-touched yet, so it would be sweet.”\n“Ha! I like the way you think!” said Sean. A first-time child with no sexual experience whatsoever was always the ultimate delicacy. “You’re getting as bad as me.”\n“Um, not yet,” chuckled Dan.\n“So, let’s fix up a day for Bill to visit our precious little Hannah.”\nTHE END\n‘Dan’ and ‘Bill’ started out as readers of the story, but wanted to get involved as characters in it. You can do the same! Email me with details of your character and any backstory he has, and his desires and ideas for Hannah or any new girl he might want to introduce. Your involvement would have to start after the part the whole series has reached at the time of your ‘application’.\n",

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all high quality,&rdquo; said Dan, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve seen the &lsquo;Katherine&rsquo; complilation: very believable and very graphic. At the end of it you&rsquo;d really feel sorry for the actual girl, if this was indeed her fate.&rdquo; Dan cleared his throat as he talked. &ldquo;4 is a bit young for me, mind, whoever the girl is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Not for me, but anyway&hellip; I guess the last question is&hellip; what would Bill want with Hannah exactly, and how often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asks for 3 or 4 hours with her, to do anything he wishes &lsquo;within reason&rsquo;, with or without your supervision. In return we can freely and randomly view his entire collection. We take it from there, and further down the line discuss the chances of getting Abigail or other ways he might &lsquo;pay&rsquo; you for continued fun with Hannah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I have no issue with that, in principle. What do you think his style would be with Hannah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan chuckled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be grandfatherly with her, loving - kind of like I am with her, but fully wanting to do the hard stuff such as cum in her mouth and throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s used to that,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a third guy will change her attitude too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me neither. A kid does have a breaking point, though, so we need to keep an eye on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Mr teacher.&rdquo; The two men laughed.</p>
<p>Dan went on: &ldquo;I think Bill would see her as an &lsquo;Abigail substitute&rsquo;, with Hannah filling the role of everything he dreams of doing with Abigail but can&rsquo;t for family reasons. Hell, he might even want to roleplay the whole thing, using Abigail&rsquo;s name and clothing even at times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fascinating,&rdquo; said Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. He&rsquo;ll be equally fascinated to watch us two in action with Hannah too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really hope we can get a shot at his Abigail. I&rsquo;ll push that with him,&rdquo; said Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too. She&rsquo;s a cutie, and never-touched yet, so it would be sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! I like the way you think!&rdquo; said Sean. A first-time child with no sexual experience whatsoever was always the ultimate delicacy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting as bad as me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, not yet,&rdquo; chuckled Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, let&rsquo;s fix up a day for Bill to visit our precious little Hannah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE END</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Dan&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bill&rsquo; started out as readers of the story, but wanted to get involved as characters in it. You can do the same! Email me with details of your character and any backstory he has, and his desires and ideas for Hannah or any new girl he might want to introduce. Your involvement would have to start after the part the whole series has reached at the time of your &lsquo;application&rsquo;.</strong></p>
