She was an excellent teacher, mostly due to the great love she had for her students. She had studied hard throughout her years in public school and then gone on to study at university, and all that time she had harbored a dark, twisted, little secret. Samantha Hargraves loved little girls. She had noticed early on that her teachers held power over all the kids in her classes, especially in the younger grades. So Samantha had become a primary school teacher and for five years no one had discovered her little games.\nSamantha had several little peccadilloes when it came to little girls and she had only tried out the least risky ones on her cuddly little charges. Samantha saw little girls like the world’s greatest stuffed animals. It had all begun when she was twelve and had first babysat her 6 year old cousin, Daisy. Daisy was a cheerful little girl, prone to hyperactivity and giggling. It had been a bright Sunday afternoon, and Daisy had been playing outside in the warm July sun.\nSamantha called Daisy in from playing and, looking the sweaty, grass-stained, little girl up and down had told her it was bath time. Daisy protested, as little kids are prone to do, and Samantha had decided to spank the little girl, just like her father did whenever Sam acted up. She grabbed Daisy around the waist and carried the screaming and kicking child upstairs and into the Bathroom. Daisy’s parents bathroom was huge, with two sinks and a Jacuzzi-style bathtub. Sam sat down on one of the two dressing benches around the tub and quickly pulling up Daisy’s sun-dress, draped the child across her knees. She asked “Gonna take a bath like I told you?”\nDaisy shook her head and, looking sulky, said “You can’t spank me, mommy will be mad at you.”\nSamantha smiled softly to herself and, without pausing to consider the trouble she might be in if Daisy told on her, began to slap each of her little cousin’s white cotton panty covered buttocks. She rained down stinging blow after stinging blow, ten to each pert little rump-cheek.\nDaisy screamed and began crying, yelling “Stoppit!” at the top of her lungs.\nSamantha realized that the neighbors might hear Daisy, if she did not find a way to make the little brat shut up. Looking wildly around her eyes fell on the white panties and she had a really naughty idea. She quickly yanked the panties down, hard, causing Daisy to squeal as the elastic dug into her tender skin.\nSam looked at the little panties, their fabric damp from little girl sweat and tiny droplets of urine. She had another naughty thought and sniffed them quickly, taking in the sweetish, musky smell, before she stuffed them into the protesting mouth of her six-year-old cousin.\nDaisy nearly choked as she was suddenly muzzled, and she began to cry as she realized what was stuffed into her mouth. She tried to spit it out but Sam was wadding it further into her mouth and them fixed it in place with her own hair band. She wailed as loudly as she could but all that came out was a muffled squeal.\nSam looked down and caught her breath as she gazed at the perfect smooth and glowing softly red rear of her cousin. She licked her lips and begin to spank her again, harder than before. She spanked and spanked, loosing herself in the rise and fall over her hand, in the writhing and squealing of the little girl, in the tingly between her legs at the thought of how naughty she was being. She spanked for what seemed like hours, until her cousin’s rump was bruised black and blue and her own hand was throbbing. What finally made her stop was the sudden burst of pain / pleasure as she missed the suddenly limp form of her cousin as the girl passed out and slipped out of the way, causing Sam to slap herself, hard, on her pubescent crotch. She screamed as orgasm after orgasm ripped though her, dropping the unconscious six-year-old to the hard floor as she spasmmed wildly and collapsed next to her, panting and gasping for air.\nWhen she came around, her eyes fixed on the purplish rump of the little girl and she realized that if she did not think fast, she was going to be in a lot of trouble. Sam quickly removed her clothing including her surprisingly soaked panties and the rest of Daisy’s apparel. Filling the tub with warm water she climbed in, still holding the now naked, but still unconscious child in her arms. She began to clean herself and the little girl, who came around slowly.\nDaisy gasped and whimpered as she realized that she was still with her crazy cousin. She squirmed and tried to tug away from the bigger girl. “You hurt meeeeee!” She sobbed.\nSam nodded and smiled wickedly at Daisy. “Yes I did, and If you ever, Ever!, tell anyone I will do it again, this time with a leather belt. So this is what you are gonna tell Auntie Carol, okay? You are gonna tell her you were slidding down the stairs all afternoon, okay?” All the while she was creating her cover story, Sam was softly rubbing the little girl’s naked thighs, gently and soothingly in the warm water. She waited until Daisy nodded, slowly and with tears in her eyes, but she did nod. Sam smiled and kissed Daisy’s forehead. “Kay. Now I have a reward for you cause you are being a good girl now.”\nDaisy blinked softly “Re…reward?”\nSam, who had discovered how nice a Jaccuzzi could be last summer when she had gone to Mexico with her parents, smiled and nodded as she turned the Jets on full. She spread the little girl’s legs and possitioned Daisy’s tiny little sex right over one.\nDaisy squealed and began to wriggle as tingling waves of pleasurable bubbles raced over the sensitive skin. Sam held Daisy there until the girl reached orgasm and sagged in her arms. She snuggled the little girl close and kissed her nose “Was that a good reward?” Daisy trembled and gasped for air, unable to speak, but she nodded slowly “What was that? Can we do it again? \" She asked when she finally could speak once more.\nSam grinned as a whole new bunch of naughty thoughts came into her mind. Sam inwardly marveled at the idea that Pain could be balanced by pleasure. She giggled softly as some fun ideas for games to play with her little cousin filled her thoughts.She nodded “But not tonight Daisy. Your parents are gonna be home soon. Remember what I told you know and we can do this again.” She helped the girl out of the bath and dried them both off. Dressing the girl in her PJ’s carried her down stairs and the two watched TV and ate Spagetti-o’s until Daisy’s parents came home.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Samantha Hargraves loved being a teacher, it was all she had dreamed of being since she was a little girl. She was an excellent teacher, mostly due to the great love she had for her students. She had studied hard throughout her years in public school and then gone on to study at university, and all that time she had harbored a dark, twisted, little secret.
