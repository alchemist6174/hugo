  "articleBody": "My older sister Robyn and I started sleeping together every night. It was crowded in her twin bed until our parents relented and got us a double bed. We had shared a room when we were younger, and Mom used the other bedroom as her sewing room. So since Robyn and I were fucking like bunnies every night, I just moved in kinda permanently. I left my clothes and old bed in my old room, but mom set up her sewing machine again. We ended up christening our new incestuous bed with a family orgy, luckily it had a heavy duty frame.\nWhen I get home from school the day it was delivered, Robyn and Mom are already at it. I’m not really in the mood. Mrs. Peters at school had given me all kinds of shit in Social Studies and I just want to collapse. I stand in the door watching them 69ing each other, moaning and slurping. Mom’s on top as she rub her sloppy cunt it all over Robyn’s face. Robyn has four fingers up her mother’s cunt as she sucks mom’s clit. I couldn’t see what Mom was doing to Robyn at the other end, but Robyn looks like she’s enjoying it.\nI collapse on my old bed, but listening to my sister moan and cum in the next room makes me forget all about Mrs. Peters. Soon, I am stroking my hard cock. I go next door and climb on the bed. Neither of them notices me until I pulled Robyn’s fist from my mother’s dripping cunt. Mom moans “Nooo” until I slide my cock deep inside her. Mom gasps and looks over her shoulder at me and grins. At first Mom is so loose it’s like fucking a hallway, but her cunt tightens quickly around my throbbing cock. I slam into her as Robyn continues to suck her clit. Soon, mom cums hard, her elastic cunt rippling around my cock. The wet vibrations sent me over the edge and I slammed hard into her, blowing my load deep in the my mother’s wicked cunt.\nI collapse next to them as Mom returns her attention to her daughter’s cunt. I reach over and play with both my mother’s and sister’s tits as I stroke my still hard cock. Soon my dear sister Robyn was moaning then screaming as she came with her brother’s semen dripping from our mother’s cunt all over her face.\nAs soon as Robyn calms down, Mom gets up and, finally sated, goes downstairs to start dinner. Robyn looks over and smiles, then seeing my hard cock, impales herself on me. I’m glad that Mom is gone and Robyn and I are alone. I reach up and play with her firm tits as she rides me. I pull her down to me and we kiss. I realize I love my sister like no other, that I’d do anything to protect her. Robyn slows down as we fuck like lovers, not sex crazed demons. We roll over on own new bigger bed and I slowly and deeply fuck the love of my life. I don’t care if she is my big sister. I love her more than life itself. She looks up and me with tears in her eyes and I tear up too and stop with my cock deep inside her tight sweet pussy.\n“Don’t stop, Edward,” she says. “Don’t ever stop.”\n“I won’t, Robyn. I’ll never stop loving you.”\nWe kiss deeply, our tongues communing. She tastes sweet to me and I slowly start thrusting into her again. She meets my every stroke as she wraps her legs around me and hugs me close. Her nipples brush mine as we start to pick up speed. Robyn begins to moan as she gets closer and closer to cumming. Her excitement, excites me too. I want to give the girl I love as much pleasure as I can. I want this act, this one fuck, among all of the other fucks, sucks, ass fucks, hand jobs and who can remember what we’ve had in the last weeks, to truly be making love. We stare into each other’s eyes as we make love to each other. On each stroke, I lift up a bit as I drive deep into her, sliding my cock along her g-spot, and then at bottom feeling her clit grind between us,. Her eyes get wide as I do, feeling this new technique. All of the books on anatomy I’ve been reading have paid off. I just grin down at her and pick up the pace a bit. She responds, grabbing my head and pull ing me down into another passionate kiss. Finally we break off, breathing and fucking hard. She shakes her head back and forth, writhing and screaming in orgasm. Her cunt muscles clamp down on my cock almost grabbing it fast. I’ve never felt anything so tight as I slam into her grunting twice more before I, too, explode so hard I see stars.\nWe collapse together arm in arm and cock in cunt. We drifted off, mumbling “I love yous” in each other’s ears.\n***\nI wake up later to someone sucking my cock. It’s dark outside and the lights are out. However, I recognize my mom’s mouth just from the feel on my cock. From the bouncing of the bed along with the grunting and groaning, I deduce that Dad is fucking his daughter Robyn next to me. As soon as my sore, aching cock is hard, my mother straddles me and fucks me too. The pain of my cock only adds to the pleasure as my own mother fucks me, matching the rhythm of her husband fucking his daughter. Robyn’s hand finds mine and we hold on to each other as we each service our parents most wicked, sinful desires. I hear Robyn’s breath shorten as she comes closer to cumming around her father’s cock. I am jealous of him but the sound of my sister’s obvious pleasure turns me on, too. I reach up grab my mother’s left tit, which I have come to know is the more sensitive one. As I squeeze my mother’s tit and pinch her nipple, she starts to moan and ride me harder. I slam up into my moth er’s hot wet cunt hard, matching my family’s incestuous rhythm. Robyn picks up the pace too, matching her father’s thrusts into her tight 15 year old cunt. My father loves it and grabs Robyn by the hips fucks her furiously, pulling her hand from mine. I reach down and rub my mother’s clit with my free hand and she screams cumming hard, slamming the cunt that gave birth to me down on my 12 year old cock. My mother’s screams drive my father over the edge as he slams hard into his young daughter’s tight cunt, spraying it with the same seed that made her.\nThey both climb off of their children and leaving us wet gooey messes. They grab their clothes and leave, arm in arm. My cock is raw and sore and I’m sure Robyn’s cunt isn’t much better. I reach over and Robyn is crying. I pull her to me. She reaches down between her legs and her fingers come back pink, a mixture of blood and semen. “You OK?” I ask.\n“It’s OK, I’ve had worse,” she says and buries her head in my shoulder and softly sobbing.\nI hold her as we both drift off again in our new bed.\n",
