  "articleBody": "Robert Saint, respectable 41-year-old businessman and married man, was having his favorite type of evening. He was dining out with an underage lover, enjoying the whole getting-to-know-them thing, to be followed by good honest hardcore activity later. Publicly, he passed her off as ‘Mia the daughter of his visiting Malaysian pen-pal lady’, rather than ‘Mia an 11-year-old child-whore’. Indeed, he did not like to think of her as that, but more as a little friend who he was helping. Even the pen-pal business was not entirely a lie; he frequently helped Mia mail her letters and money to her family in an impoverished Javan village. In return, Mia helped HIM, in ways that his stale marriage had long ceased to provide. The marriage probably never had a chance, in hindsight, what with HER being an almost frigid librarian and HIM being a closet pedosexual. There were no children by it, and therefore very little to tie him to England should he wish to…\n“Mia,” he said. “When you leave to go home, I would very much like to go with you.”\n“Go home… with me?” she said. Sex seemed to be a greater talent for her than learning English.\n“Yes.” He smiled.\n“You mean ’now’ home, to the house of Sean where I am being, for us to have sex?”\n“Shhh,” said Robert, glancing cautiously around the restaurant. “No. I mean Malaysia, your Java village even.”\n“Ohhh…”\n“But also home to Sean’s house tonight, yes.”\nHe put his thoughts of her skinny naked body, and aromatic brown child-flesh, on a back-burner for the moment. Sean had left him with the care of Mia tonight, because he had a ‘very important business to see to’. He would not divulge was it was but promised to tell all about it later. If it went well, it would be a ‘perfect fresh start’ for him - Sean - he said.\n“Oh, but,” began Mia, with an insight and purpose beyond her years, “when I go home I will live again with my family. I think you would not be welcome.”\n“Oh, of course. I understand.”\n“But,” she went on. Robert perked up. “In Java, I have cousin and her family who would meet you.”\n“Who would ‘meet’ me?”\n“Yes, my cousin, Leola. She 26, very much would want to meet wealthy western man, for to marry.”\n“I see.”\n“She has two daughter, age 9 and 12.”\n“I see…”\n9-year-old Elise’s time had come. Gloria, ultra-confident and sexy American lady of the oldest profession, walked her by the hand along the corridor of a high-class Ohio motel. She had done this dozens of times before with her own daughter, Mandy, and knew that brazenness was just as important as tact. They passed two guests on the stairs, an elderly couple who smiled in the kindly way people do when seeing a child on holiday with her ‘mother’. Perhaps the thought might have crossed their minds that Gloria was very dark, whilst the child was fair-skinned and blonde. If they had heard the sweet little one speak, they might have wondered also at her English accent. However, they would never dream to think that this little girl was about to be exchanged with a millionaire for the sum of $5,000.\n“So, room 23,” said Gloria, brightly. “Let’s see who finds the number first, sweetie.”\nElise gazed at the brown doors as they passed each one, the task diluting her nervous expression a little. She needn’t be nervous, however, which is what Gloria and the others had told her a hundred times. The client she had secured was as good as they came, and would not hurt her beyond the challenge of penetration. He might not even do that, such a soppy old guy he was, and may very well be content with the cuddling and fondling her little naked body throughout the night. On the other hand, it was possible he would sub-let her to a buddy for part of the night - very slick these millionaires were - but there was no way Gloria could police that. Mutual interests of self-preservation on both sides would ensure that any such buddy was a sensible type, even if a horny pedosexual. Elise found the number; Gloria had seen it first, but allowed the child to point it out with a hesitant little nod. She looked at the door, and looked at Gloria.\n“Now, Elise, darling. Remember all our training?” Elise nodded. “Would you quickly go over the six golden rules for me?”\n“Try to make good conversation, unless he asks for no talk.”\n“Yes.”\n“Give him compliments, about how he looks or how nice he is.”\n“Yes.”\n“Try my best to do anything he asks, in a good spirit.”\n“Yes.”\n“If he is hurting me, tell him politely.”\n“Yes.”\n“Try not to make noise.”\n“Yes.”\n“Never tell anybody else about us having sex.”\n“Very good, Elise. Or else what might happen?”\n“I could be taken away to an orphanage and never see anybody who loves me ever again.”\n“Correct. Now, let’s meet Mr Van Pelt. Call him that, unless he asks to be called ‘Eric’, okay?”\n“Yes.”\nGloria knocked on the door. The man who answered had tight greying curly hair, which was probably lush in his time, and he was wearing a classy type of golfing attire. Indeed, a bag of clubs was by the far wall, and his laptop was on the dresser. He was in good shape for 61, tall and tanned with only a slight overhanging belly.\n“Hey, Gloria,” he said, affectionately.\n“Hi, you old fox. Are you well?”\n“Yes, and you look as radiant as ever.”\n“I keep in shape.”\n“Oh, I know you do! Now, YOUR name must be Elise.” He smiled tenderly, kneeling to her. He held her gently just above the hips, slipping his hands slightly over her little bottom.\n“Yes,” Elise said, with a nervy chuckle.\n“Oh, God, you should have put her in a sandwich for me!” he said to Gloria.\n“Shush, you old lothario.” Footsteps and voices could be heard on the stairs. “Okay, you know the system. I’ll come here at 9.30 tomorrow morning to collect her. Have a tactful and nice time - both of you.”\n“Thanks, Gloria.” He led Elise into the room. “How’s Mandy, by the way?”\n“She’s good, and I’ll be in touch when her next availability comes up.”\n“Thank you, good Madam. Do tell me when your own is, too.”\n“Of course. Amy will soon be working too.”\n“Oh, my, now that I will be interested in.”\n“Plus, we have a 14-year-old English girl. A very nice body. Will send more info soon.”\n“Thanks, Gloria. Bye for now.”\n“Bye, Eric.”\nGloria gave Elise a quick wave and an encouraging smile. The child, standing next to Mr Van Pelt, meekly waved back before the door between them was closed. On her frightened, regal little face was also a degree of excitement. Her training was going ok, and the rest of the group was going ok.\nWhilst Mia was in the safe hands of Robert, Sean was enjoying a very important date. It was indeed that, as well as ‘business’. The 36-year-old chatted, cool and charming, to the 32-year-old woman sitting opposite him on the small table of the quality restaurant. These sort of surroundings were somewhat beyond his current means, but it created a good impression to reinforce the swagger with which he had cruised into the woman’s life. She was averagely attractive, a little overweight but nothing to gross a guy out too much, and a rough working class type. Her ex-boyfriend was serving time for robbery, and the man she had been married to before that was dead from a drugs-related shooting. ‘Hannah’ - that was her name, funnily enough - was an earthy, sexually-charged woman, and she needed a stable man in her life. Sean was willing to be that, and had made it quite clear to her thus far. It was their third date.\nAt 10 pm, it was time to leave the restaurant. She had invited Sean to her flat, his second time of going round there. This time, however, he would be staying the night and they would be fucking. This had not been said outright but, as so often with these things, a few casual references to ’the morning’ had settled it in the minds of both of them. It would be good. No airs or graces to this woman. Hell, it could almost be enough to make one give up wanting it with children, mused Sean. Well…\nHer flat was modest and, with the sale of his old place, Sean would be able to provide a good standard of living for them for some time. Further down the line, if he was still encamped there, money would come in by other means. They were 15 minutes late.\n“Hi Leanne, sorry to keep you waiting,” said Hannah.\n“Oh, it’s okay.” A 15-year-old girl emerged from the living room.\n“Has everything been okay?”\n“Yes, just fine.” Leanne was a dopey-looking creature, but very pretty with an unwashed and tangled mane of brown hair. She ran her hand self-consciously through a bit of it, in the unexpected presence of Sean.\n“Ohh, and how’s ’little Miss S’?” gushed Hannah.\nHer daughter - 8 years old - called Simone, appeared. “I’m grrrrreat! I liked getting to stay up late.”\n“Well, yer off to bed now, and don’t argue.”\n“Ohhhh.” The kid, pouting, was fucking pretty - an 8 out of 10, compared with the ‘old’ Hannah’s ‘9’ - and it was the second time Sean had seen her.\n“No arguing,” said Sean, already playing the model step-dad. “Listen to what your Mom says.”\n“Hey, no, just gimme the usual,” said Leanne, as Hannah attempted to pay her for the babysitting overtime.\n“Don’t be silly,” said Hannah. “Just cos yer my neighbour, don’t mean you shouldn’t get paid fer yer time.”\n“Yes, don’t be silly,” said Sean. He produced a ten quid note and gave it to Leanne. “Take it, or else.” He winked at her.\nLeanne laughed and blushed. Surely not a virgin, mused Sean, with her looks and in this kind of neighborhood. Whether she was or not, at that age they always melt with any tough-looking older guy. Sean decided he sincerely wanted to be giving HER a good drilling too, one day. Every bit as good as Simon’s Fiona was - ‘is’ - and her moans would be exceptional underneath a guy who knew how to fuck properly, not like the lousy teens she had probably had.\n“Thanks,” she said.\nAfter she’d gone, Simone had to be put to bed. She was already in her pyjamas. “I’m only going if Sean takes me there,” she said.\n“Okay, okay,” Hannah said, with a chuckle and a sigh. “Sean can do it. Don’t annoy him, though.”\nSean escorted the bubbly, simple-minded and trusting child to her bedroom. She really was cute. Blonde hair, held in an Alice-band, spilled down over her narrow shoulders. Her figure had kind of ’no shape’, neither skinny nor chubby for her age, and you could see it would one day become her mother. Her blue eyes were sweet, and her smile innocent yet mischievous, which spelled a type of ‘potential’ Sean knew only too well.\n“Okay, you,” he chirped. He had bonded with her superbly already from their first meet. “I will see you tomorrow. You go to sleep now like a good girl.”\n“Are you staying here?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good.”\n“Bedtime now.” He knelt down to her. “Now, I’m guessing you don’t sleep in THAT.” He lifted her headband off.\n“No, silly.” She giggled. “I only sleep in my pyjamas.”\nHmm, we’ll soon get rid of them too, mused Sean. “I know that, silly,” he said.\n“Give me a kiss,” she said.\nSean kissed her on the forehead. He also took hold of her around the buttocks, just for a few seconds, and gave them a pat. “We’re going to be very good friends, Simone. I’m going to show you my 10 favourite things in the world, one day.”\n“Oooo, wow. What are they??”\n“Never mind, now. Off you go, and lights out.”\nThe excitable but over-tired child went into her room with a last giggle. When her door was closed, Sean rolled his eyes with a sigh, and tried to forget about her pretty face, nice little mouth, puppy-fat butt and the hairless puffy slit she would no doubt have. Instead, he focused his mind on the essential duty of shagging her mother all night. All in good time… all in good time… and, hell, how was that sweet little treasure Elise doing in America?\nGloria arrived at the motel at 9.10 am, 20 minutes early. She had a hunch, which was proved right. After knocking at room 23, Eric Van Pelt came to door. A moment later, a younger man - about 40 - came out of the room, with that unique ‘satiated but guilty’ look Gloria knew very well on a guy. Despite his tidiness, he also looked like he had ’lacked sleep’, as did Eric. He muttered a brief greeting to her, before scuttling off down the corridor.\n“Um, that was a business associate of mine,” explained Eric. “He’s, uh, very trustworthy. Uh, and gentle…”\n“Okayyy,” drawled Gloria. “You should have asked permission, but never mind. How’s…”\n“Our little princess is just fine,” chirped Eric. “Here she is!”\nElise emerged, dressed and looking for all the world like any normal little 9-year-old girl on holiday. Except to the trained eye or to anybody who knew her well, she was looking paler than usual, her smile of an even meeker kind than usual, and she seemed to be walking a bit slow and gingerly.\nThe pedo ring series is now officially ended. Thank you if you have been following it. If you are new to it, look for The Pedo Ring Series Summary of Episodes under englishperv for the order. At a later date, I may write a biography of each of the characters from the series, to reveal how their full lives panned out. The further adventures of the ‘American group’, led by Gloria and comprising delightful kids Mandy and Amy can be followed under Arachnophile’s stories.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Robert Saint, respectable 41-year-old businessman and married man, was having his favorite type of evening. He was dining out with an underage lover, enjoying the whole getting-to-know-them thing, to be followed by good honest hardcore activity later. Publicly, he passed her off as &lsquo;Mia the daughter of his visiting Malaysian pen-pal lady&rsquo;, rather than &lsquo;Mia an 11-year-old child-whore&rsquo;. Indeed, he did not like to think of her as that, but more as a little friend who he was helping. Even the pen-pal business was not entirely a lie; he frequently helped Mia mail her letters and money to her family in an impoverished Javan village. In return, Mia helped HIM, in ways that his stale marriage had long ceased to provide. The marriage probably never had a chance, in hindsight, what with HER being an almost frigid librarian and HIM being a closet pedosexual. There were no children by it, and therefore very little to tie him to England should he wish to&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you leave to go home, I would very much like to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home&hellip; with me?&rdquo; she said. Sex seemed to be a greater talent for her than learning English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean &rsquo;now&rsquo; home, to the house of Sean where I am being, for us to have sex?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shhh,&rdquo; said Robert, glancing cautiously around the restaurant. &ldquo;No. I mean Malaysia, your Java village even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohhh&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But also home to Sean&rsquo;s house tonight, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his thoughts of her skinny naked body, and aromatic brown child-flesh, on a back-burner for the moment. Sean had left him with the care of Mia tonight, because he had a &lsquo;very important business to see to&rsquo;. He would not divulge was it was but promised to tell all about it later. If it went well, it would be a &lsquo;perfect fresh start&rsquo; for him - Sean - he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but,&rdquo; began Mia, with an insight and purpose beyond her years, &ldquo;when I go home I will live again with my family. I think you would not be welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she went on. Robert perked up. &ldquo;In Java, I have cousin and her family who would meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would &lsquo;meet&rsquo; me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my cousin, Leola. She 26, very much would want to meet wealthy western man, for to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has two daughter, age 9 and 12.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>9-year-old Elise&rsquo;s time had come. Gloria, ultra-confident and sexy American lady of the oldest profession, walked her by the hand along the corridor of a high-class Ohio motel. She had done this dozens of times before with her own daughter, Mandy, and knew that brazenness was just as important as tact. They passed two guests on the stairs, an elderly couple who smiled in the kindly way people do when seeing a child on holiday with her &lsquo;mother&rsquo;. Perhaps the thought might have crossed their minds that Gloria was very dark, whilst the child was fair-skinned and blonde. If they had heard the sweet little one speak, they might have wondered also at her English accent. However, they would never dream to think that this little girl was about to be exchanged with a millionaire for the sum of $5,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, room 23,&rdquo; said Gloria, brightly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who finds the number first, sweetie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elise gazed at the brown doors as they passed each one, the task diluting her nervous expression a little. She needn&rsquo;t be nervous, however, which is what Gloria and the others had told her a hundred times. The client she had secured was as good as they came, and would not hurt her beyond the challenge of penetration. He might not even do that, such a soppy old guy he was, and may very well be content with the cuddling and fondling her little naked body throughout the night. On the other hand, it was possible he would sub-let her to a buddy for part of the night - very slick these millionaires were - but there was no way Gloria could police that. Mutual interests of self-preservation on both sides would ensure that any such buddy was a sensible type, even if a horny pedosexual. Elise found the number; Gloria had seen it first, but allowed the child to point it out with a hesitant little nod. She looked at the door, and looked at Gloria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Elise, darling. Remember all our training?&rdquo; Elise nodded. &ldquo;Would you quickly go over the six golden rules for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to make good conversation, unless he asks for no talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him compliments, about how he looks or how nice he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try my best to do anything he asks, in a good spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is hurting me, tell him politely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try not to make noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never tell anybody else about us having sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Elise. Or else what might happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could be taken away to an orphanage and never see anybody who loves me ever again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct. Now, let&rsquo;s meet Mr Van Pelt. Call him that, unless he asks to be called &lsquo;Eric&rsquo;, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gloria knocked on the door. The man who answered had tight greying curly hair, which was probably lush in his time, and he was wearing a classy type of golfing attire. Indeed, a bag of clubs was by the far wall, and his laptop was on the dresser. He was in good shape for 61, tall and tanned with only a slight overhanging belly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Gloria,&rdquo; he said, affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you old fox. Are you well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you look as radiant as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep in shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you do! Now, YOUR name must be Elise.&rdquo; He smiled tenderly, kneeling to her. He held her gently just above the hips, slipping his hands slightly over her little bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Elise said, with a nervy chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God, you should have put her in a sandwich for me!&rdquo; he said to Gloria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shush, you old lothario.&rdquo; Footsteps and voices could be heard on the stairs. &ldquo;Okay, you know the system. I&rsquo;ll come here at 9.30 tomorrow morning to collect her. Have a tactful and nice time - both of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Gloria.&rdquo; He led Elise into the room. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Mandy, by the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s good, and I&rsquo;ll be in touch when her next availability comes up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, good Madam. Do tell me when your own is, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Amy will soon be working too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my, now that I will be interested in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plus, we have a 14-year-old English girl. A very nice body. Will send more info soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Gloria. Bye for now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye, Eric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gloria gave Elise a quick wave and an encouraging smile. The child, standing next to Mr Van Pelt, meekly waved back before the door between them was closed. On her frightened, regal little face was also a degree of excitement. Her training was going ok, and the rest of the group was going ok.</p>
<hr>
<p>Whilst Mia was in the safe hands of Robert, Sean was enjoying a very important date. It was indeed that, as well as &lsquo;business&rsquo;. The 36-year-old chatted, cool and charming, to the 32-year-old woman sitting opposite him on the small table of the quality restaurant. These sort of surroundings were somewhat beyond his current means, but it created a good impression to reinforce the swagger with which he had cruised into the woman&rsquo;s life. She was averagely attractive, a little overweight but nothing to gross a guy out too much, and a rough working class type. Her ex-boyfriend was serving time for robbery, and the man she had been married to before that was dead from a drugs-related shooting. &lsquo;Hannah&rsquo; - that was her name, funnily enough - was an earthy, sexually-charged woman, and she needed a stable man in her life. Sean was willing to be that, and had made it quite clear to her thus far. It was their third date.</p>
<p>At 10 pm, it was time to leave the restaurant. She had invited Sean to her flat, his second time of going round there. This time, however, he would be staying the night and they would be fucking. This had not been said outright but, as so often with these things, a few casual references to &rsquo;the morning&rsquo; had settled it in the minds of both of them. It would be good. No airs or graces to this woman. Hell, it could almost be enough to make one give up wanting it with children, mused Sean. Well&hellip;</p>
<p>Her flat was modest and, with the sale of his old place, Sean would be able to provide a good standard of living for them for some time. Further down the line, if he was still encamped there, money would come in by other means. They were 15 minutes late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Leanne, sorry to keep you waiting,&rdquo; said Hannah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; A 15-year-old girl emerged from the living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has everything been okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just fine.&rdquo; Leanne was a dopey-looking creature, but very pretty with an unwashed and tangled mane of brown hair. She ran her hand self-consciously through a bit of it, in the unexpected presence of Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohh, and how&rsquo;s &rsquo;little Miss S&rsquo;?&rdquo; gushed Hannah.</p>
<p>Her daughter - 8 years old - called Simone, appeared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m grrrrreat! I liked getting to stay up late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yer off to bed now, and don&rsquo;t argue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohhhh.&rdquo; The kid, pouting, was fucking pretty - an 8 out of 10, compared with the &lsquo;old&rsquo; Hannah&rsquo;s &lsquo;9&rsquo; - and it was the second time Sean had seen her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No arguing,&rdquo; said Sean, already playing the model step-dad. &ldquo;Listen to what your Mom says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, no, just gimme the usual,&rdquo; said Leanne, as Hannah attempted to pay her for the babysitting overtime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; said Hannah. &ldquo;Just cos yer my neighbour, don&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t get paid fer yer time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; said Sean. He produced a ten quid note and gave it to Leanne. &ldquo;Take it, or else.&rdquo; He winked at her.</p>
<p>Leanne laughed and blushed. Surely not a virgin, mused Sean, with her looks and in this kind of neighborhood. Whether she was or not, at that age they always melt with any tough-looking older guy. Sean decided he sincerely wanted to be giving HER a good drilling too, one day. Every bit as good as Simon&rsquo;s Fiona was - &lsquo;is&rsquo; - and her moans would be exceptional underneath a guy who knew how to fuck properly, not like the lousy teens she had probably had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>After she&rsquo;d gone, Simone had to be put to bed. She was already in her pyjamas. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only going if Sean takes me there,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, okay,&rdquo; Hannah said, with a chuckle and a sigh. &ldquo;Sean can do it. Don&rsquo;t annoy him, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sean escorted the bubbly, simple-minded and trusting child to her bedroom. She really was cute. Blonde hair, held in an Alice-band, spilled down over her narrow shoulders. Her figure had kind of &rsquo;no shape&rsquo;, neither skinny nor chubby for her age, and you could see it would one day become her mother. Her blue eyes were sweet, and her smile innocent yet mischievous, which spelled a type of &lsquo;potential&rsquo; Sean knew only too well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, you,&rdquo; he chirped. He had bonded with her superbly already from their first meet. &ldquo;I will see you tomorrow. You go to sleep now like a good girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you staying here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bedtime now.&rdquo; He knelt down to her. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m guessing you don&rsquo;t sleep in THAT.&rdquo; He lifted her headband off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, silly.&rdquo; She giggled. &ldquo;I only sleep in my pyjamas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hmm, we&rsquo;ll soon get rid of them too, mused Sean. &ldquo;I know that, silly,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a kiss,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Sean kissed her on the forehead. He also took hold of her around the buttocks, just for a few seconds, and gave them a pat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be very good friends, Simone. I&rsquo;m going to show you my 10 favourite things in the world, one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oooo, wow. What are they??&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, now. Off you go, and lights out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The excitable but over-tired child went into her room with a last giggle. When her door was closed, Sean rolled his eyes with a sigh, and tried to forget about her pretty face, nice little mouth, puppy-fat butt and the hairless puffy slit she would no doubt have. Instead, he focused his mind on the essential duty of shagging her mother all night. All in good time&hellip; all in good time&hellip; and, hell, how was that sweet little treasure Elise doing in America?</p>
<hr>
<p>Gloria arrived at the motel at 9.10 am, 20 minutes early. She had a hunch, which was proved right. After knocking at room 23, Eric Van Pelt came to door. A moment later, a younger man - about 40 - came out of the room, with that unique &lsquo;satiated but guilty&rsquo; look Gloria knew very well on a guy. Despite his tidiness, he also looked like he had &rsquo;lacked sleep&rsquo;, as did Eric. He muttered a brief greeting to her, before scuttling off down the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, that was a business associate of mine,&rdquo; explained Eric. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s, uh, very trustworthy. Uh, and gentle&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okayyy,&rdquo; drawled Gloria. &ldquo;You should have asked permission, but never mind. How&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our little princess is just fine,&rdquo; chirped Eric. &ldquo;Here she is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elise emerged, dressed and looking for all the world like any normal little 9-year-old girl on holiday. Except to the trained eye or to anybody who knew her well, she was looking paler than usual, her smile of an even meeker kind than usual, and she seemed to be walking a bit slow and gingerly.</p>
