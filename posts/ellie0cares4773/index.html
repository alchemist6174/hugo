  "articleBody": "You come into my room, it’s 2am. You heard me moaning and murmuring in my sleep, and it woke you up. You knew I was having a bad dream an would wake up crying soon; you sit down on the edge of my bed and attempt to brush my hair out of my face. “Sweetheart, wake up.” You lean over me and give me a kiss. “Darling its just a dream, wake up baby girl.”\n“Daddy?!” I rise to a seating position, and rub my eyes. Then, memories of the dream rush back to me and I burst into tears. “Oh daddy! I had such a bad dream” I sob, bringing my knees to my chest. The Blanket falls away, revealing my smooth little legs. My nightie had hiked up to rest around my waist during the night, and you can see my white cotton panties. You notice one of my socks is missing, and you have to keep yourself from chuckling at my bed-head.\n“I know, Duckie.” You say, cupping my tear-soaked cheek in your hand. “I came in here because I heard you in your sleep. Daddy always wants to be here to protect you. Come here.”\nI climb into your lap as you settle yourself against my pillows, sitting on my bed. Immediately comforted by your strong arms around me, I stop crying and stick my thumb in my mouth. You grab my hand and pull it out of my mouth; “darling, you know I don’t like you sucking your thumb. It’s bad for your teeth, puddin”\n“I know, daddy.” I rest my head against your chest \" it just feels good to suck my thumb, I don’t know why.\"\nYou look down at me, and trace my lips with your fingertips. “Does it feel good to suck daddy’s fingers?”\nYou ask as you slide one between my teeth. I start to suck on it, gently, you can feel my hot little tongue working as its pressed against it. You kiss my forehead and then my nose; then you pull your finger from my mouth and put it in yours. “Hmmm, baby, I don’t think my fingers taste as good as your thumb does.\nLet me try it.” You take my tiny thumb into your mouth and suck on it for a bit while I giggle. “Now put it back in your mouth and see if it still tastes as good.”\n“Daddy, it tastes warm now. Your mouth is warm” I say, smiling at you. You lean down and brush my lips with yours. Then, you kiss me fully. Your tongue fills my small mouth, you’re tasting me. I let out a tiny moan and you pull away “what’s wrong, baby?” I look down and keep silent. “Sweetie, don’t deny your papa. Give me kisses.” You reach your hand under my chin and tilt my face up to you and start kissing me again. My hands find their way to your face, then I wrap my arms around your neck. My entire body is pressed against yours, you feel me get warmer. Your heart is wildly beating as you slide your hand along my leg. There is no resistance from me when you reach my panties and slip your hand inside to cup my plump little ass.\nI keep kissing you, sucking on your tongue and lips, every once in a while moaning in pleasure. You match my moan with a squeeze on my ass, and I start moving, squirming, reacting to your touch.\nSlowly, carefully, you reach your hand around to explore my crotch. When you discover the moist lips and the tight little hole you stop kissing me “baby, has anyone ever touched you down here?” You wiggle your finger against my skin.\n“No, daddy.”\n“You know this part of you is just for me, right?”\n“Okay daddy, I understand. I won’t let anyone else touch it.”\n“Good girl. Daddies have special places just for their babies, too, did you know that?”\nI pull away, an excited grin on my face. “Show me, daddy! Show me what you have for me.”\nGently, you move me off your lap. Your hand still fondling my pussy, you use your other one to bring your cock out. My eyes grow wide with surprise as I see it. “What is that, daddy?”\n“It’s called a cock, baby girl. This is what I have to give you. It will be all yours, whenever you want it.”\n“What can it do?” I ask, dubiously. I reach out my hand to stroke it.\n“Here, sweetpea. Daddy will show you.”\nYou guide my hand around you, showing me how to stroke and rub your cock.\n“Daddy, look! It’s getting fatter and bigger!”\n“Haha yes, munchkin, that’s what cocks do when you play with them. Now try giving it kisses.”\nI bend over and smooch it on the shaft and look up at you.\n“No, baby. Give it a real kiss, like the ones you were giving daddy.”\nI lean down again, and start kissing your cock, my tongue darting out to lick at it. I kiss the head and explore the little hole with my tongue, then without you asking me to I take it in my mouth. I start sucking your cock as you continue to play with my hot little cunt. “That’s it, baby. That makes daddy so happy, you don’t even know.” I get wetter for your hand, you slide your fingertip between my pussy lips and feel the resistance there.\n“Sweetheart. How much do you love your daddy?”\nI look up at you and let your cock hang in my mouth as I say “so much daddy. I love you the most of anyone.”\n“I’m going to put my cock in your special place, sweetie. It’s going to hurt at first, but its good for you.”\n“Like getting shots at the doctors, daddy?”\n“Yes, kind of like that. You just have to relax and it won’t hurt as much. You have to be quiet, though, so we don’t wake everybody up.”\nI nod, trepidant. “Okay daddy.”\n“That’s a good girl. I’m going to put my fingers in first, to get you ready, so lie down on your back.”\nI obey you, and you take in the sight of me. Reaching down, you slowly pull off my panties and spread my legs. My hairless pussy glistens with my juices, you bring your face close and run your tongue along my slit. I gasp and start to tremble as you begin licking me from my tight little asshole to my baby clit. Gently, you press your finger into my hole, it’s very tight. “Uuuuuuunnnnhhhhhh, daddy, that hurts.” I say.\n“Yes baby girl. Get ready to take my cock in there.”\n“No, daddy, it’s too big, I can’t—!” You cover my mouth with your hand and tell me “remember sweetie, I’m doing this for you. It’s good for you and soon you will learn to like it. Now try to relax.”\nYou bring the swollen head of your cock against my nether lips, rubbing up and down in my sweet juices. Then you start to push it inside me and I go wild - clawing and struggling. My eyes are wide in pain and fear, I’m being stretched as you push past my cherry and all the way into me.\n“Mmmmmmpphhhhhhhhhhhh!!!” I scratch at your hand trying to get it off my mouth.\n“Shhhh. Baby, sweetheart, darling. Hush now little princess, the worst part is over.” You remove your hand and I burst into tears. You start to thrust inside my tight cunt as I’m crying, sobbing as my whole body is moved by each pound. You hold my arms tightly by my sides and continue to soothe me as you fuck me.\n“Ohhhh baby that’s so good, you’re such a brave girl. That’s right sweety, stop your crying, is it starting to feel good for you?”\n“It is, daddy. It feels good now. You’re so big inside me.” I say as my crying subsides. I’m now enjoying it, and you let go of my arms.\n“Put your fingers in my mouth, darling one.”\n“Okay daddy” I reach my hand up and you suck on my fingers as you continue to fuck me. I start to gyrate, my hips rising to meet yours with each thrust. I’m moaning now, and you lift my nightie up to see my chest, my cute baby nipples are stiff.\n“Suck on your fingers, ducky. You’re such a good girl for daddy. Do you want to see the best thing that daddys cock can do for you, sweetie?”\nI nod, my fingers in my mouth, moaning and pushing my little pelvis up to yours. You reach down and start to rub my clit, my pussy contracting on your cock as you drive it into me. “Do you love me baby?”\n“Yes, daddy, I-I loveeeee you!! Uuuunnnhhhhhh!!!” I scream as you bring me to climax. You blow your load deep in my tight hot body, you feel my pussy clamping down on your dick and you cum more and more inside me.\n“Daddy, it’s so hot in me. There’s so much!”\nYou pull your cock out of me, cum dripping from the end. My pussy squelches as it releases you, cum starts pouring out. “Wanna taste it, sweetie?”\nI lay there and you bring your cock to my mouth. I slowly, languidly suck you, swallowing our combined cum, my eyes heavy and drowsy. You watch me as I fall asleep with you in my mouth. Slowly, quietly, you pull out and lie down beside me, holding me in your arms. I nestle against you in my slumber, a small satisfied smile on my lips. “I love you, baby. I love you so much.”\n",

<p>I obey you, and you take in the sight of me. Reaching down, you slowly pull off my panties and spread my legs. My hairless pussy glistens with my juices, you bring your face close and run your tongue along my slit. I gasp and start to tremble as you begin licking me from my tight little asshole to my baby clit. Gently, you press your finger into my hole, it&rsquo;s very tight. &ldquo;Uuuuuuunnnnhhhhhh, daddy, that hurts.&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes baby girl. Get ready to take my cock in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, daddy, it&rsquo;s too big, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;!&rdquo; You cover my mouth with your hand and tell me &ldquo;remember sweetie, I&rsquo;m doing this for you. It&rsquo;s good for you and soon you will learn to like it. Now try to relax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You bring the swollen head of your cock against my nether lips, rubbing up and down in my sweet juices. Then you start to push it inside me and I go wild - clawing and struggling. My eyes are wide in pain and fear, I&rsquo;m being stretched as you push past my cherry and all the way into me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmmmmmpphhhhhhhhhhhh!!!&rdquo; I scratch at your hand trying to get it off my mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shhhh. Baby, sweetheart, darling. Hush now little princess, the worst part is over.&rdquo; You remove your hand and I burst into tears. You start to thrust inside my tight cunt as I&rsquo;m crying, sobbing as my whole body is moved by each pound. You hold my arms tightly by my sides and continue to soothe me as you fuck me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohhhh baby that&rsquo;s so good, you&rsquo;re such a brave girl. That&rsquo;s right sweety, stop your crying, is it starting to feel good for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, daddy. It feels good now. You&rsquo;re so big inside me.&rdquo; I say as my crying subsides. I&rsquo;m now enjoying it, and you let go of my arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your fingers in my mouth, darling one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay daddy&rdquo; I reach my hand up and you suck on my fingers as you continue to fuck me. I start to gyrate, my hips rising to meet yours with each thrust. I&rsquo;m moaning now, and you lift my nightie up to see my chest, my cute baby nipples are stiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suck on your fingers, ducky. You&rsquo;re such a good girl for daddy. Do you want to see the best thing that daddys cock can do for you, sweetie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nod, my fingers in my mouth, moaning and pushing my little pelvis up to yours. You reach down and start to rub my clit, my pussy contracting on your cock as you drive it into me. &ldquo;Do you love me baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, daddy, I-I loveeeee you!! Uuuunnnhhhhhh!!!&rdquo; I scream as you bring me to climax. You blow your load deep in my tight hot body, you feel my pussy clamping down on your dick and you cum more and more inside me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy, it&rsquo;s so hot in me. There&rsquo;s so much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You pull your cock out of me, cum dripping from the end. My pussy squelches as it releases you, cum starts pouring out. &ldquo;Wanna taste it, sweetie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lay there and you bring your cock to my mouth. I slowly, languidly suck you, swallowing our combined cum, my eyes heavy and drowsy. You watch me as I fall asleep with you in my mouth. Slowly, quietly, you pull out and lie down beside me, holding me in your arms. I nestle against you in my slumber, a small satisfied smile on my lips. &ldquo;I love you, baby. I love you so much.&rdquo;</p>
