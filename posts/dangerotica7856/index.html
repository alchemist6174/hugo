  "articleBody": "It was the usual message on my phone on a Friday afternoon ‘will you babysit Kerry tonight? I’ll give you the usual rate’ and as I usually spent my weekends studying, it only made it easier for me without my dad having his pervy friends round, plus it was extra money which I needed as a 19 year old student.\nSo, as I arrived at Karen’s house, I never had to knock, I’d just walk in. Kerry would be in her travel cot and Karen upstairs getting ready. I’d hear her thumping downstairs ‘see you in the morning’ and the door would slam.\n2 year old Kerry was very under developed, she could only say basic words so she’d just sit in her dirty travel cot while I studied. I took her to bed around 7pm and she’d sleep right through. I settled her down in bed and went back down to continue my studying. At around 9pm, I heard a thud, it was Kerry, she’d fell out of bed. She needed a nappy change.\nAs I sat on her bed and layed her down next to me, I removed her nappy and leant over her to pick the wipes up, she’d only had a wee. As my eyes examined the little pink, under developed sex, I felt an urge to caress and touch her. Who’d find out? I was alone and hadn’t masturbated in a few days.\nMy hand moved slowly towards her young lips, and I slowly parted them with my thumb and forefinger, to reveal the soft, shiny pink flesh. I leaned in to get a closer look, it was still slightly wet from her nappy, I licked my finger and slowly caressed her tiny clitoris, starting at the top and working my way down. Kerry squirmed as I started to tap on her tender clit with my arm holding her little legs open, it seemed to be a pleasurable squirm, so I carried on. I spat on my finger and rubbed it onto her clit and watched as it dripped onto her tiny hole, and her anus.\nAt this point, my knickers were soaking wet. I decided to get naked and lay down next to her, my head level with her tiny sex. I rubbed her small anus a little and then wet my fingers more as I touched the infants wet flesh, keeping her exposed with my fingers, with my other hand, I slowly started to masturbate myself, touching myself gently, I don’t think I’d ever been this wet before!\nI moved my head in to get a closer look, all the while touching my swollen clit. I tapped her tiny clit with my tongue and started circling around it, Kerry just laying there, completely relaxed but with a slight struggle to sit up. I licked from top to bottom and partially slipped the end of my tongue in her tiny opening, it got more vigorous as I moved my tongue in and out of her, I could feel my tainted becoming more intense, so I turned round and placed my vagina just above her mouth.\nI was soaking and it was dripping into her mouth, even though I hadn’t yet reached my climax. I slowly lowered my swollen sex and gently rested my swollen clit on her mouth. She opened her mouth slightly and started to gently suckle like she did on her bottle. I carried on spitting and caressing her with my tongue and slipped the end into her anus then back to her clit. The suckling on my swollen, exposed clit became too intense, I couldn’t stop myself from reaching the most intense climax I had ever had in my whole life. My clit was throbbing and pulsing away in her gentle soft mouth and my vagina clenching together rhythmically and dripping on her nose. It took me a while to catch my breath as I reached the end of my climax, making a riding motion on her face, being careful not to smother. I was drained.\nI cleaned up and got Kerry settled back in bed, went downstairs and fell asleep almost instantly on the couch. Friday nights were never the same again…\n",
