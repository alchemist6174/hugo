She was a pure killer. Deadly.\n“Meow,” the kitty-cat said again.\nMyau was in a tight spot; a troll had her cornered and he’d already smacked her twice in the head with his gigantic club. Now he grabbed her by her hair and started dragging her to his lair. This was bad news.\nThe kitty-cat sat back on her hind legs, watching.\n“Shit!” I said. The troll tossed her against the cave wall and I managed to get her back on her feet but he’d already dropped his pants, a gigantic swollen member between his legs.\n“Hey, maybe you shouldn’t watch,” I said to the kitty-cat. “This is an adult game.”\nThe kitty-cat looked at me and then back at the TV.\nIt was a good thing for Myau that the troll wanted to rape her. It’s easier to distract the fuckers if they have their minds on sex. I let go of the controls completely, Myau just standing there mutely, and the troll made his move, ready to take his prize. If he gets that gigantic member inside her, she’s toast, a bloody mess and game over. At the last possible second I unleashed Myau’s best move, a wicked hard kick, right to the troll’s enormous but sadly vulnerable nuts.\n“Yay!” the kitty-cat said.\nThe troll staggered back two steps, then fell backwards. Myau jumped forward, grabbed his cudgel, and beat his head into a pancake.\n“Yay!” the kitty-cat said again, wapping her front paws together.\nThe good thing about killing a troll in his lair is that they always have lots of plunder, and this guy was no exception. But there was a surprise, too: A prisoner; a morph. This was a jaguar-human morph. Could be dangerous, but Myau really needed to recharge her batteries and this was a lucky break. Besides, he’ll catch a good price at the slave market.\nMyau opened the cage door and the jaguar-man jumped at her, but she just laughed, he was chained to back of the cage and his lunging just made his collar pull hard on his neck.\n“Don’t watch,” I said to the kitty-cat, “Myau needs to get energy now.”\nThe kitty-cat looked at me and then back at the TV.\nMyau sank down onto her hands and knees, her tail straight up in the air; she turned her backside towards the jaguar-man and dropped down on her elbows. Jaguar-man’s member instantly grew to a large (though not troll-like) size, and he pounced.\nThe kitty-cat was sitting on her back legs, her front paws held up to her chest, watching the screen in fascination.\nLuckily, Jaguar-man got it over with quick. You never know what sort of shit is going to show up while you’re “replenishing your energy.” He gave it only about a dozen solid thrusts, and then he howled, then pulled out, his member rapidly deflating. Myau’s energy was back at 100%. Sweet!\nMyau broke Jaguar-man’s chain off the cage and led him out of the cave and I hit the pause button.\n“Meow!” the kitty-cat said.\n“Did you enjoy that?”\n“Meow!” the kitty-cat said again, nodding her head.\n“Sorry it was so, you know, dirty.”\n“Meow,” kitty-cat said, shrugging her shoulders.\n“You don’t mind, do you?” I said, scratching her head.\n“Meow,” kitty-cat said, shaking her head and then rubbing her cheek against my leg.\n“So, what do you want to do today? It’s still a couple hours before your mom gets home. You wanna go to the park?”\nThe kitty-cat shook her head.\n“Bike ride?”\nThe kitty-cat shook her head.\n“What do you want to do then?”\nThe kitty-cat lifted a front paw in the air and swiped her claws at me. “Rwraaw,” she said.\n“Oh, you want to fight?”\nThe kitty-cat got down on her hands and knees and crawled backward, then lifted a paw and swiped it at me again. “Rwraaw!”\nI climbed off the couch onto the floor, onto my hands and knees. I lifted a paw and swiped it at her. “I’m a tomcat,” I said.\n“Rwoew!” she said, swiping a paw at me.\nI swiped back, gently hitting her on the head and almost knocking her kitty-cat ears off. With that, she pounced on me and we were entangled, wrestling.\nI let her win, like I always do, and she was on top of me, holding my arms down and sitting on my stomach. “Rwahhaw!” she growled, her face right in front of mine.\nI lifted my face up to hers, our noses were an inch apart now. “Rweow,” I said, snarling.\n“Rweow,” she said back, snarling.\nI stuck my tongue out, she stuck her tongue out, our tongues touched. She sat back, surprised. She let go of my arms and I took advantage, grabbing her wrists and flipping her over onto her back. Now I was on top of her, her legs around my waist, her arms up over her head.\n“Rweow!” I snarled, right in her face.\n“Rweow!” she snarled back. She stuck her tongue out, I stuck my tongue out, our tongues touched. She pulled her tongue back, into her mouth, but my tongue followed it in. It wasn’t really a kiss, it was just my tongue in her mouth.\nI pulled my tongue out, shocked; I hadn’t intended to french the girl. She was looking up at me, her eyes twinkling, her mouth open. I really couldn’t help it, I just leaned back down and put my tongue back in.\nWe lay there, me and the little kitty-cat, kissing. I filled her mouth with my tongue, exploring, touching everything. She kept her mouth open wide, letting me into her, letting me explore.\nAs we kissed, my body almost instinctively started moving, “dry humping” her, pushing my now-hard penis against her sex. She opened her legs wide to allow me access.\nIt took a couple of minutes for my brain to catch up to my penis, but eventually it did, and I pulled my tongue out of the girl’s mouth and sat up. Her face was crimson.\n“Cindy, I’m sorry, I…”\n“Meow?”\n“I shouldn’t have…”\n“Meow!” She sat up, then turned over onto her hands and knees, her bottom facing me. She dropped down on her elbows and looked back at me. “Meow?”\n“Are you Myau?” I asked.\n“Meow.” She nodded.\nI took my position behind her, playing the Jaguar-man. I started “dry humping” her again, pushing my still-hard penis against her sex. Only a dozen thrusts and I felt an overwhelming need to come. I was almost at orgasm already.\nMy penis was thinking for me again, my brain left far behind now. I unzipped my pants and fished my dick out. I held my hand up against her pubis, underneath her, my fingers wrapped in an open fist, and I began fucking my hand as if it were her pussy, her sweet little nine year old kitty-cat pussy. She lifted herself up enough that she could watch, the top of her head on the floor holding her weight and her face looking through her arms, underneath her, watching as my penis pumped in and out of my hand. She reached a hand up and felt my head, touching it gently each time it poked through my curled fingers.\n“Oh, Cindy! Oh, Cindy!” I shouted as I began to orgasm, a huge thick stream of come firing out of me, splattering against her hand and then hitting the carpet, splashing up onto her face. I continued fucking my hand, fucking her, fucking my little nine year old kitty cat, as I fired shot after shot onto her hand and the floor and her face.\nThe doorbell rang the next afternoon. All I could see through the peep-hole was a pair of kitty-cat ears. I opened the door.\n“Meow?” the little kitty-cat said.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>&ldquo;Meow,&rdquo; the little kitty-cat said.</p>
<p>I looked down at her. &ldquo;What a cute little kitty-cat!&rdquo; I reached down and scratched her head between her little kitty-cat ears.</p>
<p>She purred, lifted her head to be scratched some more, then rubbed her cheek against my leg.</p>
<p>I went back to the video game; I was playing my favorite avatar, a nine year old cat-girl morph named Myau. She was a pure killer. Deadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meow,&rdquo; the kitty-cat said again.</p>
<p>Myau was in a tight spot; a troll had her cornered and he&rsquo;d already smacked her twice in the head with his gigantic club. Now he grabbed her by her hair and started dragging her to his lair. This was bad news.</p>
<p>The kitty-cat sat back on her hind legs, watching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; I said. The troll tossed her against the cave wall and I managed to get her back on her feet but he&rsquo;d already dropped his pants, a gigantic swollen member between his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t watch,&rdquo; I said to the kitty-cat. &ldquo;This is an adult game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kitty-cat looked at me and then back at the TV.</p>
<p>It was a good thing for Myau that the troll wanted to rape her. It&rsquo;s easier to distract the fuckers if they have their minds on sex. I let go of the controls completely, Myau just standing there mutely, and the troll made his move, ready to take his prize. If he gets that gigantic member inside her, she&rsquo;s toast, a bloody mess and game over. At the last possible second I unleashed Myau&rsquo;s best move, a wicked hard kick, right to the troll&rsquo;s enormous but sadly vulnerable nuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; the kitty-cat said.</p>
<p>The troll staggered back two steps, then fell backwards. Myau jumped forward, grabbed his cudgel, and beat his head into a pancake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; the kitty-cat said again, wapping her front paws together.</p>
<p>The good thing about killing a troll in his lair is that they always have lots of plunder, and this guy was no exception. But there was a surprise, too: A prisoner; a morph. This was a jaguar-human morph. Could be dangerous, but Myau really needed to recharge her batteries and this was a lucky break. Besides, he&rsquo;ll catch a good price at the slave market.</p>
<p>Myau opened the cage door and the jaguar-man jumped at her, but she just laughed, he was chained to back of the cage and his lunging just made his collar pull hard on his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t watch,&rdquo; I said to the kitty-cat, &ldquo;Myau needs to get energy now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kitty-cat looked at me and then back at the TV.</p>

Myau&rsquo;s energy was back at 100%. Sweet!</p>
<p>Myau broke Jaguar-man&rsquo;s chain off the cage and led him out of the cave and I hit the pause button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meow!&rdquo; the kitty-cat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you enjoy that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meow!&rdquo; the kitty-cat said again, nodding her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry it was so, you know, dirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meow,&rdquo; kitty-cat said, shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind, do you?&rdquo; I said, scratching her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meow,&rdquo; kitty-cat said, shaking her head and then rubbing her cheek against my leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, what do you want to do today? It&rsquo;s still a couple hours before your mom gets home. You wanna go to the park?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kitty-cat shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bike ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kitty-cat shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kitty-cat lifted a front paw in the air and swiped her claws at me. &ldquo;Rwraaw,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you want to fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kitty-cat got down on her hands and knees and crawled backward, then lifted a paw and swiped it at me again. &ldquo;Rwraaw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I climbed off the couch onto the floor, onto my hands and knees. I lifted a paw and swiped it at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a tomcat,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>I let her win, like I always do, and she was on top of me, holding my arms down and sitting on my stomach. &ldquo;Rwahhaw!&rdquo; she growled, her face right in front of mine.</p>
<p>I lifted my face up to hers, our noses were an inch apart now. &ldquo;Rweow,&rdquo; I said, snarling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rweow,&rdquo; she said back, snarling.</p>
<p>I stuck my tongue out, she stuck her tongue out, our tongues touched. She sat back, surprised. She let go of my arms and I took advantage, grabbing her wrists and flipping her over onto her back. Now I was on top of her, her legs around my waist, her arms up over her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rweow!&rdquo; I snarled, right in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rweow!&rdquo; she snarled back. She stuck her tongue out, I stuck my tongue out, our tongues touched. She pulled her tongue back, into her mouth, but my tongue followed it in. It wasn&rsquo;t really a kiss, it was just my tongue in her mouth.</p>
<p>I pulled my tongue out, shocked; I hadn&rsquo;t intended to french the girl. She was looking up at me, her eyes twinkling, her mouth open. I really couldn&rsquo;t help it, I just leaned back down and put my tongue back in.</p>
<p>We lay there, me and the little kitty-cat, kissing. I filled her mouth with my tongue, exploring, touching everything. She kept her mouth open wide, letting me into her, letting me explore.</p>
<p>As we kissed, my body almost instinctively started moving, &ldquo;dry humping&rdquo; her, pushing my now-hard penis against her sex. She opened her legs wide to allow me access.</p>
<p>It took a couple of minutes for my brain to catch up to my penis, but eventually it did, and I pulled my tongue out of the girl&rsquo;s mouth and sat up. Her face was crimson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cindy, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meow!&rdquo; She sat up, then turned over onto her hands and knees, her bottom facing me. She dropped down on her elbows and looked back at me. &ldquo;Meow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Myau?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meow.&rdquo; She nodded.</p>
<p>I took my position behind her, playing the Jaguar-man. I started &ldquo;dry humping&rdquo; her again, pushing my still-hard penis against her sex. Only a dozen thrusts and I felt an overwhelming need to come. I was almost at orgasm already.</p>
<p>My penis was thinking for me again, my brain left far behind now. I unzipped my pants and fished my dick out. I held my hand up against her pubis, underneath her, my fingers wrapped in an open fist, and I began fucking my hand as if it were her pussy, her sweet little nine year old kitty-cat pussy. She lifted herself up enough that she could watch, the top of her head on the floor holding her weight and her face looking through her arms, underneath her, watching as my penis pumped in and out of my hand. She reached a hand up and felt my head, touching it gently each time it poked through my curled fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cindy! Oh, Cindy!&rdquo; I shouted as I began to orgasm, a huge thick stream of come firing out of me, splattering against her hand and then hitting the carpet, splashing up onto her face. I continued fucking my hand, fucking her, fucking my little nine year old kitty cat, as I fired shot after shot onto her hand and the floor and her face.</p>
<hr>
<p>The doorbell rang the next afternoon. All I could see through the peep-hole was a pair of kitty-cat ears. I opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meow?&rdquo; the little kitty-cat said.</p>
