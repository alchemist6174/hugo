  "articleBody": "–3:06\nEINSTEIN: Hey, kids! What time is it? (sounder: “It’s Einstein time!”) That’s right! And today, Mikey D is promising a historic announcement.\nMIKE DANIELS aka MIKEY D: Welll, do you remember, it was at this time a month ago that I told you and the crew that I was working on something really special.\nEINSTEIN: I do.\nMIKEY D: Well, thank God, that project is finished. And I will tell you before the show ends today just exactly what that project entailed. In the meantime, you remember about a month ago, a girl named Cooper called in. She said she and her basketball team wanted to pose nude for their annual program.\nEINSTEIN: I remember that.\nMIKEY D: Well, I’ve been pushing them back because of my project. But they will be here next Friday in the studio\nEINSTEIN: Did they say how many were coming?\nMIKEY D: She got the whole team. Three coaches and a trainer included.\nEINSTEIN: Wow! That’s going to be a full show just with them!\nDYLAN: So what you’re saying is we’re going to have a studio full of girls next Friday?\nMIKEY D: It’ll be like you died and went to heaven. Thirteen girls between twelve and fourteen, plus the four adults.\nJAY HART: Damn, I’m getting a hard on just thinking about it!\nEINSTEIN: Pfffft! You’re always getting hard because your brain is screwed up, Jay.\nJAY: Yeah, that’s probably true.\nEINSTEIN: Anyway, ooh! We have a great show today.\nVICKI: Isn’t every day a great show?\nEINSTEIN: No. But some are sexier than others. This looks like another great show to me. The first hour’s kind of open. It’ll give you a chance to call in and talk to us about anything. And we’ll also have some “Show and Tell”. At least the tell part. I’ll have to describe the show. And if you want to see what the hell I’m talking about, head over einsteinshow.net and click on “Show and Tell”. We’ve got a couple hundred girls, I think, Mikey D.\nMIKEY D: We got about two to three hundred. That’s pretty fair for a first month.\nEINSTEIN: And we’ll see how many we can get to before our studio guests get here. In the second hour, we have an interesting story. A Florida elementary school put on a play involving the kids, of course. The play was called Kidsville, USA, and involved the students stripping, fucking, using dirty language….\nDYLAN: You mean like we use here eveyday?\nEINSTEIN: Yeah. And using the toliet.\nDYLAN: On stage?\nEINSTEIN: Yeah.\nDYLAN: Wow! Holy shit!\nEINSTEIN: The play was performed three times. And there was plenty of outrage after each show. I guess because when the name is Kidsville, USA, you don’t think of sex, nudity, language, and pee.\nDYLAN: True!\nEINSTEIN: We have the writer of the play, plus some of the actors from the show here in the studio.\nDYLAN: Awesome! Maybe we can fuck with them.\nEINSTEIN: Maybe. But maybe you want to save yourself for the third hour.\nJAY: Really. What’s up?\nCHRIS COOPER: Hope it’s really good.\nEINSTEIN: In the third hour, our friends from Texas will be here.\nJAY: Yes!\nEINSTEIN: Our favorite southern girls, the Texas Belles as we like to call them, Donna, Kristine, and Anne Marie will be in the studio. And let me tell you if you’ve never met them before. They like to get down, and get dirty,……and get naked. If you don’t have Einstein 24/7 yet, this would be a great day to get it. Just $49.95 for one year or $6.95 a month….\nMIKEY D: Actually, Einstein, there’s going to be a price increase on Einstein 24/7 on Monday.\nEINSTEIN: Whoa! Is that a part of the big announcement?\nMIKEY D: Yes, and of course I’ll explain later. But if you want Einstein 24/7 before the price goes up, and you’ll understand why, head to the website now….\nEINSTEIN: einsteinshow.net….\nMIKEY D: Because Monday morning, it’s going up. And can I make a recommendation to the listeners?\nEINSTEIN: Yeah.\nMIKEY: The year long is a lot better.\nEINSTEIN: I agree. So, like I said another great show! Let’s kick it off with some Robin Thicke and “Blurred Lines” on “The Einstein Show”.\n(“Blurred Lines” plays)\nEINSTEIN: Robin Thicke on “The Einstein Show”. Almost as talented as his dad.\nVICKI HUBERT: What? What do you mean almost?\nEINSTEIN: Well, his dad is a musician, sometimes a singer, and an actor, and a game show host, and had a late night talk how.\nVICKI: Who’s his daddy?\nEINSTEIN: Alan Thicke.\nVICKI: Alan Thicke…you mean the guy from Growing Pains?\nEINSTEIN: Yeah.\nVICKI: Oh, c’mon, Robin’s got so much soul.\nEINSTEIN: That’s true. But you remember Diff’rent Strokes and The Facts Of Life.\nVICKI: Yeah.\nEINSTEIN: Well, Alan wrote the theme music.\nVICKI: Oh, he did?\nEINSTEIN: Yeah, and then if you go on to You Tube, and find really old, like 1970s episodes of Wheel of Fortune…..\nVICKI: Wait, that show’s been around since the seventies? Supposedly they’re celebrating thirty years, which means it started in 1983. You know…when you were little.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, no. Way before that. In fact, ever heard of a guy named Chuck Woolery?\nVICKI: Oh, he was the host on Looooooooove Connection.\nEINSTEIN: Yep. He was the original host.\nVICKI: Really?\nEINSTEIN: Yep! Anyway, Alan wrote the theme music for that, too.\nVICKI: Well, you sure know how to surprise me,\nEINSTEIN: Anyway, so like I said, the first hour is kind of open today. We always invite you to call in at 1-855-EINSTEIN. That’s 1-855-346-7834. Maybe you got vacation plans and have a question. Maybe you have a fantasy you want to share. Whatever it is, let us hear from you at 1-855-EINSTEIN…1-855-346-7834. And also during this hour, we’ll have some “Show and Tell” from the einsteinshow.net website. I’ll tell you about some of the pictures that have been sent in. You can go see them for yourself and comment. Also, girls, you can send in your photos, whether topless, bottomless, or naked to einsteinshow.net and click on “Show and Tell”. Then click on the submission form. Oh, parents, it’s okay to tell. But, only girls under eighteen can show. Boy, I just barely got the phone number out, and there’s already a caller. Carly in Michigan, you’re on “The Einstein Show”.\nCARLY: Hi, Einstein!\nEINSTEIN: Well, hi, Carly!\nCARLY: Do you ‘memba when I called you last time?\nEINSTEIN: Help me out, babe.\nCARLY: When you had Tiffany on?\nEINSTEIN: Oh, that’s right! Tiffany Roman was here. And you called in.\nCARLY: Uh-huh, ‘cuz I want to be like her.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, now I remember! I asked you how old you were. You said eight.\nCARLY: Uh-huh.\nEINSTEIN: I thought it was kind of funny, because you listen to Carly and she sounds so sweet. Then she says ‘I wanna be in porn’.\nCARLY: Yep!\nEINSTEIN: Anyway, that was a month ago. Her mom, Amy, got you an audition there in Michigan.\nCARLY: Uh-huh.\nEINSTEIN: And what happened?\nCARLY: Well, mom took me to the studio. She watched.\nEINSTEIN: She watched knowing you were going to be totally, you know, violated.\nCARLY: Yep!\nEINSTEIN: And then what?\nCARLY: Well, he asked questions. Then the man said to take clothes off. So I did. Then he took clothes off and said to suck his thing.\nEINSTEIN: His penis.\nCARLY: Uh-huh, I suck his penis. Then he put penis in me. And he pushed it hard.\nEINSTEIN: Wow! This is starting to sound like an adult porn audition, not a kid’s. Anyway……\nCARLY: Well, it hurt for little bit, then go away.\nEINSTEIN: Did you like his penis inside you?\nCARLY: Uh-huh! Then when done, the lady took clothes off.\nEINSTEIN: Well, this is getting a little interesting! What did she say?\nCARLY: She want me to suck titties.\nEINSTEIN: I see! Could you tell how big her tits were?\nCARLY: They look big to me.\nEINSTEIN: Yeah, I guess you can’t tell very well. Anyway, so you’re sucking on her titties……\nCARLY: And licking on her nippies.\nEINSTEIN: Nipples, I think. I would suck and lick a woman’s nipples.\nCARLY: Then she want me to stick tongue in her belly button.\nEINSTEIN: Really? Haven’t heard that happen too much. But they must have fans who like it. Did you get to suck her pussy?\nCARLY: Uh-huh.\nEINSTEIN: How was it?\nCARLY: Very sweet.\nEINSTEIN: Really? That’s awesome!\nCARLY: Then she lay me on couch and feel me, and suck nippies, and lick my belly button.\nEINSTEIN: Did she go down on you?\nCARLY: Yeah!\nEINSTEIN: Did you orgasm?\nCARLY: Uh-huh. I ‘memba screaming.\nEINSTEIN: Sounds like it. Seems like you did really well.\nCARLY: Uh-huh. Did two films so far.\nEINSTEIN: Oh wow! Have either of them come out yet?\nCARLY: Not yet. Working on it.\nEINSTEIN: Do you enjoy being a porn actress?\nCARLY: Yeah! I like naked.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, you really like the naked part.\nCARLY: Yeah.\nEINSTEIN: Well, Carly, I’m glad we were able to help you in your dream to be a porn star. We’d love to have you in the studio when your films come out.\nCARLY: Love to come see Einstein!\nEINSTEIN: Well, you have a great evening, darlin’! Thanks for calling!\nCARLY: Bye, Einstein!\nEINSTEIN: Bye, babe. Oh, man! Did you try to picture that? So vivid to me.\nDYLAN: I’d love to go down on her.\nEINSTEIN: Just like you did at that party?\nDYLAN: Yeah. Lick her cunt.\nEINSTEIN: I’d think about everyone in the studio, with the exception of Vicki, would want to have their way with Carly.\nVICKI: Yeah, you know them little white girls don’t interest me a bit. Bring me a brother with a real piece of meat.\nEINSTEIN: Of course! I knew that! Probably some teen black boys.\nVICKI: That’s the best kind.\nEINSTEIN: I swear Vicki’s not usually like this. I better take another call. Jim in New York, you’re on “The Einstein Show”.\nJIM: Hi, Einstein!\nEINSTEIN: Hi, Jim! You must be one of our older listeners.\nJIM: Yeah, I am.\nEINSTEIN: Oh well! Old…young…we don’t care. So, what’s up?\nJIM: Well, you know the Supreme Court came out and said it was okay for gays to marry.\nEINSTEIN: Right.\nJIM: Well, do you think that will eventually include those of us who love kids?\nEINSTEIN: That’s a great question. I know it’s political. But it’s a great question. I would think that the answer is yes.\nJIM: I hope so, too, so I can marry my little lover.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, who’s the lucky girl?\nJIM: Her name is Sami. She’s right here.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, really? Put her on. (Jim hands the phone to Sami.)\nSAMI: Hi, Einstein!\nEINSTEIN: Hi, Sami! How are you?\nSAMI: I’m doing fine now that I’m with my big man.\nEINSTEIN: I see! And how old are you?\nSAMI: I’m twelve.\nEINSTEIN: Twelve sounds so perfect. So innocent looking, yet developed enough to cause problems.\nSAMI: Yep! That’s me!\nEINSTEIN: So how do you know Jim?\nSAMI: He’s my best friend’s dad.\nEINSTEIN: Ah! I see! And who’s your best friend?\nSAMI: Victoria.\nEINSTEIN: And does Victoria know that you and her dad are, you know….\nSAMI: Yeah. In fact, she encouraged it.\nEINSTEIN: Really?\nSAMI: Yeah, her dad loved when I came over to visit her. And so he asks me to come over on Fridays for some fun.\nEINSTEIN: So, do your parents know you fuck with your friend’s dad?\nSAMI: No. They assume I’m with Victoria.\nEINSTEIN: Aha!\nSAMI: Hey, Einstein, I’m not wearing anything.\nEINSTEIN: You’re butt naked?\nSAMI: Yeah, and Jim’s naked, too.\nEINSTEIN: Sounds like you two are getting it on. I’d better let you two go, so you can have some fun. Say hi to Jim and Victoria for me.\nSAMI: I will, Einstein.\nEINSTEIN: Bye, Sami! Boy, that is one lucky son of a bitch! The guy is like late thirties or early forties, and he’s nailing a twelve-year-old girl.\nDYLAN: Well, you know I’d nail a twelve-year-old girl if I could get away with it.\nEINSTEIN: Coming up after the bottom of the hour news, it’s “Show and Tell” time. Plus more of your calls as “The Einstein Show” continues.\n–3:20–\nEINSTEIN: Back with more of “The Einstein Show”. We’re taking some calls this hour and having “Show and Tell”. Next hour, the writer of Kidsville, USA along with some of the kids from the Florida production of the show will be here. Then in the third hour, our Texas Belles, Donna, Kristine, and Anne Marie will be here.\nCHRIS: Will they be naked in the studio?\nEINSTEIN: I’m pretty sure they will be. They don’t mind being naked in public at all. Call it free entertainment for you guys. Ben in New Jersey, you’re on “The Einstein Show”.\nBEN: Hi, everyone!\nDYLAN: Hi, Ben!\nBEN: I’m going to be in New York next week, and I was wondering if you could recommend some places to visit….you know beyond the typical tourist clap trap.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, the place I’d recommend after the Statue of Liberty, after the Empire State Building, after Rockefeller Center, and after Times Square would be The Clubhouse. They have some of the best dancers in the area. Even better than some of their adult counterparts.\nBEN: Nice.\nEINSTEIN: Most of the dancers will even let you come back and have some one-on-one VIP time with them. When we went there last month with Andrea, she went in very apprehensive. After watching the show and being able to spend quality time with Marley, she thoroughly enjoyed it.\nVICKI: I seem to recall Marley enjoyed it, too. Even so much as stripping Andrea.\nDYLAN: Oh, God! That was a great night. I got to fuck Marley, too. She was awesome for a young girl. How old is she?\nEINSTEIN: Thirteen, she said.\nCHRIS: Marley was wonderful. It’s amazing how we put all of our dicks in her, plus Dylan’s hand and she still survived the night okay.\nBEN: So, basically, you can go there and have sex with the dancers.\nEINSTEIN: Yes, and it’s absolutely encouraged.\nBEN: What kinds of dancers do they have.\nEINSTEIN: Practically every kind possible. White chicks, black chicks, latina chicks, Asian chicks. And I think the youngest one is seven. And they go right up to seventeen.\nBEN: Nice. I wonder if the seven-year-old can handle a big dick?\nEINSTEIN: Only one way to find out. Go and enjoy yourself.\nBEN: I will, Einstein! Thanks for the recommendation.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, no problem, Ben! Thanks for calling. I love going to The Clubhouse. Andrea and I even went last week and had a good time with Emily.\nDYLAN: Oh, how old is she?\nEINSTEIN: Ten. So, she had two little bumps. Andrea and I didn’t mind. We still had fun eating her pussy, and Emily enjoyed my dynamite.\nJAY: Damn!\nEINSTEIN: Lemme take one more call before the break. Chuck in Mississippi, you’re on “The Einstein Show”.\nCHUCK: Hi, Einstein!\nEINSTEIN: Hi, Chuck! What’s on your mind?\nCHUCK: Well, I was wondering if you all had any thoughts on a nude pageant.\nEINSTEIN: Huh? Actually, I hadn’t. I don’t know if anyone else had.\nMIKEY D: Actually, Einstein, that’s on my list of things to do.\nEINSTEIN: Now, there’s something up. We wouldn’t have thought about this because of the time invovled.\nMIKEY D: True.\nEINSTEIN: So, I take it that you’ve got a plan already.\nMIKEY D: And don’t worry, it’ll be one of the best things we’ve ever done.\nEINSTEIN: Alrighty! I’ll believe you. Is that good, Chuck!\nCHUCK: Very good, Einstein! I look forward to it.\nEINSTEIN: Thanks for calling, Chuck! I wonder what other surprises are in store for today. If you’re looking for the best kiddie porn videos for you and your entire family, look no further than my friends from A Video. We talk here a lot about how our schools are so cash-strapped that we have students wanting to pose nude for athletic programs. Well, our friends at A have a better idea. They went to several schools this year and said ‘Hey, have a Naked Friday! Here’s twenty five grand!’ They filmed school for an entire day and edited out the boring stuff. What does that leave? Plenty! Plenty of sex and lots of skin. And for the ladies out there, plenty of meat. Check out the latest videos from New York, Maine, Texas, Florida, Arizona, California, and Washington. Plus follow students from “The Program” in Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio, Michigan, and North Dakota. And check out “Naked Sports” from California, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. I dare you to watch all of them this weekend. That’s A Video at Loliwood Stores throughout America. Coming up, it’s time for “Show and Tell”. Back with more of “The Einstein Show” after this break.\n–3:34\nEINSTEIN: Back with more of “The Einstein Show”. Jay’s here. Chris is here. Dylan the Resident Lesbian is here. Vicki’s here, of course! And Mikey D, who I swear has so many secrets he’s not telling me.\nMIKEY D: In due time, Einstein. I promise.\nEINSTEIN: Okay. Well, since we had some time this morning, I thought we’d take a look at some of the pictures from “Show and Tell” on our website at einsteinshow.net. Now, if you want to look along with us, here’s how the URL works. It’s einsteinshow-dot-net-slash-showandtell-slash-thenumber. Whatever the number is goes after the last slash. I’ll tell you the number. Then the crew will give their opinions of the pictures there. If you would like to leave a comment under each submission, we certainly invite you to do so.\nDYLAN: I assume I get to join in, too.\nEINSTEIN: Of course! You love girls. Right?\nDYLAN: Absolutely.\nEINSTEIN: Then you may certainly tell me what you think. Up first is number 113 from seven-year-old Carmela from Mississippi. Her mother, Dora writes in:\nHi, Einstein! Hi, Dylan and the crew!\nI’ve been a listener for the last year and really enjoy all of the crazy antics. I heard you mention “Show an Tell” on the air a week or so ago. And I knew my daughter, Carmela, would be perfect. I ran the idea by her, of course. And needless to say, she couldn’t wait. You see the first picture with Spongebob on the television. Personally, I think my Carmela is a lot better than Spongebob.\nOh, I agree, Dora. Carmela is fucking cute to start with. Brown hair and brown eyes. And then to have the body she’s got standing in her underwear. Jesus, it blows my mind.\nOf course, it gets better once the panties are gone and Carmela poses stark naked.\nOh, my God! You aren’t kidding! I love the kitty!\nDYLAN: I so wanna lick that kitty!\nEINSTEIN: Well, it’s an awesome kitty. And it wouldn’t be the first time you’ve licked a seven-year-old anyway.\nDYLAN: I’ve become a pedo like you.\nEINSTEIN: I’d say so.\nJAY: I’ve been a pedo for years. This show has just let me live out the fantasy as reality.\nEINSTEIN: Yeah, especially after fucking all these Playdate candidates.\nJAY: True. And Carmela here….did you check out her little ass?\nEINSTEIN: You like the ass?\nJAY: Yeah, it’s a great ass!\nHave fun checking out her intimate parts. She was kind enough to let me do close-ups of everything. Thanks, Einstein. I hope everyone like Carmela. Signed, Dora S.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, my God! That is a nice ass.\nCHRIS: Sorry, I’m love with the kitty. Especially, this picture down here.\nEINSTEIN: Wow, a close-up inside Carmela’s little cunt.\nDYLAN: That’s definitely a lickable cunt. Though I like this one of her asshole.\nEINSTEIN: You’d rim it?\nDYLAN: Fuck yeah!\nEINSTEIN: Well, looking at the responses, I’d say Carmela is doing pretty well. I think the guys here want more. I know we want more.\nVICKI: Speak for yourself. I wanna a brother’s piece of meat.\nEINSTEIN: Next we’ll go to…….number 143….which is nine-year-old Stephani from Colorado. Her mom, Donna, wrote in…..\nHi, Einstein!\nRemember us? We called in when you had one of the Playdate models in the studio. I mentioned at the time that my nine and six year old wanted to pose for the magazine, and was worried they would try to talk the four-year-old into doing it, too. After the call, I talked with my girls about it, and they thought it would be a good idea to pose for you all. Besides they all love you and the show. So, first up is my nine-year-old daughter, Stephani.\nOh, my God! Have I ever mentioned I love redheads? Damn, Donna! If Stephani is like this, I wonder what the other girls are like?\nDYLAN: Damn, she’s fuckin’ dreamy, Einstein. Love her tummy.\nEINSTEIN: I love her tummy, too. But check out that fine ass there. Who’s this on the phone?\nDONNA: Hi, Einstein! It’s Donna!\nEINSTEIN: Holy shit! Donna, I hope you know what a knockout you have in Stephani!\nDONNA: Oh, I do indeed, Einstein! Thank you!\nEINSTEIN: I just mentioned I love her ass. But I love her tummy and her belly button. Oh, I can’t forget about the kitty. It’s perfect.\nDONNA: Oh, yes it is. Did you scroll down to where my husband put it in there?\nEINSTEIN: Holy shit! He had sex with Stephani?\nDONNA: Yes, and they loved it.\nEINSTEIN: (scrolls down the page and sees a penis inside Stephani’s vagina.) Wow! I can see it looks like she took it all in.\nDONNA: Yeah, and my husband does have a big dick.\nEINSTEIN: Oh my God! Sometimes I look at these girls and wish I could be the one doing it with them.\nDONNA: Well, keep hoping. You might find a local girl.\nEINSTEIN: So, if I’ve read your note correctly, you got all three daughters to pose?\nDONNA: Yeah. You want to see Melani’s next?\nEINSTEIN: She must be the seven-year-old?\nDONNA: Yeah!\nEINSTEIN: Do you know the number on it?\nDONNA: It’s the next one up….144.\nEINSTEIN: 144. Very good! And just to explain again, we tell you these numbers so you can find them and look at them with us. And maybe share an opinion or two. (Einstein changes the URL and clicks return.) Another redhead. Very nice, Donna!\nDONNA: Thank you. I am a redhead, by the way. That would explain why all three daughters are redheads.\nEINSTEIN: Melani’s very pretty, Donna. Very beautiful body. Her ass is as good as Stephani’s.\nDONNA: Yeah, and she can take a penis in, too.\nEINSTEIN: So Melani did it, too?\nDONNA: Yeah. One of our neighbors came over and had some fun with me. Then I told him I wanted him to do one of my daughters. And he chose Melani.\nEINSTEIN: He chose wisely. What a babe! (Einstein looks at Melani’s picture with a man’s penis up into her vagina.) Damn! It’s almost all the way in. I tell you what…these girls…Stephani and Melani sure aren’t tight at all.\nDONNA: No, they get a lot of practice from my husband and his friends.\nEINSTEIN: And then you have a four-year-old?\nDONNA: Yep, her name is Destini. Number 145. I knew you were going to ask.\nEINSTEIN: (changes URL to 145.) Oh…oh…ohhhhh! Nice little girl. Wonderful little cherub type body. Love the slit on her. And I like the little ball in her belly button.\nDONNA: Yeah, Timmy loves it, too.\nEINSTEIN: Who’s Timmy?\nDONNA: He’s our neighbor’s kid. We let him fuck Destini for the camera.\nEINSTEIN: Man, that Timmy is one lucky guy. I don’t know of many guys who fuck four-year-olds. So, you all decided to do this.\nDONNA: Yeah! And then as we went along, we thought we’d share with our neighbor and let him come over for a screw or two.\nEINSTEIN: Well, Donna, you are lucky to have three sexy llittle girls.\nDONNA: Thank you, Einstein!\nEINSTEIN: If you ever plan a trip to New York, let us know. We can help you, and even get you in the studio.\nDONNA: Awesome, Einstein! Thank you!\nEINSTEIN: Well, thank you for calling in! It was a nice surprise! Take care, Donna, and have a great weekend!\nDONNA: You too, Einstein! Bye, sweetie!\nEINSTEIN: Bye! She called me sweetie. Let’s see here….one more before the break…..how about…..number 72 from nine-year-old Jennie. Jennie wrote this herself. I guess her parents don’t know.\nHi, Einstein!\nI had heard about your “Show and Tell” project and thought that I would contribute. I had my friends, Tara and Emily, take these pictures for me. As you can see by looking through them, I had a very busy day, but I enjoyed doing everything. *wink wink* Well, Tara dared me to take my clothes off in class. I did, and she got many pictures of my naked little body. My teacher saw that I was naked and had me come up in front of the class. She paraded me around so everyone could see and feel everything. I’ve never had so many hands touching my belly, my kitty, or my butt in my life. Then she surprised me by picking a boy from the class, and having him come up next to me. And well…..you can see what happened.\nI’m gonna stop there for a minute and see what she’s talking about. First off, Jennie is a very lovely girl. Brown hair and blue eyes. And she’s got a smokin’ little body. Very big smile, along with her tight tummy, little slit and little butt. Now I scroll down and see that a boy has a nice hard looking penis out from his jeans. And then Jennie gives the boy a blow job in class. And she’s nine years old. Which means she’s finishing third grade. So some little third grade boy got a big present from this teacher, having his dick sucked in class.\nShe contined:\nYeah, I got to suck his little cock.\nHow does she know the word ‘cock’?\nBut for me, the best part was getting fucked in class by another boy.\nAnd that guy really got the prize. Jennie has a little pussy to die for.\nAnd don’t forget that if you’re a girl, under eighteen, you can contribute to “Show and Tell”. Just take some nude pictures of you and send them along with a short paragraph or two about them. Maybe what you were doing or feeling. Something like that. Then submit them through the website at einsteinshow.net. We’ll post them up for everyone to see your naked self. And, guys, don’t forget you can comment and even request pictures from other girls. That’s “Show and Tell”, a great service of einsteinshow.net and “The Einstein Show”! I’ve just been told that the Kidsville, USA kids from Florida will be coming in after the break. Why? Must be Mikey D’s doing. Be right back with more of “The Einstein Show”.\n–3:50–\nEINSTEIN: Back with more of “The Einstein Show”. I guess Mikey D is playing with the clock a little bit today because the Kidsville, USA kids from Florida are here! Eric Reilly of Lakeland, Florida is the guy who wrote a controversial play that was performed in Winter Haven at Beecher Elementary. Kidsville, USA is controversial because it was performed first for like the first and second graders, then the third through fifth graders, and then the parents at night. And it contains profanity (as if we don’t say “fuck”, “shit”, and “ass” here enough), nudity, sex, and some pee. Now, Eric, what was the idea behind writing Kidsville, USA\nERIC REILLY: Well, I thought it might be fun to write a sexy play involving kids. Call it the Oh, Calcutta of 2013. So, like the other play, I have the cast come out in robes. They do a silly number, then take the robes off to the shock of the audience.\nEINSTEIN: Now, we have five of the kids here. We have Natalie Jacobs, a ten-year-old fourth grader. Next to her is Devin Braswell, an eleven-year-old fifth grader. Next to Devin is Jasmine Howell, a nine-year-old fourth grader. Then we have Brian Simons, an eight-year-old second grader. And finally, Abby Walsh, a seven-year-old second grader. Welcome to all of you. I guess I’ll start with Natalie, since she’s closest to me. How in the world did you get involved in the play?\nNATALIE JACOBS: Well, they announced in our classes that we were going to do a play. Obviously, this one. But they didn’t tell us a whole lot about it. The only way anyone knew how bad or raunchy it was is if they went to auditions.\nEINSTEIN: Obviously, you all went to auditions or you wouldn’t be here. What happened at your audition, Natalie?\nNATALIE: Well, I read the little sheet that they wanted us to perform. And what got my attention is that my part was all in the nude.\nEINSTEIN: And I’ll bet you’re not used to that at all.\nNATALIE: I can’t speak for the other kids. I just know that being naked outside of a shower is very foreign to me. But they had me strip down in front of them.\nEINSTEIN: And I’ll bet that was nerve wracking.\nNATALIE: Yeah, I mean, who gets naked at school anyway.\nEINSTEIN: Well, apparently, you all did.\nNATALIE: But not at the time.\nEINSTEIN: No, of course not.\nNATALIE: But the judges checked me out in front and in back.\nEINSTEIN: Check out the ass.\nNATALIE: Yeah. And then they had me work with a boy who was also naked.\nEINSTEIN: So now, it’s really uncomfortable. First, you’re naked. Now there’s a boy involved and you must have been looking at his dick.\nNATALIE: Oh, yes! It was an okay dick. And they loved me, but they didn’t like him. So, Devin got that job.\nDEVIN: Yep.\nEINSTEIN: And so, how did your scenes work?\nDEVIN: Well, me and Natalie portrayed a newlywed couple.\nEINSTEIN: Which, I’m guessing means that you two are having sex in the scene.\nDEVIN: Fuck, yeah!\nNATALIE: Yeah! Did I mention he has a perfect dick?\nEINSTEIN: Well, does Vicki wanna look at it? Because the rest of us aren’t interested.\nVICKI: Not really. I mean he’s kind of cute for a white guy. But not really my type.\nEINSTEIN: Well, I tried, Devin.\nDEVIN: That’s okay, Einstein!\nNATALIE: Well, in the scene, we’re getting ready for bed. Devin’s in the “bathroom” taking a piss.\nDEVIN: Actual piss.\nEINSTEIN: So, the audience got to see it shooting out.\nDEVIN: Yep.\nEINSTEIN: Now, Eric, I’m curious as to why you included peeing in the play.\nERIC: I wanted to show all aspects. I wanted the audience to see the sex. I wanted the audience to see urination. I don’t hide anything just because children are involved. Let’s tell them and show them everything. We can’t keep them sheltered their whole lives.\nEINSTEIN: True. So, Natalie and Devin, you two did it on the stage.\nNATALIE: (smiling) Yeeeah!\nEINSTEIN: I take it from that response, Natalie, that you loved it.\nNATALIE: Yes!\nEINSTEIN: And what was the reaction from the crowd while you two were having sex?\nNATALIE: I wasn’t paying attention. I had a hard enough time with his his penis being in me.\nDEVIN: I could hear some shock from the audience. Like, I didn’t pay five or ten bucks to come watch kiddies fuck.\nNATALIE: I hadn’t told my parents about getting to fuck Devin. They were quite livid at first. Then they calmed down and said well done.\nDEVIN: Dad went to see it, and he was very proud of me.\nEINSTEIN: And we got a lot more with Eric Reilly and the Florida elementary cast of Kidstown, USA on “The Einstein Show” after this!\n–3:57–\nEINSTEIN: Like I said a little bit ago, Mikey D is playing with the clock today. Probably wants the last couple of minutes of the show for a big announcement. Find out the big announcement at 5:50. In the meantime, Kidstown, USA is here, plus Texas belles Donna, Kristine, and Anne Marie will be here next hour. Stay tuned for more of “The Einstein Show” after this break for your local news.\n–4:06–\nEINSTEIN: Hey, kids! What time is it? (sounder: “It’s Einstein time!”) That’s right! And apparently, today is a big day according to producer Mikey D.\nMIKE DANIELS aka MIKEY D: That it is. You’ll want to stay tuned for a really big announcement about the show.\nEINSTEIN: About the show, huh?\nMIKEY D: Yeah, about the show. Not saying anything else until later.\nEINSTEIN: But whatever it is, it’s big enough to warrant a price increase on Einstein 24/7. The price is going up on Monday. So, if you want to see all the stuff we get to see and be a subscriber, you best do it now before the price goes up. It’s $49.95 a year right now, and $6.95 a month. I don’t know what it’s going to be after that. Don’t take the chance, and sign up now at einsteinshow.net. In the meantime, Vicki’s here along with Jay, Chris, and Dylan the Resident Lesbian. And we’re back with Eric Reilly, the writer of the play Kidsville, USA as well as several performers from an elementary school where it was done. We talked with Natalie Jacobs and Devin Braswell last hour. We’ll be talking with them again soon. But I want to chat with our other actors, Jasmine Howell, Brian Simons, and Abby Walsh. Jasmine just graduated from fourth grade. And I guess you have a summer birthday.\nJASMINE HOWELL: August 7th, I’ll be ten.\nEINSTEIN: And you got paired up with Brian in the play.\nJASMINE: Yep.\nEINSTEIN: And, how did you like being naked in the play.\nJASMINE: Like the others, I was very scared. But, as we rehearsed it, it became second nature.\nBRIAN: Plus someone like Jasmine can rev my little dick up.\nJASMINE: Awww…you’re so sweet.\nEINSTEIN: And were your parents like those that were like ‘We don’t want this play here’?\nJASMINE: My mom and dad weren’t pleased at all. They screamed at me after we did the last performance.\nEINSTEIN: What did they scream at you?\nJASMINE: Hussy, dick sucker, semen collector.\nEINSTEIN: That sounds like a badge of honor.\nJASMINE: Maybe so, but not at the time.\nEINSTEIN: Did they ever calm down?\nJASMINE: The next day. They apologized for the screaming and supported me for doing the play. They just didn’t like the fact I was buck naked and having sex on stage. But I loved the sex with Brian. Even got to give him a blow job.\nBRIAN: She can sure suck a cock really good, Einstein.\nEINSTEIN: What did your parents think, Brian?\nBRIAN: They seemed to like it. Which I thought was weird.\nEINSTEIN: Did either of you pee on stage?\nJASMINE: I did.\nEINSTEIN: You got to do that. Was that odd? I mean the script called for it.\nJASMINE: Yeah, it did. And it kind of weird having to stand up and crouch over the toilet so that everyone could see it.\nEINSTEIN: And you probably had to drink enough water to pee on command.\nJASMINE: Yeah.\nEINSTEIN: And Devin, too.\nDEVIN: Yep!\nEINSTEIN: Down there on the end is Abby Walsh. How are you, Abby?\nABBY WALSH: I’m fine.\nEINSTEIN: So you’re seven years old?\nABBY: Uh-huh!\nEINSTEIN: And you turn eight pretty soon?\nABBY: Next week, I’ll be eight!\nEINSTEIN: And how did you get in the play.\nABBY: I try out an’ see if I’m any good.\nEINSTEIN: Did you like taking your clothes off for the judges?\nABBY: No. But it was part of play.\nEINSTEIN: Yes, it was. Now they tell me your scene was different.\nABBY: Uh-huh! They had me swing on swingset naked.\nEINSTEIN: Swinging naked?\nABBY: Yep!\nEINSTEIN: Yeah, that would be different and strange.\nABBY: Yeah. Then I walk on stage and wonder where Romeo is.\nEINSTEIN: I can assume Romeo shows up.\nABBY: Uh-huh. An’ you know wha’ he does?\nEINSTEIN: What’s that?\nABBY: Puts fingers up in my peepee. Then he put his peepee in my peepee.\nEINSTEIN: And so, you’re also having intercourse on stage.\nABBY: Uh-huh!\nEINSTEIN: Did mommy and daddy not like that?\nABBY: They didn’t like it at all.\nEINSTEIN: I can understand. They want Princess to be pure and clean. The problem is, these days, that’s very hard to do. We’re gonna talk more with Eric Reilly and the kids after Daft Punk.\n(“Get Lucky” plays.)\nEINSTEIN: “Gettin’ Lucky” on “The Einstein Show”. Well, there’s about five of us who think we’re gonna get lucky today. I don’t know. But I do know that you need to check out Playdate this month. In the July issue, the sun shines on the Sunshine State with “The Girls of Florida”, porn actress Desiree Gonzalez, and the newest Playdate of the Month, Anna Herbert. And while you’re at the newsstand, pick up the new issue of Playdate Pajamas Party and see new pictures of your favorite models like Terri Adams, Angela Bock, Katherine Orozco, Emma Correa, and Emily Minnick. Plus Playdate Casting Calls has the newest girls from Seattle, Chicago, Boston, and Cleveland. That’s Playdate magazine available on newsstands everywhere and at the Loliwood Stores throughout America. More with Eric Reilly of Kidsville, USA and the kids after this. It’s “The Einstein Show” and we’re coming back.\n–4:20–\nEINSTEIN: Back with “The Einstein Show”. Our guests in the studio for a couple more segments are Eric Reilly, writer of a play called Kidsville, USA, and five young kids who performed the play at a Florida elementary school to shocked faces and lots of yelling about the content of the play.\nDYLAN: I’ve been listening to this and I have no problem with the play. In fact, there was something missing.\nEINSTEIN: Wait! I know! I know! Two little girls kissing and fondling and having sex.\nDYLAN: Damn, I’m too fucking transparent! You think?\nEINSTEIN: Uhhhh…..yeah! Anyway, Eric, so you’ve got this play. And this school in Florida does the play and the audiences didn’t seem to like it, or didn’t like the sex, or the nudity, or the language. Did other schools come up to you and inquire about the play?\nERIC: Yeah, we had some in California, especially in southern California, where apparently this is considered normal behavior.\nEINSTEIN: That is true. There are some parts of California where nude is normal and sex is practiced openly.\nERIC: Yeah, and then we got some questions from a school in Oregon, and another in Oklahoma.\nEINSTEIN: And I guess they didn’t have a problem with it.\nERIC: Well, we never heard back from the Oklahoma school. If there would be an issue, it would have been Oklahoma. We didn’t expect anything from California because, as you said, nudity is normal and sex is out in the open. Even peeing is out in the open a bit.\nEINSTEIN: You know, I keep seeing the girls here, and they’re hot as hell. Damn, I got to have one of them.\nERIC: Go ahead.\nEINSTEIN: Natalie, come on over here, sweetie. (Natalie gets up from the couch.)\nJAY: Hey, Einstein, as long as we’re picking up girls, can I have Abby?\nEINSTEIN: Oh, I’m pretty sure she won’t mind. Won’t you, Abby?\nABBY: Love to.\nEINSTEIN: Hey, Chris, you want Jasmine?\nCHRIS: Sure!\nEINSTEIN: Hey, Eric, you might want to get out of the way and let Jay and Chris have the couch.\nERIC: A great idea. At least I get to watch them. (Eric gets up and walks to a hanging microphone.)\nDYLAN: I don’t suppose I could try them out, too?\nEINSTEIN: Well, maybe after we get done with them. (Natalie hops in Einstein’s lap.) Hey, honey.\nNATALIE: Hey, Einstein!\nEINSTEIN: So, I know you got a little dick when you did the show, right?\nNATALIE: Yeah.\nEINSTEIN: Well, I got a big dick you can use.\nNATALIE: You do? Can I suck on it?\nEINSTEIN: You can suck on it all you want. Want to see it?\nNATALIE: Yes!\nJAY: (has removed his clothes and sits next to Abby.) You like, Abby?\nABBY: (feels Jay’s naked chest and tummy.) Mmmmmm……\nJAY: Can I see you? (Abby nods. Jay takes off Abby’s t-shirt.) God, you’re so fucking gorgeous.\nABBY: More?\nEINSTEIN: (pulls down his jeans and underwear and reveals his six-inch hard dick.) You like my dick?\nNATALIE: Oh I love…..(begins sucking on Einstein’s wood.)\nCHRIS: (naked with Jasmine sucking on his penis.) Oh, God! She may be….the middle girl…..of the group……but she surely……knows how to blow.\nEINSTEIN: (with Natalie working on his fuse.) Oh, God! Fuck! Yeah, Natalie! Keep going like that, baby!\nJAY: (with Abby doing his pecker.) Oh, Jesus! Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!\nDYLAN: Well, since the boys are busy, I’ll take over. You don’t mind, Einstein?\nEINSTEIN: Nah, go…..ahead, Dylan.\nDYLAN: Well, it’s not too crazy in here right now. They’re just getting serviced. Abby’s only missing a shirt. The other girls aren’t showing anything……yet. But I bet that changes. Eric, since I’m the only of without a girl at the moment, was it kind of like this during the play?\nERIC: Oh, yeah! The guys were quite pleased with the girls working on their sex bombs. Then they let loose when they stuck them in the girls.\nDYLAN: I see! And is that when the parents really got the most upset.\nERIC: Yeah. It was almost a riot during the parents’ performance. Not so much with the kids, although some were horrified at the boys being in the girls.\nDYLAN: Einstein, how is she doing?\nEINSTEIN: Natalie is just great…..I can feel her tongue on the tip…..Like she’s licking up the liquid.\nDYLAN: Fuckin’ nice! Go get ’em, Natalie!\n(Plenty of moaning can be heard from the three couples.)\nDYLAN: Not only does Einstein love it, but I think Jay and Chris do as well.\nJAY: Uh-huh!….God, Abby…..is an angel.\nCHRIS: Jasmine rocks…..Oooooh!……..\nDYLAN: Einstein is having way….too…much…fun.\nNATALIE: Hey, Einstein. Come put it in.\nEINSTEIN: You bet I will.\n(Einstein takes his shirt off and stands naked while removing Natalie’s clothes.)\nDYLAN: Wow, Einstein! You look marvelous!\nEINSTEIN: Thank you, Dylan. I think it’s from working out.\nDYLAN: I think Jay is about ready to ravish Abby.\n(Jay pulls Abby’s jeans and underwear off. Chris takes Jasmine’s clothes off. Einstein puts Natalie’s clothes aside and inserts his manhood inside her little kitty.)\nDYLAN: And there goes Einstein. Man, I never noticed how fit and sexy he was until just now. And his johnson is now safely inside Natalie…..Looks like Jay is ready to do the same with little Abby.\n(Jay’s dick enters Abby’s lovesack.)\nDYLAN: Damn, he got it all the way in there. How long is your dick, Jay?\nJAY: Long enough. Can’t be that much off from Einstein.\nDYLAN: Okay. Just wondering since it went all the way. Chris, how are you coming with Jasmine?\nCHRIS: Getting ready to go.\nJASMINE: Bring it on, baby!\n(Chris sticks it in Jasmine’s pussy.)\nDYLAN: Well, now we have a full-blown orgy.\nMIKEY D: Dylan, we got to take a break.\nDYLAN: Oh, it’s the bottom of the hour already? Back with more of “The Einstein Show”…..maybe Einstein will tell us about the experience….after this news break.\n–4:34–\nEINSTEIN: Back with more of…..“The Einstein Show”….Oh my God! That was fucking awesome!\nJAY: Yeah!\nCHRIS: Woohoo!!\nEINSTEIN: During the break, I got to fuck Natalie, Jay got to fuck Abby, and Chris fucked Jasmine. I think I’m one of the few talk show hosts to actually host naked. Now, Dylan’s getting in on this. She’s fucking Natalie. The rest of us are watching. Damn, look at her licking up Natalie’s kitty. How do like the attention from Dylan, Natalie?\nNATALIE: Ooooh, she’s great, Einstein! Thank you!\nEINSTEIN: Oh, I just thought of something. Hey, Abby, wanna have fun with me?\nABBY: Can I?! Oh can I?!\nEINSTEIN: Come on over here.\n(Einstein gets up from his chair and picks up Abby off the floor. He carries her back over to his work area and puts her on the ground.)\nEINSTEIN: Here you go, Abby. (He pulls on his penis and urges Abby to suck on it. She obliges.)\n(In the meantime, Dylan has finished licking Natalie’s pussy and starts sucking on her little buds and her belly. Natalie giggles from the touch.)\nJAY: Hey, Dylan, move over. How about a double team?\nDYLAN: Sure! Come on over!\nNATALIE: Oh my God! Two of you.\nDYLAN: Yeah, baby! You get his hard stick in your pussy, and me all over the rest of you.\nNATALIE: God, you make that sound so wonderful.\nDYLAN: It’s what I do best, sweetie. Jay, lay down on the floor. Then let her slide on top of your penis.\n(Jay lays down. He helps Natalie manouver over his penis. Once lined up, Natalie lowers herself on down, allowing it to enter her sacred throne.)\nVICKI: Something tells me I better jump in here. First off, lemme sayy what a circus this is in here. Little Abby is sucking Einstein’s dick. Now, we’ve got Natalie on top of Jay and…..\n(Dylan frenches Natalie while the little girl continues to go up and down on Jay.)\nVICKI: Fuck, this is getting crazy. Like I said, Natalie’s on top of Jay. Now Dylan’s sucking Natalie’s face.\nCHRIS: Damn! Even Einstein is fuckin’ naked! When the hell was the last time that happened?\nVICKI: Been awhile I think.\n(Abby finishes servicing Einstein.)\nVICKI: Einstein, how was she?\nEINSTEIN: Marvelous! A great cocksucker.\nCHRIS: Any chance I have Abby?\nEINSTEIN: I suppose you could, though the Texas Belles are coming up. I was wondering if you should save it for them.\nCHRIS: Sadly, you’re right, Einstein.\nEINSTEIN: We have in the studio Eric Reilly, writer of the play Kidsville, USA, along with some of the kid actors from a Florida elementary school who performed the play butt naked for their classmates and parents. We have little Abby Walsh, Brian Simons, Jasmine Howell, Devin Braswell, and Natalie Jacobs. Hey, Natalie, have you ever thought of being in porn?\nNATALIE: You think I could do porn?\nEINSTEIN: God, the way you sucked my dick?! Fuck, yeah.\nNATALIE: I tell you, Einstein. When they said we were coming up here to see you and talk about the play, I secretly hoped you and I would fuck.\nEINSTEIN: Awww…you did?!\nNATALIE: Yeah.\nEINSTEIN: Well, I’m glad you got the chance to fuck me. Our four million listeners thank you. How about you, Jasmine? Would you ever want to do porno flicks?\nJASMINE: That has crossed my mind. I’m not sure my parents would approve.\nEINSTEIN: Who said they had to approve? Just find another actress and tell you parents that you’re going over to their house. Fuck, I think most of the pornos are being done at kids’ houses instead of a studio.\nJASMINE: You do raise a good point.\nEINSTEIN: Abby, I’ll bet you’d do some porn.\nABBY: Uh-huh. I love when penis inside.\nEINSTEIN: I’ll bet you do! I know you’re great with cock.\nNATALIE: I’d love to do porn, Einstein.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, babe, you’re perfect for porn. Ride it for all its’ worth. So, Eric, do you have any plans to write more plays?\nERIC: Oh, I’m always running with some ideas in my head for scripts and stuff. I’m not sure any of them necessarily lend themselves to a play. But maybe a short film?\nEINSTEIN: Oooh! Pornos! I got your actresses right here! Natalie, Jasmine, and Abby! And, God, they’re so fuckin’ sexy hot.\nABBY: Thank you.\nEINSTEIN: You know, they’re sitting back down on our couch, butt naked. Devin and Brian are having a little fun feeling their tummies and kitties.\nDEVIN BRASWELL: I love feeling them. Their tummies are quite soft.\nEINSTEIN: And I notice you like to stick your finger in their belly buttons.\nDEVIN: What can I say? I’m that type of guy.\nEINSTEIN: And about half the room is naked. Me, and Chris, and Jay, and the girls. Strangely, Dylan ate pussy without getting naked.\nDYLAN: Well, I wanted to eat some pussy. Doesn’t mean I have to get naked.\nEINSTEIN: No.\nDYLAN: Well…..see?\nEINSTEIN: All right. Well, we want to say thanks to Eric Reilly for dropping in. I’m sorry for turning it into a circus.\nERIC: Oh, that’s okay, Einstein. Besides, it gave you a chance to fuck with my actresses.\nEINSTEIN: Very true! And we want to thank Natalie Jacobs, Abby Walsh, and Jasmine Howell for coming in.\nNATALIE: You’re very welcome, Einstein.\nEINSTEIN: And we can hope they all go into porn.\nABBY: Yeah, do porn!\nJASMINE: Would love to do it.\nNATALIE: I’m so there.\nEINSTEIN: And we thank Devin Braswell and Brian Simons for coming and watching the festivities. Too bad you couldn’t participate.\nBRIAN: Well, that’s okay. It’s your show. You should be able to fuck ’em if you want.\nEINSTEIN: Coming up after this break, our Texas Bells, Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie. And don’t be surprised if there’s even more nudity. This is a great day to get Einstein 24/7. Get a whole year right now for $49.95.

But if you want to see all the action live on your computer or i-phone, get Einstein 24/7 today for just $49.95 for a full year of debauchery. And, hey, get it right now during the break and see the Texas Belles fully nude. Einstein 24/7 can be found at einsteinshow.net. Back with the Texas Belles after this on “The Einstein Show”.\n–4:50–\nEINSTEIN: Back with “The Einstein Show”. We have a naked Einstein, that’s me of course. We also have a naked Chris, and a naked Jay. Dylan still has her clothes on.\nDYLAN: Well, maybe not for long from the way you talk about the Texas Belles.\nEINSTEIN: Wait ’til you see them. I forgot we hired you the week after they were here last year. (Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie walk into the studio totally naked while a fanfare plays.) WOW! Look at you, girls!\nDYLAN: HO-LY SHIT!\nEINSTEIN: Fuckin’ nice!\nDONNA WHITLEY: Thank you!\nEINSTEIN: How are you girls doing?\nKRISTINE WHITLEY: Great! How are you doing, Einstein?\nEINSTEIN: Awesome! I can’t complain. A lot of pussy coming in today.\nANN MARIE ELLIS: I heard that there’s supposed to be some big announcement today.\nEINSTEIN: Yeah, Mikey D has been working on something…..without telling me…..\nMIKEY D: Einstein, I wanted to give you a great surprise. I can’t very well do that if I tell you everything.\nEINSTEIN: Next hour, Mikey D. Next hour.\nMIKEY D: Absolutely, boss. You’re just gonna flip over what we’ve got for you.\nEINSTEIN: So, I guess I should ask, not so much for us because we know but because some in our audience don’t know, how old you are now?\nDONNA: I turned 16 in April.\nKRISTINE: I just turned 14 this month.\nANN MARIE: And I’m 14. I’m one of the fools with a fall birthday. I’ll be 15 in October.\nEINSTEIN: So, Donna, you’re just learning how to drive.\nDONNA: Yeah. Hopefully, I learn how not to kill people on the highways.\nEINSTEIN: Welll, where you live there aren’t many highways.\nDONNA: That’s true. We do live out in the country a bit. We’re many miles from a freeway. We live in a pretty small city. You know, we have many of the same stores, and fast food chains that most of the kids in the audience are familiar with.\nEINSTEIN: And one thing, Kristine, that you all do is you go out and get naked in public.\nKRISTINE: Oh yeah! We love to do that.\nEINSTEIN: Now, I should note that Donna and Kristine are sisters. Ann Marie is Kristine’s best friend.\nANN MARIE: That’s right.\nEINSTEIN: And so, where do you all go to get naked in public?\nKRISTINE: Well, we might go to the local Home Depot.\nDONNA: Yeah, I’ve been naked there several times.\nEINSTEIN: Who normally takes you?\nDONNA: Most of the time, it’s Dad. But sometimes, Mom will.\nEINSTEIN: I see. And how do you get naked without people seeing you?\nDONNA: We try to be careful to have no one see while we flash or get naked. But sometimes we get caught. About half the time, they’ll just watch. The other half would just get away.\nKRISTINE: Well, last week, I went to Safari Sam’s with Mom. It’s a big grocery store with a lot of stuff in it. And they have animatronic characters who do different things. Anyway, so I posed naked with the animatronic Elvis. While Mom’s taking the picture, some boys and their mom come along and see me.\nEINSTEIN: Nice! I should say you have some nice tits now. What size are those.\nKRISTINE: They are 36D.\nEINSTEIN: Fuck yeah! So, you’re naked and these boys see you.\nKRISTINE: Obviously, they’re surprised by this. Their mom didn’t know what to do. I let them pose with me. Then my Mom got the idea to have them take their shirts off.\nEINSTEIN: Could you tell how old they were?\nKRISTINE: Kinda young for me. I think one was ten, and the other was seven. Maybe if I were younger, it wouldn’t be as bad. Anyway, so Mom took a picture and their mom took a picture on her phone. Then for some reason, their mom decided to have them drop their jeans and underwear. So, I’m standing between two naked little boys, though their little dicks looked enticing. In the meantime, one or two shoppers had passed by. They didn’t say anything to us. We don’t know if they talked to the manager.\nEINSTEIN: Wow!\nKRISTINE: Anyway, so the moms got the pictures, and we quickly got dressed.\nEINSTEIN: I’m surprised you got away with a lot.\nKRISTINE: Well, it helps that we have friends who work for the store. They cover for us.\nEINSTEIN: We’ll have more with our Texas Belles coming up. More of “The Einstein Show” coming right up!\n–4:57–\nEINSTEIN: Don’t forget that next hour, Mikey D is going to have a really big announcement.\nMIKEY D: Earth shattering announcement.\nEINSTEIN: Earth shattering?\nMIKEY D: Okay….maybe not earth shattering. But definitely one that you want to stay tuned for.\nEINSTEIN: And our Texas Belles, Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie all return right after the news on “The Einstein Show”.\n–5:06–\nEINSTEIN: Hey, kids! What time is it? (sounder: “It’s Einstein time!”) That’s right! And sometime this hour, Mikey D has a big announcement about the show. It’s apparently so big it’s triggering a price increase on Einstein 24/7. So, if you hurry right now to einsteinshow.net and sign up for Einstein 24/7 for a year, you can lock in a rate of $49.95. I don’t know what the new rate is going to be, but I’m guessing it’ll be a lot more. So don’t wait. And besides, if you sign up now and switch over to the live feed, you can see me, and Jay, and Chris all butt naked along with the Texas Belles, Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie. That’s Einstein 24/7. Get it now before the price goes up on Monday, July 1st.\nLIZA FRANKLIN: (surprises everyone by walking into the studio) Hi, everybody!\nEINSTEIN: Liza’s here?!\nSTACI DYLAN (aka DYLAN): Holy shit! What are you doing here? (Dylan and Liza embrace)\nLIZA: Well, I wanted to come visit you. I hope you don’t mind.\nDYLAN: Oh, I don’t mind at all, sweetie. I’m just shocked that you’re here! (Liza and Dylan kiss.)\nEINSTEIN: And the plot thickens. Anyway, like I said, the Texas Belles are here! Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie. And did I mention they are naked?\nLIZA: Fuck yeah!\nDYLAN: Woohoo!\nEINSTEIN: Oh, God help us! We have two lesbians here! Anyway, more with the Texas Belles after Demi Lovato.\n(“Give Your Heart A Break” plays.)\nEINSTEIN: Demi Lovato on “The Einstein Show” with “Give Your Heart A Break”. Now, Liza came in right before the song. What in the world is going on with you two?\nLIZA: Well, you know we were talking with the ladies over here.\nEINSTEIN: Right.\nLIZA: And you know what we look like with no clothes on.\nEINSTEIN: Yep! Great looking bodies! And if you haven’t seen the pictures from a party they went to about a month ago, you should see them. They were both buck nekkid, as they like to say in Texas.\nDYLAN: Yep! And you all are still naked from the last hour.\nEINSTEIN: Yeah, we shagged some little girls right on the air.\nDYLAN: We thought…..why not?\n(Dylan and Liza remove their shirts.)\nEINSTEIN: WOW!!\nJAY: Fucking nice!\n(Off come their bras.)\nEINSTEIN: Holy shit! Check those tits out! Did we say what size they were?\nDYLAN: I’m a 36C. Liza is a 36D.\nEINSTEIN: God, why are you lesbians?\nLIZA: Because we love each other, and we love girls like you do, Einstein.\n(Next is their shorts.)\nEINSTEIN: Oh my God! Jay and Chris, are you guys checking this out?\nJAY: Fuck yeah!\nCHRIS: Hell yeah!\nVICKI HUBERT: Man, they’re getting down and dirty.\nEINSTEIN: Nah, just naked.\n(Finally, the panties come off.)\nDYLAN: Ta-daaaaa!!!\nEINSTEIN: Oh, my God! Liza is bald down there. Dylan’s got a little hair right above the slit.\nLIZA: Here, Einstein, check this out!\n(Liza turns around and shakes her ass for Einstein.)\nEINSTEIN: God, what an ass you have! You sure I can’t talk you into…..\nLIZA: No, Einstein.\nDYLAN: Hey, Einstein, I got something for ya!\n(Dylan turns around and shakes her ass, then pulls her butt cheeks aside to give Einstein a really good look at her ass hole.)\nEINSTEIN: Oh, man! This is really wild. I just saw Dylan’s ass hole.\nJAY: God, I wish I could lick it.\nEINSTEIN: Jay, now you’re really screwed in the head. Anyway, the Texas Belles are here. Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie dropping in today. They come by about once a year and tell stories about being naked in public. Have you all been naked at school.\nDONNA: Yeah, we all have.\nEINSTEIN: Really? ‘Cause I know your school isn’t one of those schools where this is allowed.\nDONNA: No, but sometimes they look the other way.\nEINSTEIN: I see.\nDONNA: Like one day after classes, I went out to the flagpole and stripped while everyone was boarding buses or getting picked up. My friend, Taylor, took the pictures of me.\nEINSTEIN: No one said anything about you doing that?\nDONNA: Nope.\nEINSTEIN: What about you, Kristine?\nKRISTINE: Ann and I do it quite often. This last year, we were classmates in English with Mr. Vincent. He seemed amused when we came in on Fridays and took our shirts off. Then when we started getting more naked, he got happier and happier.\nEINSTEIN: Looking at you three, I’d be happy to see you naked.\nANN: Sometimes, Kristine and I would stay after class, and we’d have some fun with him. He might fondle our ass, or we’d give him a blow job.\nEINSTEIN: Really? Did you do it for a grade?\nANN: He says no. I’m not so sure.\nEINSTEIN: I see. We have plenty more with the Texas Belles. Plus you can call us at 1-855 EINSTEIN. That’s 1-855-346-7834, and ask a question of the ladies. Back with more of “The Einstein Show” after this.\n–5:18–\nEINSTEIN: Back with more of “The Einstein Show” with the Texas Belles, Donna Whitley, Kristine Whitley, and Ann Marie Ellis. Mikey D said during the break that he will make the big announcement after the news break. That’s about fifteen minutes away. So stay tuned. He tells me, and I have no reason to question him, that’s it’s the biggest announcement in the history of the show. So big it’s triggering a price hike on Einstein 24/7. Get it before Monday, and you’ll save by not paying whatever the new price is. $49.95 for a year of debauchery and naked fun. We’re having some naked fun with the Texas Belles. Of course, they’re naked. I am, and Jay, and Chris. Then, in the last segment, Liza joined us. And she and Dylan got naked. So, we seem to have a studio filled with naked people.\nVICKI: Wait a second….\nEINSTEIN: (giggles)\nVICKI: I just wanted to make sure my clothes were still on………..Yep! Still on.\nMIKEY D: Mine aren’t going anywhere either.\nEINSTEIN: No, but the rest of us are. And I know we have some callers that want to talk to the ladies. Chad in Kansas, you’re on “The Einstein Show” with the Texas Belles.\nCHAD: Hi, ladies! Hi, Einstein!\nDONNA, KRISTINE, and ANN: Hi, Chad!\nCHAD: Surely, you have friends, guys and girls, that like to get naked with you.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, we could easily spend a whole hour just on that. Too bad, we can only schedule guests for an hour.\nDONNA: True! But my boyfriend, Sean, and his sister Sarah, and I are part of a website called “Flashing 4 Fun”.\nEINSTEIN: Kind of like “Show And Tell”?\nDONNA: In a way. They give us dares, like flash on the road, or flash at the store, or flash on a bridge. There’s about a hundred of them. And, so we’ll go around looking for the place or the object.\nEINSTEIN: An object.\nDONNA: Yeah, sometimes it can be a clock, or a ruler, something with a measurement, or a real estate sign.\nEINSTEIN: You mean like out in front of the house?\nDONNA: Sure, or a big building. Or maybe even a field. Wherever we can find it, that’s where we go.\nEINSTEIN: Then what usually happens?\nDONNA: Well, we take turns. One of us will have the camera, and we’ll check with clothes on. Once we’re sure we’re good, then whoever’s getting their picture done will quickly strip. We’ll line the shot up again, take the picture, then they get dressed fast.\nKRISTINE: The easiest way, of course, is to not wear bra and panties. And the guys will already have their shirts off to save time.\nDONNA: Yeah, but like last week, Sean, Sarah, and I went to the mall. And we managed to get some inside the mall shots.\nEINSTEIN: Whoa! Did anyone see you.\nDONNA: We don’t know. But we found a little area that had no traffic. There was a bench that, I guess, used to face a store. Now, it faces a wall. Sean got the idea to sit down, take his shirt off, then his shorts. He’s nice and big there.\nEINSTEIN: I see. But go on.\nDONNA: So, I take the pictures while Sarah looks out for us. Then Sean and I change places. He gets my naked pictures, then it’s Sarah’s turn.\nEINSTEIN: Now, forgive my curiosity. You’re sixteen. How old is your boyfriend?\nDONNA: He’s seventeen.\nEINSTEIN: And how old is the sister, Sarah.\nDONNA: She’s thirteen.\nEINSTEIN: Awww….fuck! She sounds just perfect.\nDONNA: Oh, you should see her, Einstein. She is. Brunette, blue eyes, about five-eight.\nEINSTEIN: Holy shit! You’re saying she’s a tall girl.\nDONNA: Yep.\nEINSTEIN: And so, you did these pictures for the website, and you didn’t get caught?\nDONNA: We were very fortunate to have picked out a really good place to do it.\nEINSTEIN: Kristine, do you have a story or two?\nKRISTINE: I’m like my sister in that I’m also a member of “Flashing 4 Fun”, as is Ann Marie. Well, I have several more girl friends who flash with us.\nEINSTEIN: Last year, you talked about a girl named Leann and Alyssa, I think her name was.\nKRISTINE: Ah, yes! Leanna and Alyssa! Yeah, those two have surprised me a lot.\nEINSTEIN: How so.\nKRISTINE: Well, here’s the thing. During our first flashing trip with them two years ago, they said they went to a Baptist church.\nEINSTEIN: That is weird. I didn’t think holy rollers approved of nudity and whatever else.\nKRISTINE: So, we took them to a Jiffy Lube. And after a little coaxing from a customer, they were both naked. It seemed after that they couldn’t stop flashing. Next we took them to a McDonalds, where we all got naked with their manager. He got naked with us, too.\nEINSTEIN: I see. And how many girls were on the trip?\nKRISTINE: Six. Me, and Ann, and Leanna, and Alyssa, and Sandra, and Mom.\nEINSTEIN: And you all got to see a dick.\nKRISTINE: Yeah. And then we got to see another pussy from one of the other employees.\nANN: Yeah, after you pulled her pants down.\nKRISTINE: True! Then Leanna asked if we could go someplace to be naked for awhile. Mom took us to a wooded area by our house. We explored some trails naked and even skinny dipped in a pond.\nEINSTEIN: Nice!\nKRISTINE: Well, they loved it. They’re also a part of the website. Last week, they posted up new pictures of them outside the old school.\nEINSTEIN: Uh-huh. Oh, that’s right! You just graduated eighth grade and going to high school now.\nKRISTINE: Yeeesss!\nEINSTEIN: Very excited, I’m sure!\nKRISTINE: Yeah.\nDONNA: I’ve told my friends about Kristine and her little gang of flashers. They can’t wait to meet them.\nEINSTEIN: You pretty much have enough for a club.\nDONNA: Yeah, except they’re not allowed at our school.\nEINSTEIN: Well, who needs club status when you have plenty of people already who can spread the word.\nANN: Yep!\nKRISTINE: And I’ve heard the “L” word mentioned with their names, too.\nDYLAN: Really? I thought you said these were Baptist girls.\nANN: They are. I think they just get so turned on being naked in front of each other that it’s gone into other things…..like sex….\nKRISTINE: I think it’s just an experimentation phase. I really don’t think it’ll end up that way. Now, I have another friend, Sandra. And about a year ago, she told me she had a younger half-sister who lives in a clothing-optional city in California.\nEINSTEIN: Yes, I’ve heard of it! It’s called Edenton, California. Maybe on a future vacation, Andrea and I will go visit.\nKRISTINE: She’s gone to see her sister, Dena, in California a couple of times. She’ll spend a whole week naked. They’ll go to the mall, to the amusement park, various stores around town. She even mentioned going to people’s homes and having sex.\nEINSTEIN: Really? Holy shit! Just random people?\nKRISTINE: Well, not very random. Only people that Dena knows and trusts.\nEINSTEIN: But she’ll find some guy and he’ll bang her.\nKRISTINE: She’s been known to suck women, too.\nEINSTEIN: Another lesbian,\nKRISTINE: No, but there’s lots of bisexual women in Edenton, including the little girls like Dena.\nEINSTEIN: Okay, and how old is Dena?\nKRISTINE: I believe she’s nine years old. She has some friends who are going into the eighth grade now.\nEINSTEIN: A pretty big group of friends. I’ll bet they fuck each other a lot.\nKRISTINE: They do.\nEINSTEIN: Anyway, I do have to take a break here. And when we come back, Mikey D is going to tell us the big announcement. I don’t even know what the big announcement is. So, I’m just as interested as all of you. We’ll be back for the announcement and more with the Texas Belles after this bottom of the hour news break. “The Einstein Show” returns after this.\n–5:34–\nEINSTEIN: We’re back with more of “The Einstein Show”. We have a pretty full studio crew here. I’m here, of course. Jay’s here, along with Chris, Dylan, Liza, Vicki, and Mikey D. And we have the Texas Belles with us. They are Donna Whitley, Kristine Whitley, and Ann Marie Ellis. And Mikey D is in the studio because he has a big announcement. My apologies to the Texas Belles. I hope this is worth interrupting their appearance.\nMIKEY D: I think this is very well worth the wait. First off, how long have been on the air?\nEINSTEIN: Two years. We started with you, Jay, Vicki, and Chris. We added Dylan last year.\nMIKEY D: Okay. And what’s the one thing I always hear from you about the show.\nEINSTEIN: Besides the fact that you’re sometimes lazy?\nCREW: (giggles)\nMIKEY D: No. Seriously, what’s the one thing I hear most about.\nEINSTEIN: Well, when we have a good segment, we never have enough time.\nMIKEY D: Right. And I’m here to help solve that.\nEINSTEIN: Like you remember when we did that “Strip Poker” segment?\nMIKEY D: And we had to rush it?\nEINSTEIN: Yeah.\nMIKEY D: Not anymore. I’m still planning on two or three guests per show. But the big news….ladies and gentlemen is……we’re going to four hours!\nEINSTEIN: Four hours?!\nMIKEY D: We’re going to four hours starting Monday. And now you know why Einstein 24/7 is going up. Because there’s going to be even more.\nEINSTEIN: That’s like….more fun around here.\nMIKEY D: That’s right. And the fourth hour will be from 6-7 PM Eastern time. But wait! There’s more!\nEINSTEIN: More?\nMIKEY D: Yes, we’ve gotten a lot of requests from various radio stations across the country to run the show in the mornings.\nEINSTEIN: You’re telling me I have to wake up at three in the morning?\nMIKEY D: Nope! But having a fourth hour made it possible to run the show on delay to the following morning for those stations that want it. What that means, of course, is more stations and more money for us.\nEINSTEIN: In which case, I want a raise!\nMIKEY D: I am happy to report you are getting a raise. We will have this to you before you go, so you can sign it. But you’re getting a hundred thousand dollar raise.\nEINSTEIN: YES!!!\nMIKEY D: Which means Einstein will be making $400,000 a year. And he’s very well worth it. Everyone else here is getting a one-third raise.\nLIZA: Well, except for me.\nMIKEY D: That’s true, of course, because Liza hasn’t been here. She is our newest….\nEINSTEIN: Are you kidding?! Liza got hired?!\nLIZA: Yes!\n(Dylan starts screaming at the good news, and hugs and kisses her girlfriend.)\nMIKEY D: She’s our newest member of the “Bunch of Crazies”. And it all becomes official on Monday, July 1.\nEINSTEIN: So what happens on Monday?\nMIKEY D: Our new morning stations will get a “Best Of” show that I’m gonna put together tomorrow. We will be back here at three o’clock on Monday afternoon for a full four hours. Those morning stations will get that show on Tuesday. Oh, by the way. you know that we usually have a song after the top of the hour news. I’m happy to say that we will no longer have the newsbreaks. Instead, we’ll have music there, and still leave you plenty of time to talk to the guests. And I’ve been working on a few minor things related to it, too.\nEINSTEIN: That is just awesome, Mikey D! As much shit as I throw at you, you deserve a big ups and round of applause from this “Bunch of Crazies”!\n(Recorded applause plays, along with applause from everyone in the studio.)\nMIKEY D: Thank you, everyone! I just hope that everything keeps up and we keep going and going.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, we will! Oh, that’s just fantastic news! And we’re back with the Texas Belles, Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie.\nDONNA: So now that you have another hour, does that give you all time for more sex with the girls?\nEINSTEIN: Yeah!\nKRISTINE: Well, come on, Einstein. What are you waiting for?\nMIKEY D: Einstein, if I may interrupt.\nEINSTEIN: Why not?\nMIKEY D: Well, I have an idea.\nEINSTEIN: Well, you can’t do the “Pick A Number” game since almost all of us are naked.\nMIKEY D: Don’t worry, I know. But we have you….and Jay….and Chris….and Dylan….and Liza….that’s five. And we have three girls. Would you mind having another naked guy in the studio?\nDONNA: I certainly wouldn’t mind! I think Mikey D looks pretty hot. Get those clothes off! Get that shirt off!\n(Mikey D unbuttons his shirt. Donna gets up and unfastens his pants.)\nEINSTEIN: Damn! Donna can’t seem to wait.\n(Donna pulls Mikey D’s underwear off.)\nKRISTINE: Nice!\nEINSTEIN: We now have three girls admiring Mikey D’s manhood.\nMIKEY D: So, now there’s six of us and three of them.\nEINSTEIN: Okay.\nMIKEY D: So, do we have a card deck? Standard sized, not “Strip Poker” sized.\nEINSTEIN: Yeah, I see one right here.\n(Einstein hands the deck to Mikey D.)\nMIKEY D: Alright. Lemme shuffle.\n(Mikey D. shuffles the deck four times.)\nMIKEY D: Okay, Einstein, cut the deck.\n(Einstein cuts the deck in the middle. Mikey D. restacks the deck.)\nMIKEY D: Okay, so here’s what we’re gonna do. We’re going to play high card. The winner of each play gets to choose Donna, Kristine, or Ann Marie. Each girl can be chosen twice. That’s about all the time we have left in this show.\nEINSTEIN: Okay. So let’s draw and see who gets the first choice. (Einstein draws….) An Ace!\nDYLAN: Well, we pretty much know we lost this round. I got an eight.\nLIZA: A four for me.\nJAY: I got a nine.\nCHRIS: Damn, I got a three.\nMIKEY D: And I got a seven.\nEINSTEIN: Oh, man! Who should I pick? Last time you were here, I did Donna. So, I think it’s Kristine’s turn.\nKRISTINE: YES!!! I get to fuck Einstein!\nEINSTEIN: Let’s finish out the game, then let the fun begin. Dylan, you’re first up to draw.\nDYLAN: I got another eight.\nLIZA: Oooh! A King!\nJAY: I got a three.\nCHRIS: An Ace!! YES!!\nMIKEY D: Man, I got a King and lost!\nEINSTEIN: So, Chris, you’ve got the second choice.\nCHRIS: Oh, it’s a fuckin’ easy choice. I’ll take Donna.\nEINSTEIN: Great choice, Chris. I mentioned I had her last year. Just awesome fucking. You’re gonna love fucking her.\nDONNA: I can’t wait!\nEINSTEIN: Okay, time for another round. Dylan starts again.\nDYLAN: Well, damn, it’s a seven this time.\nLIZA: I got a Jack.\nJAY: Yes! An Ace!\nEINSTEIN: Damn, that’s three aces so far. And Mikey D. gets…..\nMIKEY D: A Queen. An otherwise decent card that would have won if not for the Ace.\nEINSTEIN: Jay, who do you choose.\nJAY: I’m with you. I’ll take Kristine.\nEINSTEIN: Okay, so Kristine’s card is full. No one’s taken Ann Marie yet. But I expect that will change.\nDYLAN: I surely hope so.\nEINSTEIN: Let’s draw and see….\nDYLAN: Okay, I have an eight….again.\nLIZA: I’ve got a Jack!\nEINSTEIN: Well, our newest resident lesbian might be a winner. Mikey D?\nMIKEY D: I got a four.\nEINSTEIN: So Liza wins and gets the next choice.\nLIZA: Oh, I’m taking Ann Marie, baby.\nANN: Oooh! A girl! Nice! Have I ever mentioned about fucking Kristine.\nEINSTEIN: You and Kristine have fucked?\nKRISTINE: Oh yeah. She’s a great pussy muncher.\nANN: Well, Kristine is, too. And I’ll bet Liza can top her.\nEINSTEIN: Okay, so we have Mikey D and Dylan left. And Donna and Ann Marie have one slot each left. So, Dylan, let’s find out how this is going to end.\nDYLAN: I got a Jack!\n(drumroll sounder)\nEINSTEIN: And Mikey D gets…..\nMIKEY D: A Queen!\nDYLAN: NOOOOO!!!\nMIKEY D: (laughs.) Well, I’m gonna make this easy for everyone and take Donna. Dylan and Liza can take on Ann Marie.\nDONNA: Yeah! I get to have that pecker!\nVICKI: And I get to watch it all.\nEINSTEIN: Yeah, from your cozy little booth.\nANN: Damn, I get two lesbians!\nEINSTEIN: Not a bad deal, Ann Marie. We’re gonna take a break. And when we come back, let the fun begin! Fucking with the Texas Belles after this on “The Einstein Show”.\n–5:47–\nVICKI: Back with more of “The Einstein Show”. Obviously, I’m not Einstein. He’s about to go to work on Kristine of the Texas Belles. In fact, I’m the only not in on this. That’s kinda why I’m talking. Chris is about to take on Donna, and Liza is already sucking on Ann Marie’s tits. And what they told me was that each of the “Crazies” and Einstein would get five minutes each with their girl.\n(Kristine is in a doggy position. Einstein sticks his penis in from behind.)\nVICKI: Okay, Einstein fans, he just put it in Kristine. Hopefully, you’re watching this online, because you’ll see the whole thing. And, it’s better to watch than hear anyway.\n(Chris lays on Donna, missionary style and inserts his dick.)\nVICKI: And now Chris is doing it with Donna. I hear both Einstein and Chris making those sounds you hear in intercourse.\n(Liza and Ann Marie moan).\nVICKI: I can hear the girls and I look down and there’s Liza licking Ann Marie’s pussy.\nDYLAN: She’s doing great, Vicki. By the way, I must say what a nice ass Ann Marie has.\nANN MARIE: Ooooh! Oooooh! Thanks…….Dylan……..\nVICKI: Einstein’s really pushing it in. Oh my God, what’s going on?\n(Kristine starts moaning loudly. Einstein jams his pecker inside more and more.)\nVICKI: Kristine is getting loud. Must mean Einstein’s doing great work.\n(Donna starts getting louder, too, as Chris really penetrates the sixteen-year-old’s love nest.)\nVICKI: Damn, Chris! Nice going!\nKRISTINE: OOOH! OH SHIT! OH SHIT!\nDONNA: FUUUUUCK!!! FUUUUUUCK!! OOOH FUUUCK!!\nVICKI: They’re rally jammin’ them in there. You can tell by the loud screams.\nKRISTINE: OOOOH!!!\nVICKI: I think Kristine just orgasmed.\nDONNA: OOOOH!!! Oooooh!! Oooohh!\nVICKI: And Donna did, too.\nEINSTEIN: Okay, Jay and I are pulling out. Liza and Dylan switch. Here come Mikey D and Chris. We’re going to take a break and be right back with more of “The Einstein Show”.\n–5:56–\nEINSTEIN: Back with more of “The Einstein Show”. Right now, Mikey D is doing Donna, and Chris is inside Kristine. Dylan sucked on Anne Marie’s pussy during the break. Now she’s flipped her over and licking her asshole.\nVICKI: Dylan’s pretty wild today.\nEINSTEIN: And time is about up, everyone! How were they?\nDONNA: I loved my boys.\nEINSTEIN: Ann Marie, did you like the girls?\nANN MARIE: Oh, yes, Einstein. They were off the charts.\nEINSTEIN: And my sweet Kristine….\nKRISTINE: I loved having you inside me, Einstein. Thank you.\nEINSTEIN: So the big announcement is we’re going to four hours on Monday, and adding a morning feed for some stations. Plus more music and no more news. More time for guests and fucking.

  <div class="post-content"><p><strong>&ndash;3:06</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Hey, kids! What time is it? <em>(sounder: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Einstein time!&rdquo;)</em> That&rsquo;s right! And today, Mikey D is promising a historic announcement.</p>
<p>MIKE DANIELS aka MIKEY D: Welll, do you remember, it was at this time a month ago that I told you and the crew that I was working on something really special.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I do.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Well, thank God, that project is finished. And I will tell you before the show ends today just exactly what that project entailed. In the meantime, you remember about a month ago, a girl named Cooper called in. She said she and her basketball team wanted to pose nude for their annual program.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I remember that.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Well, I&rsquo;ve been pushing them back because of my project. But they will be here next Friday in the studio</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Did they say how many were coming?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: She got the whole team. Three coaches and a trainer included.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Wow! That&rsquo;s going to be a full show just with them!</p>
<p>DYLAN: So what you&rsquo;re saying is we&rsquo;re going to have a studio full of girls next Friday?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: It&rsquo;ll be like you died and went to heaven. Thirteen girls between twelve and fourteen, plus the four adults.</p>
<p>JAY HART: Damn, I&rsquo;m getting a hard on just thinking about it!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Pfffft! You&rsquo;re always getting hard because your brain is screwed up, Jay.</p>
<p>JAY: Yeah, that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Anyway, ooh! We have a great show today.</p>
<p>VICKI: Isn&rsquo;t every day a great show?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: No. But some are sexier than others. This looks like another great show to me. The first hour&rsquo;s kind of open. It&rsquo;ll give you a chance to call in and talk to us about anything. And we&rsquo;ll also have some &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo;. At least the tell part. I&rsquo;ll have to describe the show. And if you want to see what the hell I&rsquo;m talking about, head over einsteinshow.net and click on &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ve got a couple hundred girls, I think, Mikey D.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: We got about two to three hundred. That&rsquo;s pretty fair for a first month.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And we&rsquo;ll see how many we can get to before our studio guests get here. In the second hour, we have an interesting story. A Florida elementary school put on a play involving the kids, of course. The play was called <em>Kidsville, USA</em>, and involved the students stripping, fucking, using dirty language&hellip;.</p>
<p>DYLAN: You mean like we use here eveyday?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah. And using the toliet.</p>
<p>DYLAN: On stage?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Wow! Holy shit!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: The play was performed three times. And there was plenty of outrage after each show. I guess because when the name is <em>Kidsville, USA</em>, you don&rsquo;t think of sex, nudity, language, and pee.</p>
<p>DYLAN: True!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: We have the writer of the play, plus some of the actors from the show here in the studio.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Awesome! Maybe we can fuck with them.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Maybe. But maybe you want to save yourself for the third hour.</p>
<p>JAY: Really. What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>CHRIS COOPER: Hope it&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: In the third hour, our friends from Texas will be here.</p>
<p>JAY: Yes!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Our favorite southern girls, the Texas Belles as we like to call them, Donna, Kristine, and Anne Marie will be in the studio. And let me tell you if you&rsquo;ve never met them before. They like to get down, and get dirty,&hellip;&hellip;and get naked. If you don&rsquo;t have Einstein 24/7 yet, this would be a great day to get it. Just $49.95 for one year or $6.95 a month&hellip;.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Actually, Einstein, there&rsquo;s going to be a price increase on Einstein 24/7 on Monday.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Whoa! Is that a part of the big announcement?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Yes, and of course I&rsquo;ll explain later. But if you want Einstein 24/7 before the price goes up, and you&rsquo;ll understand why, head to the website now&hellip;.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: einsteinshow.net&hellip;.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Because Monday morning, it&rsquo;s going up. And can I make a recommendation to the listeners?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah.</p>
<p>MIKEY: The year long is a lot better.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I agree. So, like I said another great show! Let&rsquo;s kick it off with some Robin Thicke and &ldquo;Blurred Lines&rdquo; on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Blurred Lines&rdquo; plays)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Robin Thicke on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;. Almost as talented as his dad.</p>
<p>VICKI HUBERT: What? What do you mean almost?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, his dad is a musician, sometimes a singer, and an actor, and a game show host, and had a late night talk how.</p>
<p>VICKI: Who&rsquo;s his daddy?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Alan Thicke.</p>
<p>VICKI: Alan Thicke&hellip;you mean the guy from <em>Growing Pains</em>?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah.</p>
<p>VICKI: Oh, c&rsquo;mon, Robin&rsquo;s got so much soul.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: That&rsquo;s true. But you remember <em>Diff&rsquo;rent Strokes</em> and <em>The Facts Of Life</em>.</p>
<p>VICKI: Yeah.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, Alan wrote the theme music.</p>
<p>VICKI: Oh, he did?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah, and then if you go on to You Tube, and find really old, like 1970s episodes of <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>&hellip;..</p>
<p>VICKI: Wait, that show&rsquo;s been around since the seventies? Supposedly they&rsquo;re celebrating thirty years, which means it started in 1983. You know&hellip;when you were little.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, no. Way before that. In fact, ever heard of a guy named Chuck Woolery?</p>
<p>VICKI: Oh, he was the host on <em>Looooooooove Connection</em>.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yep. He was the original host.</p>
<p>VICKI: Really?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yep! Anyway, Alan wrote the theme music for that, too.</p>
<p>VICKI: Well, you sure know how to surprise me,</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Anyway, so like I said, the first hour is kind of open today. We always invite you to call in at 1-855-EINSTEIN. That&rsquo;s 1-855-346-7834. Maybe you got vacation plans and have a question. Maybe you have a fantasy you want to share. Whatever it is, let us hear from you at 1-855-EINSTEIN&hellip;1-855-346-7834. And also during this hour, we&rsquo;ll have some &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo; from the einsteinshow.net website. I&rsquo;ll tell you about some of the pictures that have been sent in. You can go see them for yourself and comment. Also, girls, you can send in your photos, whether topless, bottomless, or naked to einsteinshow.net and click on &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo;. Then click on the submission form. Oh, parents, it&rsquo;s okay to tell. But, only girls under eighteen can show. Boy, I just barely got the phone number out, and there&rsquo;s already a caller. Carly in Michigan, you&rsquo;re on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;.</p>
<p>CARLY: Hi, Einstein!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, hi, Carly!</p>
<p>CARLY: Do you &lsquo;memba when I called you last time?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Help me out, babe.</p>
<p>CARLY: When you had Tiffany on?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, that&rsquo;s right! Tiffany Roman was here. And you called in.</p>
<p>CARLY: Uh-huh, &lsquo;cuz I want to be like her.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, now I remember! I asked you how old you were. You said eight.</p>
<p>CARLY: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I thought it was kind of funny, because you listen to Carly and she sounds so sweet. Then she says &lsquo;I wanna be in porn&rsquo;.</p>
<p>CARLY: Yep!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Anyway, that was a month ago. Her mom, Amy, got you an audition there in Michigan.</p>
<p>CARLY: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And what happened?</p>
<p>CARLY: Well, mom took me to the studio. She watched.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: She watched knowing you were going to be totally, you know, violated.</p>
<p>CARLY: Yep!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And then what?</p>
<p>CARLY: Well, he asked questions. Then the man said to take clothes off. So I did. Then he took clothes off and said to suck his thing.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: His penis.</p>
<p>CARLY: Uh-huh, I suck his penis. Then he put penis in me. And he pushed it hard.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Wow! This is starting to sound like an adult porn audition, not a kid&rsquo;s. Anyway&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>CARLY: Well, it hurt for little bit, then go away.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Did you like his penis inside you?</p>
<p>CARLY: Uh-huh! Then when done, the lady took clothes off.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, this is getting a little interesting! What did she say?</p>
<p>CARLY: She want me to suck titties.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I see! Could you tell how big her tits were?</p>
<p>CARLY: They look big to me.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah, I guess you can&rsquo;t tell very well. Anyway, so you&rsquo;re sucking on her titties&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>CARLY: And licking on her nippies.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Nipples, I think. I would suck and lick a woman&rsquo;s nipples.</p>
<p>CARLY: Then she want me to stick tongue in her belly button.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Really? Haven&rsquo;t heard that happen too much. But they must have fans who like it. Did you get to suck her pussy?</p>
<p>CARLY: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: How was it?</p>
<p>CARLY: Very sweet.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Really? That&rsquo;s awesome!</p>
<p>CARLY: Then she lay me on couch and feel me, and suck nippies, and lick my belly button.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Did she go down on you?</p>
<p>CARLY: Yeah!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Did you orgasm?</p>
<p>CARLY: Uh-huh. I &lsquo;memba screaming.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Sounds like it. Seems like you did really well.</p>
<p>CARLY: Uh-huh. Did two films so far.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh wow! Have either of them come out yet?</p>
<p>CARLY: Not yet. Working on it.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Do you enjoy being a porn actress?</p>
<p>CARLY: Yeah! I like naked.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, you really like the naked part.</p>
<p>CARLY: Yeah.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, Carly, I&rsquo;m glad we were able to help you in your dream to be a porn star. We&rsquo;d love to have you in the studio when your films come out.</p>
<p>CARLY: Love to come see Einstein!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, you have a great evening, darlin&rsquo;! Thanks for calling!</p>
<p>CARLY: Bye, Einstein!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Bye, babe. Oh, man! Did you try to picture that? So vivid to me.</p>
<p>DYLAN: I&rsquo;d love to go down on her.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Just like you did at that party?</p>
<p>DYLAN: Yeah. Lick her cunt.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I&rsquo;d think about everyone in the studio, with the exception of Vicki, would want to have their way with Carly.</p>
<p>VICKI: Yeah, you know them little white girls don&rsquo;t interest me a bit. Bring me a brother with a real piece of meat.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Of course! I knew that! Probably some teen black boys.</p>
<p>VICKI: That&rsquo;s the best kind.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I swear Vicki&rsquo;s not usually like this. I better take another call. Jim in New York, you&rsquo;re on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;.</p>
<p>JIM: Hi, Einstein!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Hi, Jim! You must be one of our older listeners.</p>
<p>JIM: Yeah, I am.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh well! Old&hellip;young&hellip;we don&rsquo;t care. So, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>JIM: Well, you know the Supreme Court came out and said it was okay for gays to marry.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Right.</p>
<p>JIM: Well, do you think that will eventually include those of us who love kids?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: That&rsquo;s a great question. I know it&rsquo;s political. But it&rsquo;s a great question. I would think that the answer is yes.</p>
<p>JIM: I hope so, too, so I can marry my little lover.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, who&rsquo;s the lucky girl?</p>
<p>JIM: Her name is Sami. She&rsquo;s right here.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, really? Put her on. (Jim hands the phone to Sami.)</p>
<p>SAMI: Hi, Einstein!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Hi, Sami! How are you?</p>
<p>SAMI: I&rsquo;m doing fine now that I&rsquo;m with my big man.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I see! And how old are you?</p>
<p>SAMI: I&rsquo;m twelve.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Twelve sounds so perfect. So innocent looking, yet developed enough to cause problems.</p>
<p>SAMI: Yep! That&rsquo;s me!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So how do you know Jim?</p>
<p>SAMI: He&rsquo;s my best friend&rsquo;s dad.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Ah! I see! And who&rsquo;s your best friend?</p>
<p>SAMI: Victoria.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And does Victoria know that you and her dad are, you know&hellip;.</p>
<p>SAMI: Yeah. In fact, she encouraged it.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Really?</p>
<p>SAMI: Yeah, her dad loved when I came over to visit her. And so he asks me to come over on Fridays for some fun.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So, do your parents know you fuck with your friend&rsquo;s dad?</p>
<p>SAMI: No. They assume I&rsquo;m with Victoria.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Aha!</p>
<p>SAMI: Hey, Einstein, I&rsquo;m not wearing anything.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You&rsquo;re butt naked?</p>
<p>SAMI: Yeah, and Jim&rsquo;s naked, too.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Sounds like you two are getting it on. I&rsquo;d better let you two go, so you can have some fun. Say hi to Jim and Victoria for me.</p>
<p>SAMI: I will, Einstein.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Bye, Sami! Boy, that is one lucky son of a bitch! The guy is like late thirties or early forties, and he&rsquo;s nailing a twelve-year-old girl.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Well, you know I&rsquo;d nail a twelve-year-old girl if I could get away with it.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Coming up after the bottom of the hour news, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo; time. Plus more of your calls as &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo; continues.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;3:20&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;. We&rsquo;re taking some calls this hour and having &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo;. Next hour, the writer of <em>Kidsville, USA</em> along with some of the kids from the Florida production of the show will be here. Then in the third hour, our Texas Belles, Donna, Kristine, and Anne Marie will be here.</p>
<p>CHRIS: Will they be naked in the studio?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I&rsquo;m pretty sure they will be. They don&rsquo;t mind being naked in public at all. Call it free entertainment for you guys. Ben in New Jersey, you&rsquo;re on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;.</p>
<p>BEN: Hi, everyone!</p>
<p>DYLAN: Hi, Ben!</p>
<p>BEN: I&rsquo;m going to be in New York next week, and I was wondering if you could recommend some places to visit&hellip;.you know beyond the typical tourist clap trap.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, the place I&rsquo;d recommend after the Statue of Liberty, after the Empire State Building, after Rockefeller Center, and after Times Square would be The Clubhouse. They have some of the best dancers in the area. Even better than some of their adult counterparts.</p>
<p>BEN: Nice.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Most of the dancers will even let you come back and have some one-on-one VIP time with them. When we went there last month with Andrea, she went in very apprehensive. After watching the show and being able to spend quality time with Marley, she thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
<p>VICKI: I seem to recall Marley enjoyed it, too. Even so much as stripping Andrea.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Oh, God! That was a great night. I got to fuck Marley, too. She was awesome for a young girl. How old is she?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Thirteen, she said.</p>
<p>CHRIS: Marley was wonderful. It&rsquo;s amazing how we put all of our dicks in her, plus Dylan&rsquo;s hand and she still survived the night okay.</p>
<p>BEN: So, basically, you can go there and have sex with the dancers.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yes, and it&rsquo;s absolutely encouraged.</p>
<p>BEN: What kinds of dancers do they have.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Practically every kind possible. White chicks, black chicks, latina chicks, Asian chicks. And I think the youngest one is seven. And they go right up to seventeen.</p>
<p>BEN: Nice. I wonder if the seven-year-old can handle a big dick?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Only one way to find out. Go and enjoy yourself.</p>
<p>BEN: I will, Einstein! Thanks for the recommendation.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, no problem, Ben! Thanks for calling. I love going to The Clubhouse. Andrea and I even went last week and had a good time with Emily.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Oh, how old is she?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Ten. So, she had two little bumps. Andrea and I didn&rsquo;t mind. We still had fun eating her pussy, and Emily enjoyed my dynamite.</p>
<p>JAY: Damn!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Lemme take one more call before the break. Chuck in Mississippi, you&rsquo;re on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;.</p>
<p>CHUCK: Hi, Einstein!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Hi, Chuck! What&rsquo;s on your mind?</p>
<p>CHUCK: Well, I was wondering if you all had any thoughts on a nude pageant.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Huh? Actually, I hadn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else had.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Actually, Einstein, that&rsquo;s on my list of things to do.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Now, there&rsquo;s something up. We wouldn&rsquo;t have thought about this because of the time invovled.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: True.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So, I take it that you&rsquo;ve got a plan already.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: And don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;ll be one of the best things we&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Alrighty! I&rsquo;ll believe you. Is that good, Chuck!</p>
<p>CHUCK: Very good, Einstein! I look forward to it.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Thanks for calling, Chuck! I wonder what other surprises are in store for today. If you&rsquo;re looking for the best kiddie porn videos for you and your entire family, look no further than my friends from A Video. We talk here a lot about how our schools are so cash-strapped that we have students wanting to pose nude for athletic programs. Well, our friends at A have a better idea. They went to several schools this year and said &lsquo;Hey, have a Naked Friday! Here&rsquo;s twenty five grand!&rsquo; They filmed school for an entire day and edited out the boring stuff. What does that leave? Plenty! Plenty of sex and lots of skin. And for the ladies out there, plenty of meat. Check out the latest videos from New York, Maine, Texas, Florida, Arizona, California, and Washington. Plus follow students from &ldquo;The Program&rdquo; in Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio, Michigan, and North Dakota. And check out &ldquo;Naked Sports&rdquo; from California, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. I dare you to watch all of them this weekend. That&rsquo;s A Video at Loliwood Stores throughout America. Coming up, it&rsquo;s time for &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo;. Back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo; after this break.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;3:34</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;. Jay&rsquo;s here. Chris is here. Dylan the Resident Lesbian is here. Vicki&rsquo;s here, of course! And Mikey D, who I swear has so many secrets he&rsquo;s not telling me.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: In due time, Einstein. I promise.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Okay. Well, since we had some time this morning, I thought we&rsquo;d take a look at some of the pictures from &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo; on our website at einsteinshow.net. Now, if you want to look along with us, here&rsquo;s how the URL works. It&rsquo;s einsteinshow-dot-net-slash-showandtell-slash-thenumber. Whatever the number is goes after the last slash. I&rsquo;ll tell you the number. Then the crew will give their opinions of the pictures there. If you would like to leave a comment under each submission, we certainly invite you to do so.</p>
<p>DYLAN: I assume I get to join in, too.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Of course! You love girls. Right?</p>
<p>DYLAN: Absolutely.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Then you may certainly tell me what you think. Up first is number 113 from seven-year-old Carmela from Mississippi. Her mother, Dora writes in:</p>
<p><em>Hi, Einstein! Hi, Dylan and the crew!</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a listener for the last year and really enjoy all of the crazy antics. I heard you mention &ldquo;Show an Tell&rdquo; on the air a week or so ago. And I knew my daughter, Carmela, would be perfect. I ran the idea by her, of course. And needless to say, she couldn&rsquo;t wait. You see the first picture with Spongebob on the television. Personally, I think my Carmela is a lot better than Spongebob.</p>
<p>Oh, I agree, Dora. Carmela is fucking cute to start with. Brown hair and brown eyes. And then to have the body she&rsquo;s got standing in her underwear. Jesus, it blows my mind.</p>
<p><em>Of course, it gets better once the panties are gone and Carmela poses stark naked.</em></p>
<p>Oh, my God! You aren&rsquo;t kidding! I love the kitty!</p>
<p>DYLAN: I so wanna lick that kitty!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, it&rsquo;s an awesome kitty. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time you&rsquo;ve licked a seven-year-old anyway.</p>
<p>DYLAN: I&rsquo;ve become a pedo like you.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I&rsquo;d say so.</p>
<p>JAY: I&rsquo;ve been a pedo for years. This show has just let me live out the fantasy as reality.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah, especially after fucking all these <em>Playdate</em> candidates.</p>
<p>JAY: True. And Carmela here&hellip;.did you check out her little ass?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You like the ass?</p>
<p>JAY: Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great ass!</p>
<p><em>Have fun checking out her intimate parts. She was kind enough to let me do close-ups of everything. Thanks, Einstein. I hope everyone like Carmela. Signed, Dora S.</em></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, my God! That is a nice ass.</p>
<p>CHRIS: Sorry, I&rsquo;m love with the kitty. Especially, this picture down here.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Wow, a close-up inside Carmela&rsquo;s little cunt.</p>
<p>DYLAN: That&rsquo;s definitely a lickable cunt. Though I like this one of her asshole.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You&rsquo;d rim it?</p>
<p>DYLAN: Fuck yeah!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, looking at the responses, I&rsquo;d say Carmela is doing pretty well. I think the guys here want more. I know we want more.</p>
<p>VICKI: Speak for yourself. I wanna a brother&rsquo;s piece of meat.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Next we&rsquo;ll go to&hellip;&hellip;.number 143&hellip;.which is nine-year-old Stephani from Colorado. Her mom, Donna, wrote in&hellip;..</p>
<p><em>Hi, Einstein!</em></p>
<p>Remember us? We called in when you had one of the Playdate models in the studio. I mentioned at the time that my nine and six year old wanted to pose for the magazine, and was worried they would try to talk the four-year-old into doing it, too. After the call, I talked with my girls about it, and they thought it would be a good idea to pose for you all. Besides they all love you and the show. So, first up is my nine-year-old daughter, Stephani.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Have I ever mentioned I love redheads? Damn, Donna! If Stephani is like this, I wonder what the other girls are like?</p>
<p>DYLAN: Damn, she&rsquo;s fuckin&rsquo; dreamy, Einstein. Love her tummy.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I love her tummy, too. But check out that fine ass there. Who&rsquo;s this on the phone?</p>
<p>DONNA: Hi, Einstein! It&rsquo;s Donna!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Holy shit! Donna, I hope you know what a knockout you have in Stephani!</p>
<p>DONNA: Oh, I do indeed, Einstein! Thank you!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I just mentioned I love her ass. But I love her tummy and her belly button. Oh, I can&rsquo;t forget about the kitty. It&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>DONNA: Oh, yes it is. Did you scroll down to where my husband put it in there?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Holy shit! He had sex with Stephani?</p>
<p>DONNA: Yes, and they loved it.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: (scrolls down the page and sees a penis inside Stephani&rsquo;s vagina.) Wow! I can see it looks like she took it all in.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah, and my husband does have a big dick.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh my God! Sometimes I look at these girls and wish I could be the one doing it with them.</p>
<p>DONNA: Well, keep hoping. You might find a local girl.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So, if I&rsquo;ve read your note correctly, you got all three daughters to pose?</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah. You want to see Melani&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: She must be the seven-year-old?</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Do you know the number on it?</p>
<p>DONNA: It&rsquo;s the next one up&hellip;.144.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: 144. Very good! And just to explain again, we tell you these numbers so you can find them and look at them with us. And maybe share an opinion or two. (Einstein changes the URL and clicks return.) Another redhead. Very nice, Donna!</p>
<p>DONNA: Thank you. I am a redhead, by the way. That would explain why all three daughters are redheads.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Melani&rsquo;s very pretty, Donna. Very beautiful body. Her ass is as good as Stephani&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah, and she can take a penis in, too.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So Melani did it, too?</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah. One of our neighbors came over and had some fun with me. Then I told him I wanted him to do one of my daughters. And he chose Melani.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: He chose wisely. What a babe! (Einstein looks at Melani&rsquo;s picture with a man&rsquo;s penis up into her vagina.) Damn! It&rsquo;s almost all the way in. I tell you what&hellip;these girls&hellip;Stephani and Melani sure aren&rsquo;t tight at all.</p>
<p>DONNA: No, they get a lot of practice from my husband and his friends.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And then you have a four-year-old?</p>
<p>DONNA: Yep, her name is Destini. Number 145. I knew you were going to ask.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: (changes URL to 145.) Oh&hellip;oh&hellip;ohhhhh! Nice little girl. Wonderful little cherub type body. Love the slit on her. And I like the little ball in her belly button.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah, Timmy loves it, too.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Who&rsquo;s Timmy?</p>
<p>DONNA: He&rsquo;s our neighbor&rsquo;s kid. We let him fuck Destini for the camera.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Man, that Timmy is one lucky guy. I don&rsquo;t know of many guys who fuck four-year-olds. So, you all decided to do this.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah! And then as we went along, we thought we&rsquo;d share with our neighbor and let him come over for a screw or two.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, Donna, you are lucky to have three sexy llittle girls.</p>
<p>DONNA: Thank you, Einstein!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: If you ever plan a trip to New York, let us know. We can help you, and even get you in the studio.</p>
<p>DONNA: Awesome, Einstein! Thank you!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, thank you for calling in! It was a nice surprise! Take care, Donna, and have a great weekend!</p>
<p>DONNA: You too, Einstein! Bye, sweetie!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Bye! She called me sweetie. Let&rsquo;s see here&hellip;.one more before the break&hellip;..how about&hellip;..number 72 from nine-year-old Jennie. Jennie wrote this herself. I guess her parents don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><em>Hi, Einstein!</em></p>
<p>I had heard about your &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo; project and thought that I would contribute. I had my friends, Tara and Emily, take these pictures for me. As you can see by looking through them, I had a very busy day, but I enjoyed doing everything. *wink wink* Well, Tara dared me to take my clothes off in class. I did, and she got many pictures of my naked little body. My teacher saw that I was naked and had me come up in front of the class. She paraded me around so everyone could see and feel everything. I&rsquo;ve never had so many hands touching my belly, my kitty, or my butt in my life. Then she surprised me by picking a boy from the class, and having him come up next to me. And well&hellip;..you can see what happened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna stop there for a minute and see what she&rsquo;s talking about. First off, Jennie is a very lovely girl. Brown hair and blue eyes. And she&rsquo;s got a smokin&rsquo; little body. Very big smile, along with her tight tummy, little slit and little butt. Now I scroll down and see that a boy has a nice hard looking penis out from his jeans. And then Jennie gives the boy a blow job in class. And she&rsquo;s nine years old. Which means she&rsquo;s finishing third grade. So some little third grade boy got a big present from this teacher, having his dick sucked in class.</p>
<p>She contined:</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I got to suck his little cock.</em></p>
<p>How does she know the word &lsquo;cock&rsquo;?</p>
<p><em>But for me, the best part was getting fucked in class by another boy.</em></p>
<p>And that guy really got the prize. Jennie has a little pussy to die for.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget that if you&rsquo;re a girl, under eighteen, you can contribute to &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo;. Just take some nude pictures of you and send them along with a short paragraph or two about them. Maybe what you were doing or feeling. Something like that. Then submit them through the website at einsteinshow.net. We&rsquo;ll post them up for everyone to see your naked self. And, guys, don&rsquo;t forget you can comment and even request pictures from other girls. That&rsquo;s &ldquo;Show and Tell&rdquo;, a great service of einsteinshow.net and &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;! I&rsquo;ve just been told that the <em>Kidsville, USA</em> kids from Florida will be coming in after the break. Why? Must be Mikey D&rsquo;s doing. Be right back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;3:50&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;. I guess Mikey D is playing with the clock a little bit today because the <em>Kidsville, USA</em> kids from Florida are here! Eric Reilly of Lakeland, Florida is the guy who wrote a controversial play that was performed in Winter Haven at Beecher Elementary. <em>Kidsville, USA</em> is controversial because it was performed first for like the first and second graders, then the third through fifth graders, and then the parents at night. And it contains profanity (as if we don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;fuck&rdquo;, &ldquo;shit&rdquo;, and &ldquo;ass&rdquo; here enough), nudity, sex, and some pee. Now, Eric, what was the idea behind writing <em>Kidsville, USA</em></p>
<p>ERIC REILLY: Well, I thought it might be fun to write a sexy play involving kids. Call it the <em>Oh, Calcutta</em> of 2013. So, like the other play, I have the cast come out in robes. They do a silly number, then take the robes off to the shock of the audience.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Now, we have five of the kids here. We have Natalie Jacobs, a ten-year-old fourth grader. Next to her is Devin Braswell, an eleven-year-old fifth grader. Next to Devin is Jasmine Howell, a nine-year-old fourth grader. Then we have Brian Simons, an eight-year-old second grader. And finally, Abby Walsh, a seven-year-old second grader. Welcome to all of you. I guess I&rsquo;ll start with Natalie, since she&rsquo;s closest to me. How in the world did you get involved in the play?</p>
<p>NATALIE JACOBS: Well, they announced in our classes that we were going to do a play. Obviously, this one. But they didn&rsquo;t tell us a whole lot about it. The only way anyone knew how bad or raunchy it was is if they went to auditions.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Obviously, you all went to auditions or you wouldn&rsquo;t be here. What happened at your audition, Natalie?</p>
<p>NATALIE: Well, I read the little sheet that they wanted us to perform. And what got my attention is that my part was all in the nude.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;re not used to that at all.</p>
<p>NATALIE: I can&rsquo;t speak for the other kids. I just know that being naked outside of a shower is very foreign to me. But they had me strip down in front of them.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And I&rsquo;ll bet that was nerve wracking.</p>
<p>NATALIE: Yeah, I mean, who gets naked at school anyway.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, apparently, you all did.</p>
<p>NATALIE: But not at the time.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: No, of course not.</p>
<p>NATALIE: But the judges checked me out in front and in back.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Check out the ass.</p>
<p>NATALIE: Yeah. And then they had me work with a boy who was also naked.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So now, it&rsquo;s really uncomfortable. First, you&rsquo;re naked. Now there&rsquo;s a boy involved and you must have been looking at his dick.</p>
<p>NATALIE: Oh, yes! It was an okay dick. And they loved me, but they didn&rsquo;t like him. So, Devin got that job.</p>
<p>DEVIN: Yep.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And so, how did your scenes work?</p>
<p>DEVIN: Well, me and Natalie portrayed a newlywed couple.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Which, I&rsquo;m guessing means that you two are having sex in the scene.</p>
<p>DEVIN: Fuck, yeah!</p>
<p>NATALIE: Yeah! Did I mention he has a perfect dick?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, does Vicki wanna look at it? Because the rest of us aren&rsquo;t interested.</p>
<p>VICKI: Not really. I mean he&rsquo;s kind of cute for a white guy. But not really my type.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, I tried, Devin.</p>
<p>DEVIN: That&rsquo;s okay, Einstein!</p>
<p>NATALIE: Well, in the scene, we&rsquo;re getting ready for bed. Devin&rsquo;s in the &ldquo;bathroom&rdquo; taking a piss.</p>
<p>DEVIN: Actual piss.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So, the audience got to see it shooting out.</p>
<p>DEVIN: Yep.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Now, Eric, I&rsquo;m curious as to why you included peeing in the play.</p>
<p>ERIC: I wanted to show all aspects. I wanted the audience to see the sex. I wanted the audience to see urination. I don&rsquo;t hide anything just because children are involved. Let&rsquo;s tell them and show them everything. We can&rsquo;t keep them sheltered their whole lives.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: True. So, Natalie and Devin, you two did it on the stage.</p>
<p>NATALIE: (smiling) Yeeeah!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I take it from that response, Natalie, that you loved it.</p>
<p>NATALIE: Yes!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And what was the reaction from the crowd while you two were having sex?</p>
<p>NATALIE: I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention. I had a hard enough time with his his penis being in me.</p>
<p>DEVIN: I could hear some shock from the audience. Like, I didn&rsquo;t pay five or ten bucks to come watch kiddies fuck.</p>
<p>NATALIE: I hadn&rsquo;t told my parents about getting to fuck Devin. They were quite livid at first. Then they calmed down and said well done.</p>
<p>DEVIN: Dad went to see it, and he was very proud of me.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And we got a lot more with Eric Reilly and the Florida elementary cast of <em>Kidstown, USA</em> on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo; after this!</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;3:57&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Like I said a little bit ago, Mikey D is playing with the clock today. Probably wants the last couple of minutes of the show for a big announcement. Find out the big announcement at 5:50. In the meantime, <em>Kidstown, USA</em> is here, plus Texas belles Donna, Kristine, and Anne Marie will be here next hour. Stay tuned for more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo; after this break for your local news.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;4:06&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Hey, kids! What time is it? <em>(sounder: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Einstein time!&rdquo;)</em> That&rsquo;s right! And apparently, today is a big day according to producer Mikey D.</p>
<p>MIKE DANIELS aka MIKEY D: That it is. You&rsquo;ll want to stay tuned for a really big announcement about the show.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: About the show, huh?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Yeah, about the show. Not saying anything else until later.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: But whatever it is, it&rsquo;s big enough to warrant a price increase on Einstein 24/7. The price is going up on Monday. So, if you want to see all the stuff we get to see and be a subscriber, you best do it now before the price goes up. It&rsquo;s $49.95 a year right now, and $6.95 a month. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s going to be after that. Don&rsquo;t take the chance, and sign up now at einsteinshow.net. In the meantime, Vicki&rsquo;s here along with Jay, Chris, and Dylan the Resident Lesbian. And we&rsquo;re back with Eric Reilly, the writer of the play <em>Kidsville, USA</em> as well as several performers from an elementary school where it was done. We talked with Natalie Jacobs and Devin Braswell last hour. We&rsquo;ll be talking with them again soon. But I want to chat with our other actors, Jasmine Howell, Brian Simons, and Abby Walsh. Jasmine just graduated from fourth grade. And I guess you have a summer birthday.</p>
<p>JASMINE HOWELL: August 7th, I&rsquo;ll be ten.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And you got paired up with Brian in the play.</p>
<p>JASMINE: Yep.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And, how did you like being naked in the play.</p>
<p>JASMINE: Like the others, I was very scared. But, as we rehearsed it, it became second nature.</p>
<p>BRIAN: Plus someone like Jasmine can rev my little dick up.</p>
<p>JASMINE: Awww&hellip;you&rsquo;re so sweet.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And were your parents like those that were like &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want this play here&rsquo;?</p>
<p>JASMINE: My mom and dad weren&rsquo;t pleased at all. They screamed at me after we did the last performance.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: What did they scream at you?</p>
<p>JASMINE: Hussy, dick sucker, semen collector.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: That sounds like a badge of honor.</p>
<p>JASMINE: Maybe so, but not at the time.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Did they ever calm down?</p>
<p>JASMINE: The next day. They apologized for the screaming and supported me for doing the play. They just didn&rsquo;t like the fact I was buck naked and having sex on stage. But I loved the sex with Brian. Even got to give him a blow job.</p>
<p>BRIAN: She can sure suck a cock really good, Einstein.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: What did your parents think, Brian?</p>
<p>BRIAN: They seemed to like it. Which I thought was weird.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Did either of you pee on stage?</p>
<p>JASMINE: I did.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You got to do that. Was that odd? I mean the script called for it.</p>
<p>JASMINE: Yeah, it did. And it kind of weird having to stand up and crouch over the toilet so that everyone could see it.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And you probably had to drink enough water to pee on command.</p>
<p>JASMINE: Yeah.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And Devin, too.</p>
<p>DEVIN: Yep!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Down there on the end is Abby Walsh. How are you, Abby?</p>
<p>ABBY WALSH: I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So you&rsquo;re seven years old?</p>
<p>ABBY: Uh-huh!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And you turn eight pretty soon?</p>
<p>ABBY: Next week, I&rsquo;ll be eight!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And how did you get in the play.</p>
<p>ABBY: I try out an&rsquo; see if I&rsquo;m any good.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Did you like taking your clothes off for the judges?</p>
<p>ABBY: No. But it was part of play.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yes, it was. Now they tell me your scene was different.</p>
<p>ABBY: Uh-huh! They had me swing on swingset naked.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Swinging naked?</p>
<p>ABBY: Yep!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah, that would be different and strange.</p>
<p>ABBY: Yeah. Then I walk on stage and wonder where Romeo is.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I can assume Romeo shows up.</p>
<p>ABBY: Uh-huh. An&rsquo; you know wha&rsquo; he does?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>ABBY: Puts fingers up in my peepee. Then he put his peepee in my peepee.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And so, you&rsquo;re also having intercourse on stage.</p>
<p>ABBY: Uh-huh!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Did mommy and daddy not like that?</p>
<p>ABBY: They didn&rsquo;t like it at all.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I can understand. They want Princess to be pure and clean. The problem is, these days, that&rsquo;s very hard to do. We&rsquo;re gonna talk more with Eric Reilly and the kids after Daft Punk.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Get Lucky&rdquo; plays.)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: &ldquo;Gettin&rsquo; Lucky&rdquo; on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;. Well, there&rsquo;s about five of us who think we&rsquo;re gonna get lucky today. I don&rsquo;t know. But I do know that you need to check out <em>Playdate</em> this month. In the July issue, the sun shines on the Sunshine State with &ldquo;The Girls of Florida&rdquo;, porn actress Desiree Gonzalez, and the newest Playdate of the Month, Anna Herbert. And while you&rsquo;re at the newsstand, pick up the new issue of <em>Playdate Pajamas Party</em> and see new pictures of your favorite models like Terri Adams, Angela Bock, Katherine Orozco, Emma Correa, and Emily Minnick. Plus <em>Playdate Casting Calls</em> has the newest girls from Seattle, Chicago, Boston, and Cleveland. That&rsquo;s <em>Playdate</em> magazine available on newsstands everywhere and at the Loliwood Stores throughout America. More with Eric Reilly of <em>Kidsville, USA</em> and the kids after this. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo; and we&rsquo;re coming back.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;4:20&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Back with &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;. Our guests in the studio for a couple more segments are Eric Reilly, writer of a play called <em>Kidsville, USA</em>, and five young kids who performed the play at a Florida elementary school to shocked faces and lots of yelling about the content of the play.</p>
<p>DYLAN: I&rsquo;ve been listening to this and I have no problem with the play. In fact, there was something missing.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Wait! I know! I know! Two little girls kissing and fondling and having sex.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Damn, I&rsquo;m too fucking transparent! You think?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Uhhhh&hellip;..yeah! Anyway, Eric, so you&rsquo;ve got this play. And this school in Florida does the play and the audiences didn&rsquo;t seem to like it, or didn&rsquo;t like the sex, or the nudity, or the language. Did other schools come up to you and inquire about the play?</p>
<p>ERIC: Yeah, we had some in California, especially in southern California, where apparently this is considered normal behavior.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: That is true. There are some parts of California where nude is normal and sex is practiced openly.</p>
<p>ERIC: Yeah, and then we got some questions from a school in Oregon, and another in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And I guess they didn&rsquo;t have a problem with it.</p>
<p>ERIC: Well, we never heard back from the Oklahoma school. If there would be an issue, it would have been Oklahoma. We didn&rsquo;t expect anything from California because, as you said, nudity is normal and sex is out in the open. Even peeing is out in the open a bit.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You know, I keep seeing the girls here, and they&rsquo;re hot as hell. Damn, I got to have one of them.</p>
<p>ERIC: Go ahead.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Natalie, come on over here, sweetie. (Natalie gets up from the couch.)</p>
<p>JAY: Hey, Einstein, as long as we&rsquo;re picking up girls, can I have Abby?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, I&rsquo;m pretty sure she won&rsquo;t mind. Won&rsquo;t you, Abby?</p>
<p>ABBY: Love to.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Hey, Chris, you want Jasmine?</p>
<p>CHRIS: Sure!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Hey, Eric, you might want to get out of the way and let Jay and Chris have the couch.</p>
<p>ERIC: A great idea. At least I get to watch them. (Eric gets up and walks to a hanging microphone.)</p>
<p>DYLAN: I don&rsquo;t suppose I could try them out, too?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, maybe after we get done with them. (Natalie hops in Einstein&rsquo;s lap.) Hey, honey.</p>
<p>NATALIE: Hey, Einstein!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So, I know you got a little dick when you did the show, right?</p>
<p>NATALIE: Yeah.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, I got a big dick you can use.</p>
<p>NATALIE: You do? Can I suck on it?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You can suck on it all you want. Want to see it?</p>
<p>NATALIE: Yes!</p>
<p>JAY: (has removed his clothes and sits next to Abby.) You like, Abby?</p>
<p>ABBY: (feels Jay&rsquo;s naked chest and tummy.) Mmmmmm&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>JAY: Can I see you? (Abby nods. Jay takes off Abby&rsquo;s t-shirt.) God, you&rsquo;re so fucking gorgeous.</p>
<p>ABBY: More?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: (pulls down his jeans and underwear and reveals his six-inch hard dick.) You like my dick?</p>
<p>NATALIE: Oh I love&hellip;..(begins sucking on Einstein&rsquo;s wood.)</p>
<p>CHRIS: (naked with Jasmine sucking on his penis.) Oh, God! She may be&hellip;.the middle girl&hellip;..of the group&hellip;&hellip;but she surely&hellip;&hellip;knows how to blow.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: (with Natalie working on his fuse.) Oh, God! Fuck! Yeah, Natalie! Keep going like that, baby!</p>
<p>JAY: (with Abby doing his pecker.) Oh, Jesus! Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!</p>
<p>DYLAN: Well, since the boys are busy, I&rsquo;ll take over. You don&rsquo;t mind, Einstein?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Nah, go&hellip;..ahead, Dylan.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Well, it&rsquo;s not too crazy in here right now. They&rsquo;re just getting serviced. Abby&rsquo;s only missing a shirt. The other girls aren&rsquo;t showing anything&hellip;&hellip;yet. But I bet that changes. Eric, since I&rsquo;m the only of without a girl at the moment, was it kind of like this during the play?</p>
<p>ERIC: Oh, yeah! The guys were quite pleased with the girls working on their sex bombs. Then they let loose when they stuck them in the girls.</p>
<p>DYLAN: I see! And is that when the parents really got the most upset.</p>
<p>ERIC: Yeah. It was almost a riot during the parents&rsquo; performance. Not so much with the kids, although some were horrified at the boys being in the girls.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Einstein, how is she doing?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Natalie is just great&hellip;..I can feel her tongue on the tip&hellip;..Like she&rsquo;s licking up the liquid.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Fuckin&rsquo; nice! Go get &rsquo;em, Natalie!</p>
<p>(Plenty of moaning can be heard from the three couples.)</p>
<p>DYLAN: Not only does Einstein love it, but I think Jay and Chris do as well.</p>
<p>JAY: Uh-huh!&hellip;.God, Abby&hellip;..is an angel.</p>
<p>CHRIS: Jasmine rocks&hellip;..Oooooh!&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>DYLAN: Einstein is having way&hellip;.too&hellip;much&hellip;fun.</p>
<p>NATALIE: Hey, Einstein. Come put it in.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You bet I will.</p>
<p>(Einstein takes his shirt off and stands naked while removing Natalie&rsquo;s clothes.)</p>
<p>DYLAN: Wow, Einstein! You look marvelous!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Thank you, Dylan. I think it&rsquo;s from working out.</p>
<p>DYLAN: I think Jay is about ready to ravish Abby.</p>
<p>(Jay pulls Abby&rsquo;s jeans and underwear off. Chris takes Jasmine&rsquo;s clothes off. Einstein puts Natalie&rsquo;s clothes aside and inserts his manhood inside her little kitty.)</p>
<p>DYLAN: And there goes Einstein. Man, I never noticed how fit and sexy he was until just now. And his johnson is now safely inside Natalie&hellip;..Looks like Jay is ready to do the same with little Abby.</p>
<p>(Jay&rsquo;s dick enters Abby&rsquo;s lovesack.)</p>
<p>DYLAN: Damn, he got it all the way in there. How long is your dick, Jay?</p>
<p>JAY: Long enough. Can&rsquo;t be that much off from Einstein.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Okay. Just wondering since it went all the way. Chris, how are you coming with Jasmine?</p>
<p>CHRIS: Getting ready to go.</p>
<p>JASMINE: Bring it on, baby!</p>
<p>(Chris sticks it in Jasmine&rsquo;s pussy.)</p>
<p>DYLAN: Well, now we have a full-blown orgy.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Dylan, we got to take a break.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Oh, it&rsquo;s the bottom of the hour already? Back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;&hellip;..maybe Einstein will tell us about the experience&hellip;.after this news break.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;4:34&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Back with more of&hellip;..&ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;&hellip;.Oh my God! That was fucking awesome!</p>
<p>JAY: Yeah!</p>
<p>CHRIS: Woohoo!!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: During the break, I got to fuck Natalie, Jay got to fuck Abby, and Chris fucked Jasmine. I think I&rsquo;m one of the few talk show hosts to actually host naked. Now, Dylan&rsquo;s getting in on this. She&rsquo;s fucking Natalie. The rest of us are watching. Damn, look at her licking up Natalie&rsquo;s kitty. How do like the attention from Dylan, Natalie?</p>
<p>NATALIE: Ooooh, she&rsquo;s great, Einstein! Thank you!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, I just thought of something. Hey, Abby, wanna have fun with me?</p>
<p>ABBY: Can I?! Oh can I?!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Come on over here.</p>
<p>(Einstein gets up from his chair and picks up Abby off the floor. He carries her back over to his work area and puts her on the ground.)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Here you go, Abby. (He pulls on his penis and urges Abby to suck on it. She obliges.)</p>
<p>(In the meantime, Dylan has finished licking Natalie&rsquo;s pussy and starts sucking on her little buds and her belly. Natalie giggles from the touch.)</p>
<p>JAY: Hey, Dylan, move over. How about a double team?</p>
<p>DYLAN: Sure! Come on over!</p>
<p>NATALIE: Oh my God! Two of you.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Yeah, baby! You get his hard stick in your pussy, and me all over the rest of you.</p>
<p>NATALIE: God, you make that sound so wonderful.</p>
<p>DYLAN: It&rsquo;s what I do best, sweetie. Jay, lay down on the floor. Then let her slide on top of your penis.</p>
<p>(Jay lays down. He helps Natalie manouver over his penis. Once lined up, Natalie lowers herself on down, allowing it to enter her sacred throne.)</p>
<p>VICKI: Something tells me I better jump in here. First off, lemme sayy what a circus this is in here. Little Abby is sucking Einstein&rsquo;s dick. Now, we&rsquo;ve got Natalie on top of Jay and&hellip;..</p>
<p>(Dylan frenches Natalie while the little girl continues to go up and down on Jay.)</p>
<p>VICKI: Fuck, this is getting crazy. Like I said, Natalie&rsquo;s on top of Jay. Now Dylan&rsquo;s sucking Natalie&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>CHRIS: Damn! Even Einstein is fuckin&rsquo; naked! When the hell was the last time that happened?</p>
<p>VICKI: Been awhile I think.</p>
<p>(Abby finishes servicing Einstein.)</p>
<p>VICKI: Einstein, how was she?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Marvelous! A great cocksucker.</p>
<p>CHRIS: Any chance I have Abby?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I suppose you could, though the Texas Belles are coming up. I was wondering if you should save it for them.</p>
<p>CHRIS: Sadly, you&rsquo;re right, Einstein.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: We have in the studio Eric Reilly, writer of the play <em>Kidsville, USA</em>, along with some of the kid actors from a Florida elementary school who performed the play butt naked for their classmates and parents. We have little Abby Walsh, Brian Simons, Jasmine Howell, Devin Braswell, and Natalie Jacobs. Hey, Natalie, have you ever thought of being in porn?</p>
<p>NATALIE: You think I could do porn?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: God, the way you sucked my dick?! Fuck, yeah.</p>
<p>NATALIE: I tell you, Einstein. When they said we were coming up here to see you and talk about the play, I secretly hoped you and I would fuck.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Awww&hellip;you did?!</p>
<p>NATALIE: Yeah.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, I&rsquo;m glad you got the chance to fuck me. Our four million listeners thank you. How about you, Jasmine? Would you ever want to do porno flicks?</p>
<p>JASMINE: That has crossed my mind. I&rsquo;m not sure my parents would approve.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Who said they had to approve? Just find another actress and tell you parents that you&rsquo;re going over to their house. Fuck, I think most of the pornos are being done at kids&rsquo; houses instead of a studio.</p>
<p>JASMINE: You do raise a good point.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Abby, I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;d do some porn.</p>
<p>ABBY: Uh-huh. I love when penis inside.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I&rsquo;ll bet you do! I know you&rsquo;re great with cock.</p>
<p>NATALIE: I&rsquo;d love to do porn, Einstein.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, babe, you&rsquo;re perfect for porn. Ride it for all its&rsquo; worth. So, Eric, do you have any plans to write more plays?</p>
<p>ERIC: Oh, I&rsquo;m always running with some ideas in my head for scripts and stuff. I&rsquo;m not sure any of them necessarily lend themselves to a play. But maybe a short film?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oooh! Pornos! I got your actresses right here! Natalie, Jasmine, and Abby! And, God, they&rsquo;re so fuckin&rsquo; sexy hot.</p>
<p>ABBY: Thank you.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You know, they&rsquo;re sitting back down on our couch, butt naked. Devin and Brian are having a little fun feeling their tummies and kitties.</p>
<p>DEVIN BRASWELL: I love feeling them. Their tummies are quite soft.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And I notice you like to stick your finger in their belly buttons.</p>
<p>DEVIN: What can I say? I&rsquo;m that type of guy.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And about half the room is naked. Me, and Chris, and Jay, and the girls. Strangely, Dylan ate pussy without getting naked.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Well, I wanted to eat some pussy. Doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to get naked.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: No.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Well&hellip;..see?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: All right. Well, we want to say thanks to Eric Reilly for dropping in. I&rsquo;m sorry for turning it into a circus.</p>
<p>ERIC: Oh, that&rsquo;s okay, Einstein. Besides, it gave you a chance to fuck with my actresses.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Very true! And we want to thank Natalie Jacobs, Abby Walsh, and Jasmine Howell for coming in.</p>
<p>NATALIE: You&rsquo;re very welcome, Einstein.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And we can hope they all go into porn.</p>
<p>ABBY: Yeah, do porn!</p>
<p>JASMINE: Would love to do it.</p>
<p>NATALIE: I&rsquo;m so there.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And we thank Devin Braswell and Brian Simons for coming and watching the festivities. Too bad you couldn&rsquo;t participate.</p>
<p>BRIAN: Well, that&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s your show. You should be able to fuck &rsquo;em if you want.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Coming up after this break, our Texas Bells, Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie. And don&rsquo;t be surprised if there&rsquo;s even more nudity. This is a great day to get Einstein 24/7. Get a whole year right now for $49.95. You can see past shows, great interviews, lots of skin, and lots of sex with the many girls who&rsquo;ve come into the studio. Now, Mikey D has said that the prices will go up Monday, which I think is July 1. Of course, that&rsquo;s not the only thing. But he&rsquo;s not saying what all is going on yet. But if you want to see all the action live on your computer or i-phone, get Einstein 24/7 today for just $49.95 for a full year of debauchery. And, hey, get it right now during the break and see the Texas Belles fully nude. Einstein 24/7 can be found at einsteinshow.net. Back with the Texas Belles after this on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;4:50&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Back with &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;. We have a naked Einstein, that&rsquo;s me of course. We also have a naked Chris, and a naked Jay. Dylan still has her clothes on.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Well, maybe not for long from the way you talk about the Texas Belles.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Wait &rsquo;til you see them. I forgot we hired you the week after they were here last year. (Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie walk into the studio totally naked while a fanfare plays.) WOW! Look at you, girls!</p>
<p>DYLAN: HO-LY SHIT!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Fuckin&rsquo; nice!</p>
<p>DONNA WHITLEY: Thank you!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: How are you girls doing?</p>
<p>KRISTINE WHITLEY: Great! How are you doing, Einstein?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Awesome! I can&rsquo;t complain. A lot of pussy coming in today.</p>
<p>ANN MARIE ELLIS: I heard that there&rsquo;s supposed to be some big announcement today.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah, Mikey D has been working on something&hellip;..without telling me&hellip;..</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Einstein, I wanted to give you a great surprise. I can&rsquo;t very well do that if I tell you everything.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Next hour, Mikey D. Next hour.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Absolutely, boss. You&rsquo;re just gonna flip over what we&rsquo;ve got for you.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So, I guess I should ask, not so much for us because we know but because some in our audience don&rsquo;t know, how old you are now?</p>
<p>DONNA: I turned 16 in April.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: I just turned 14 this month.</p>
<p>ANN MARIE: And I&rsquo;m 14. I&rsquo;m one of the fools with a fall birthday. I&rsquo;ll be 15 in October.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So, Donna, you&rsquo;re just learning how to drive.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah. Hopefully, I learn how not to kill people on the highways.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Welll, where you live there aren&rsquo;t many highways.</p>
<p>DONNA: That&rsquo;s true. We do live out in the country a bit. We&rsquo;re many miles from a freeway. We live in a pretty small city. You know, we have many of the same stores, and fast food chains that most of the kids in the audience are familiar with.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And one thing, Kristine, that you all do is you go out and get naked in public.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Oh yeah! We love to do that.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Now, I should note that Donna and Kristine are sisters. Ann Marie is Kristine&rsquo;s best friend.</p>
<p>ANN MARIE: That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And so, where do you all go to get naked in public?</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Well, we might go to the local Home Depot.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been naked there several times.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Who normally takes you?</p>
<p>DONNA: Most of the time, it&rsquo;s Dad. But sometimes, Mom will.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I see. And how do you get naked without people seeing you?</p>
<p>DONNA: We try to be careful to have no one see while we flash or get naked. But sometimes we get caught. About half the time, they&rsquo;ll just watch. The other half would just get away.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Well, last week, I went to Safari Sam&rsquo;s with Mom. It&rsquo;s a big grocery store with a lot of stuff in it. And they have animatronic characters who do different things. Anyway, so I posed naked with the animatronic Elvis. While Mom&rsquo;s taking the picture, some boys and their mom come along and see me.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Nice! I should say you have some nice tits now. What size are those.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: They are 36D.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Fuck yeah! So, you&rsquo;re naked and these boys see you.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Obviously, they&rsquo;re surprised by this. Their mom didn&rsquo;t know what to do. I let them pose with me. Then my Mom got the idea to have them take their shirts off.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Could you tell how old they were?</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Kinda young for me. I think one was ten, and the other was seven. Maybe if I were younger, it wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad. Anyway, so Mom took a picture and their mom took a picture on her phone. Then for some reason, their mom decided to have them drop their jeans and underwear. So, I&rsquo;m standing between two naked little boys, though their little dicks looked enticing. In the meantime, one or two shoppers had passed by. They didn&rsquo;t say anything to us. We don&rsquo;t know if they talked to the manager.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Wow!</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Anyway, so the moms got the pictures, and we quickly got dressed.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I&rsquo;m surprised you got away with a lot.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Well, it helps that we have friends who work for the store. They cover for us.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: We&rsquo;ll have more with our Texas Belles coming up. More of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo; coming right up!</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;4:57&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Don&rsquo;t forget that next hour, Mikey D is going to have a really big announcement.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Earth shattering announcement.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Earth shattering?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Okay&hellip;.maybe not earth shattering. But definitely one that you want to stay tuned for.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And our Texas Belles, Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie all return right after the news on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;5:06&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Hey, kids! What time is it? <em>(sounder: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Einstein time!&rdquo;)</em> That&rsquo;s right! And sometime this hour, Mikey D has a big announcement about the show. It&rsquo;s apparently so big it&rsquo;s triggering a price increase on Einstein 24/7. So, if you hurry right now to einsteinshow.net and sign up for Einstein 24/7 for a year, you can lock in a rate of $49.95. I don&rsquo;t know what the new rate is going to be, but I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;ll be a lot more. So don&rsquo;t wait. And besides, if you sign up now and switch over to the live feed, you can see me, and Jay, and Chris all butt naked along with the Texas Belles, Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie. That&rsquo;s Einstein 24/7. Get it now before the price goes up on Monday, July 1st.</p>
<p>LIZA FRANKLIN: (surprises everyone by walking into the studio) Hi, everybody!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Liza&rsquo;s here?!</p>
<p>STACI DYLAN (aka DYLAN): Holy shit! What are you doing here? (Dylan and Liza embrace)</p>
<p>LIZA: Well, I wanted to come visit you. I hope you don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind at all, sweetie. I&rsquo;m just shocked that you&rsquo;re here! (Liza and Dylan kiss.)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And the plot thickens. Anyway, like I said, the Texas Belles are here! Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie. And did I mention they are naked?</p>
<p>LIZA: Fuck yeah!</p>
<p>DYLAN: Woohoo!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, God help us! We have two lesbians here! Anyway, more with the Texas Belles after Demi Lovato.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Give Your Heart A Break&rdquo; plays.)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Demi Lovato on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo; with &ldquo;Give Your Heart A Break&rdquo;. Now, Liza came in right before the song. What in the world is going on with you two?</p>
<p>LIZA: Well, you know we were talking with the ladies over here.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Right.</p>
<p>LIZA: And you know what we look like with no clothes on.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yep! Great looking bodies! And if you haven&rsquo;t seen the pictures from a party they went to about a month ago, you should see them. They were both buck nekkid, as they like to say in Texas.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Yep! And you all are still naked from the last hour.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah, we shagged some little girls right on the air.</p>
<p>DYLAN: We thought&hellip;..why not?</p>
<p>(Dylan and Liza remove their shirts.)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: WOW!!</p>
<p>JAY: Fucking nice!</p>
<p>(Off come their bras.)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Holy shit! Check those tits out! Did we say what size they were?</p>
<p>DYLAN: I&rsquo;m a 36C. Liza is a 36D.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: God, why are you lesbians?</p>
<p>LIZA: Because we love each other, and we love girls like you do, Einstein.</p>
<p>(Next is their shorts.)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh my God! Jay and Chris, are you guys checking this out?</p>
<p>JAY: Fuck yeah!</p>
<p>CHRIS: Hell yeah!</p>
<p>VICKI HUBERT: Man, they&rsquo;re getting down and dirty.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Nah, just naked.</p>
<p>(Finally, the panties come off.)</p>
<p>DYLAN: Ta-daaaaa!!!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, my God! Liza is bald down there. Dylan&rsquo;s got a little hair right above the slit.</p>
<p>LIZA: Here, Einstein, check this out!</p>
<p>(Liza turns around and shakes her ass for Einstein.)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: God, what an ass you have! You sure I can&rsquo;t talk you into&hellip;..</p>
<p>LIZA: No, Einstein.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Hey, Einstein, I got something for ya!</p>
<p>(Dylan turns around and shakes her ass, then pulls her butt cheeks aside to give Einstein a really good look at her ass hole.)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, man! This is really wild. I just saw Dylan&rsquo;s ass hole.</p>
<p>JAY: God, I wish I could lick it.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Jay, now you&rsquo;re really screwed in the head. Anyway, the Texas Belles are here. Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie dropping in today. They come by about once a year and tell stories about being naked in public. Have you all been naked at school.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah, we all have.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Really? &lsquo;Cause I know your school isn&rsquo;t one of those schools where this is allowed.</p>
<p>DONNA: No, but sometimes they look the other way.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I see.</p>
<p>DONNA: Like one day after classes, I went out to the flagpole and stripped while everyone was boarding buses or getting picked up. My friend, Taylor, took the pictures of me.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: No one said anything about you doing that?</p>
<p>DONNA: Nope.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: What about you, Kristine?</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Ann and I do it quite often. This last year, we were classmates in English with Mr. Vincent. He seemed amused when we came in on Fridays and took our shirts off. Then when we started getting more naked, he got happier and happier.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Looking at you three, I&rsquo;d be happy to see you naked.</p>
<p>ANN: Sometimes, Kristine and I would stay after class, and we&rsquo;d have some fun with him. He might fondle our ass, or we&rsquo;d give him a blow job.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Really? Did you do it for a grade?</p>
<p>ANN: He says no. I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I see. We have plenty more with the Texas Belles. Plus you can call us at 1-855 EINSTEIN. That&rsquo;s 1-855-346-7834, and ask a question of the ladies. Back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo; after this.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;5:18&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo; with the Texas Belles, Donna Whitley, Kristine Whitley, and Ann Marie Ellis. Mikey D said during the break that he will make the big announcement after the news break. That&rsquo;s about fifteen minutes away. So stay tuned. He tells me, and I have no reason to question him, that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the biggest announcement in the history of the show. So big it&rsquo;s triggering a price hike on Einstein 24/7. Get it before Monday, and you&rsquo;ll save by not paying whatever the new price is. $49.95 for a year of debauchery and naked fun. We&rsquo;re having some naked fun with the Texas Belles. Of course, they&rsquo;re naked. I am, and Jay, and Chris. Then, in the last segment, Liza joined us. And she and Dylan got naked. So, we seem to have a studio filled with naked people.</p>
<p>VICKI: Wait a second&hellip;.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: (giggles)</p>
<p>VICKI: I just wanted to make sure my clothes were still on&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..Yep! Still on.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Mine aren&rsquo;t going anywhere either.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: No, but the rest of us are. And I know we have some callers that want to talk to the ladies. Chad in Kansas, you&rsquo;re on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo; with the Texas Belles.</p>
<p>CHAD: Hi, ladies! Hi, Einstein!</p>
<p>DONNA, KRISTINE, and ANN: Hi, Chad!</p>
<p>CHAD: Surely, you have friends, guys and girls, that like to get naked with you.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, we could easily spend a whole hour just on that. Too bad, we can only schedule guests for an hour.</p>
<p>DONNA: True! But my boyfriend, Sean, and his sister Sarah, and I are part of a website called &ldquo;Flashing 4 Fun&rdquo;.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Kind of like &ldquo;Show And Tell&rdquo;?</p>
<p>DONNA: In a way. They give us dares, like flash on the road, or flash at the store, or flash on a bridge. There&rsquo;s about a hundred of them. And, so we&rsquo;ll go around looking for the place or the object.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: An object.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah, sometimes it can be a clock, or a ruler, something with a measurement, or a real estate sign.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You mean like out in front of the house?</p>
<p>DONNA: Sure, or a big building. Or maybe even a field. Wherever we can find it, that&rsquo;s where we go.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Then what usually happens?</p>
<p>DONNA: Well, we take turns. One of us will have the camera, and we&rsquo;ll check with clothes on. Once we&rsquo;re sure we&rsquo;re good, then whoever&rsquo;s getting their picture done will quickly strip. We&rsquo;ll line the shot up again, take the picture, then they get dressed fast.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: The easiest way, of course, is to not wear bra and panties. And the guys will already have their shirts off to save time.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah, but like last week, Sean, Sarah, and I went to the mall. And we managed to get some inside the mall shots.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Whoa! Did anyone see you.</p>
<p>DONNA: We don&rsquo;t know. But we found a little area that had no traffic. There was a bench that, I guess, used to face a store. Now, it faces a wall. Sean got the idea to sit down, take his shirt off, then his shorts. He&rsquo;s nice and big there.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I see. But go on.</p>
<p>DONNA: So, I take the pictures while Sarah looks out for us. Then Sean and I change places. He gets my naked pictures, then it&rsquo;s Sarah&rsquo;s turn.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Now, forgive my curiosity. You&rsquo;re sixteen. How old is your boyfriend?</p>
<p>DONNA: He&rsquo;s seventeen.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And how old is the sister, Sarah.</p>
<p>DONNA: She&rsquo;s thirteen.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Awww&hellip;.fuck! She sounds just perfect.</p>
<p>DONNA: Oh, you should see her, Einstein. She is. Brunette, blue eyes, about five-eight.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Holy shit! You&rsquo;re saying she&rsquo;s a tall girl.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yep.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And so, you did these pictures for the website, and you didn&rsquo;t get caught?</p>
<p>DONNA: We were very fortunate to have picked out a really good place to do it.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Kristine, do you have a story or two?</p>
<p>KRISTINE: I&rsquo;m like my sister in that I&rsquo;m also a member of &ldquo;Flashing 4 Fun&rdquo;, as is Ann Marie. Well, I have several more girl friends who flash with us.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Last year, you talked about a girl named Leann and Alyssa, I think her name was.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Ah, yes! Leanna and Alyssa! Yeah, those two have surprised me a lot.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: How so.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Well, here&rsquo;s the thing. During our first flashing trip with them two years ago, they said they went to a Baptist church.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: That is weird. I didn&rsquo;t think holy rollers approved of nudity and whatever else.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: So, we took them to a Jiffy Lube. And after a little coaxing from a customer, they were both naked. It seemed after that they couldn&rsquo;t stop flashing. Next we took them to a McDonalds, where we all got naked with their manager. He got naked with us, too.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: I see. And how many girls were on the trip?</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Six. Me, and Ann, and Leanna, and Alyssa, and Sandra, and Mom.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And you all got to see a dick.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Yeah. And then we got to see another pussy from one of the other employees.</p>
<p>ANN: Yeah, after you pulled her pants down.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: True! Then Leanna asked if we could go someplace to be naked for awhile. Mom took us to a wooded area by our house. We explored some trails naked and even skinny dipped in a pond.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Nice!</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Well, they loved it. They&rsquo;re also a part of the website. Last week, they posted up new pictures of them outside the old school.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Uh-huh. Oh, that&rsquo;s right! You just graduated eighth grade and going to high school now.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Yeeesss!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Very excited, I&rsquo;m sure!</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Yeah.</p>
<p>DONNA: I&rsquo;ve told my friends about Kristine and her little gang of flashers. They can&rsquo;t wait to meet them.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You pretty much have enough for a club.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah, except they&rsquo;re not allowed at our school.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, who needs club status when you have plenty of people already who can spread the word.</p>
<p>ANN: Yep!</p>
<p>KRISTINE: And I&rsquo;ve heard the &ldquo;L&rdquo; word mentioned with their names, too.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Really? I thought you said these were Baptist girls.</p>
<p>ANN: They are. I think they just get so turned on being naked in front of each other that it&rsquo;s gone into other things&hellip;..like sex&hellip;.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: I think it&rsquo;s just an experimentation phase. I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll end up that way. Now, I have another friend, Sandra. And about a year ago, she told me she had a younger half-sister who lives in a clothing-optional city in California.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard of it! It&rsquo;s called Edenton, California. Maybe on a future vacation, Andrea and I will go visit.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: She&rsquo;s gone to see her sister, Dena, in California a couple of times. She&rsquo;ll spend a whole week naked. They&rsquo;ll go to the mall, to the amusement park, various stores around town. She even mentioned going to people&rsquo;s homes and having sex.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Really? Holy shit! Just random people?</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Well, not very random. Only people that Dena knows and trusts.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: But she&rsquo;ll find some guy and he&rsquo;ll bang her.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: She&rsquo;s been known to suck women, too.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Another lesbian,</p>
<p>KRISTINE: No, but there&rsquo;s lots of bisexual women in Edenton, including the little girls like Dena.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Okay, and how old is Dena?</p>
<p>KRISTINE: I believe she&rsquo;s nine years old. She has some friends who are going into the eighth grade now.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: A pretty big group of friends. I&rsquo;ll bet they fuck each other a lot.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: They do.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Anyway, I do have to take a break here. And when we come back, Mikey D is going to tell us the big announcement. I don&rsquo;t even know what the big announcement is. So, I&rsquo;m just as interested as all of you. We&rsquo;ll be back for the announcement and more with the Texas Belles after this bottom of the hour news break. &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo; returns after this.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;5:34&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: We&rsquo;re back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;. We have a pretty full studio crew here. I&rsquo;m here, of course. Jay&rsquo;s here, along with Chris, Dylan, Liza, Vicki, and Mikey D. And we have the Texas Belles with us. They are Donna Whitley, Kristine Whitley, and Ann Marie Ellis. And Mikey D is in the studio because he has a big announcement. My apologies to the Texas Belles. I hope this is worth interrupting their appearance.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: I think this is very well worth the wait. First off, how long have been on the air?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Two years. We started with you, Jay, Vicki, and Chris. We added Dylan last year.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Okay. And what&rsquo;s the one thing I always hear from you about the show.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Besides the fact that you&rsquo;re sometimes lazy?</p>
<p>CREW: (giggles)</p>
<p>MIKEY D: No. Seriously, what&rsquo;s the one thing I hear most about.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, when we have a good segment, we never have enough time.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Right. And I&rsquo;m here to help solve that.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Like you remember when we did that &ldquo;Strip Poker&rdquo; segment?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: And we had to rush it?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Not anymore. I&rsquo;m still planning on two or three guests per show. But the big news&hellip;.ladies and gentlemen is&hellip;&hellip;we&rsquo;re going to four hours!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Four hours?!</p>
<p>MIKEY D: We&rsquo;re going to four hours starting Monday. And now you know why Einstein 24/7 is going up. Because there&rsquo;s going to be even more.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: That&rsquo;s like&hellip;.more fun around here.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: That&rsquo;s right. And the fourth hour will be from 6-7 PM Eastern time. But wait! There&rsquo;s more!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: More?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Yes, we&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of requests from various radio stations across the country to run the show in the mornings.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You&rsquo;re telling me I have to wake up at three in the morning?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Nope! But having a fourth hour made it possible to run the show on delay to the following morning for those stations that want it. What that means, of course, is more stations and more money for us.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: In which case, I want a raise!</p>
<p>MIKEY D: I am happy to report you are getting a raise. We will have this to you before you go, so you can sign it. But you&rsquo;re getting a hundred thousand dollar raise.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: YES!!!</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Which means Einstein will be making $400,000 a year. And he&rsquo;s very well worth it. Everyone else here is getting a one-third raise.</p>
<p>LIZA: Well, except for me.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: That&rsquo;s true, of course, because Liza hasn&rsquo;t been here. She is our newest&hellip;.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Are you kidding?! Liza got hired?!</p>
<p>LIZA: Yes!</p>
<p>(Dylan starts screaming at the good news, and hugs and kisses her girlfriend.)</p>
<p>MIKEY D: She&rsquo;s our newest member of the &ldquo;Bunch of Crazies&rdquo;. And it all becomes official on Monday, July 1.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So what happens on Monday?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Our new morning stations will get a &ldquo;Best Of&rdquo; show that I&rsquo;m gonna put together tomorrow. We will be back here at three o&rsquo;clock on Monday afternoon for a full four hours. Those morning stations will get that show on Tuesday. Oh, by the way. you know that we usually have a song after the top of the hour news. I&rsquo;m happy to say that we will no longer have the newsbreaks. Instead, we&rsquo;ll have music there, and still leave you plenty of time to talk to the guests. And I&rsquo;ve been working on a few minor things related to it, too.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: That is just awesome, Mikey D! As much shit as I throw at you, you deserve a big ups and round of applause from this &ldquo;Bunch of Crazies&rdquo;!</p>
<p>(Recorded applause plays, along with applause from everyone in the studio.)</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Thank you, everyone! I just hope that everything keeps up and we keep going and going.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, we will! Oh, that&rsquo;s just fantastic news! And we&rsquo;re back with the Texas Belles, Donna, Kristine, and Ann Marie.</p>
<p>DONNA: So now that you have another hour, does that give you all time for more sex with the girls?</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah!</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Well, come on, Einstein. What are you waiting for?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Einstein, if I may interrupt.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Why not?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Well, I have an idea.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, you can&rsquo;t do the &ldquo;Pick A Number&rdquo; game since almost all of us are naked.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Don&rsquo;t worry, I know. But we have you&hellip;.and Jay&hellip;.and Chris&hellip;.and Dylan&hellip;.and Liza&hellip;.that&rsquo;s five. And we have three girls. Would you mind having another naked guy in the studio?</p>
<p>DONNA: I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t mind! I think Mikey D looks pretty hot. Get those clothes off! Get that shirt off!</p>
<p>(Mikey D unbuttons his shirt. Donna gets up and unfastens his pants.)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Damn! Donna can&rsquo;t seem to wait.</p>
<p>(Donna pulls Mikey D&rsquo;s underwear off.)</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Nice!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: We now have three girls admiring Mikey D&rsquo;s manhood.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: So, now there&rsquo;s six of us and three of them.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Okay.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: So, do we have a card deck? Standard sized, not &ldquo;Strip Poker&rdquo; sized.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah, I see one right here.</p>
<p>(Einstein hands the deck to Mikey D.)</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Alright. Lemme shuffle.</p>
<p>(Mikey D. shuffles the deck four times.)</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Okay, Einstein, cut the deck.</p>
<p>(Einstein cuts the deck in the middle. Mikey D. restacks the deck.)</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Okay, so here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna do. We&rsquo;re going to play high card. The winner of each play gets to choose Donna, Kristine, or Ann Marie. Each girl can be chosen twice. That&rsquo;s about all the time we have left in this show.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Okay. So let&rsquo;s draw and see who gets the first choice. (Einstein draws&hellip;.) An Ace!</p>
<p>DYLAN: Well, we pretty much know we lost this round. I got an eight.</p>
<p>LIZA: A four for me.</p>
<p>JAY: I got a nine.</p>
<p>CHRIS: Damn, I got a three.</p>
<p>MIKEY D: And I got a seven.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Oh, man! Who should I pick? Last time you were here, I did Donna. So, I think it&rsquo;s Kristine&rsquo;s turn.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: YES!!! I get to fuck Einstein!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Let&rsquo;s finish out the game, then let the fun begin. Dylan, you&rsquo;re first up to draw.</p>
<p>DYLAN: I got another eight.</p>
<p>LIZA: Oooh! A King!</p>
<p>JAY: I got a three.</p>
<p>CHRIS: An Ace!! YES!!</p>
<p>MIKEY D: Man, I got a King and lost!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So, Chris, you&rsquo;ve got the second choice.</p>
<p>CHRIS: Oh, it&rsquo;s a fuckin&rsquo; easy choice. I&rsquo;ll take Donna.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Great choice, Chris. I mentioned I had her last year. Just awesome fucking. You&rsquo;re gonna love fucking her.</p>
<p>DONNA: I can&rsquo;t wait!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Okay, time for another round. Dylan starts again.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Well, damn, it&rsquo;s a seven this time.</p>
<p>LIZA: I got a Jack.</p>
<p>JAY: Yes! An Ace!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Damn, that&rsquo;s three aces so far. And Mikey D. gets&hellip;..</p>
<p>MIKEY D: A Queen. An otherwise decent card that would have won if not for the Ace.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Jay, who do you choose.</p>
<p>JAY: I&rsquo;m with you. I&rsquo;ll take Kristine.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Okay, so Kristine&rsquo;s card is full. No one&rsquo;s taken Ann Marie yet. But I expect that will change.</p>
<p>DYLAN: I surely hope so.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Let&rsquo;s draw and see&hellip;.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Okay, I have an eight&hellip;.again.</p>
<p>LIZA: I&rsquo;ve got a Jack!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Well, our newest resident lesbian might be a winner. Mikey D?</p>
<p>MIKEY D: I got a four.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So Liza wins and gets the next choice.</p>
<p>LIZA: Oh, I&rsquo;m taking Ann Marie, baby.</p>
<p>ANN: Oooh! A girl! Nice! Have I ever mentioned about fucking Kristine.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: You and Kristine have fucked?</p>
<p>KRISTINE: Oh yeah. She&rsquo;s a great pussy muncher.</p>
<p>ANN: Well, Kristine is, too. And I&rsquo;ll bet Liza can top her.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Okay, so we have Mikey D and Dylan left. And Donna and Ann Marie have one slot each left. So, Dylan, let&rsquo;s find out how this is going to end.</p>
<p>DYLAN: I got a Jack!</p>
<p>(drumroll sounder)</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And Mikey D gets&hellip;..</p>
<p>MIKEY D: A Queen!</p>
<p>DYLAN: NOOOOO!!!</p>
<p>MIKEY D: (laughs.) Well, I&rsquo;m gonna make this easy for everyone and take Donna. Dylan and Liza can take on Ann Marie.</p>
<p>DONNA: Yeah! I get to have that pecker!</p>
<p>VICKI: And I get to watch it all.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Yeah, from your cozy little booth.</p>
<p>ANN: Damn, I get two lesbians!</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Not a bad deal, Ann Marie. We&rsquo;re gonna take a break. And when we come back, let the fun begin! Fucking with the Texas Belles after this on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;5:47&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>VICKI: Back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;. Obviously, I&rsquo;m not Einstein. He&rsquo;s about to go to work on Kristine of the Texas Belles. In fact, I&rsquo;m the only not in on this. That&rsquo;s kinda why I&rsquo;m talking. Chris is about to take on Donna, and Liza is already sucking on Ann Marie&rsquo;s tits. And what they told me was that each of the &ldquo;Crazies&rdquo; and Einstein would get five minutes each with their girl.</p>
<p>(Kristine is in a doggy position. Einstein sticks his penis in from behind.)</p>
<p>VICKI: Okay, Einstein fans, he just put it in Kristine. Hopefully, you&rsquo;re watching this online, because you&rsquo;ll see the whole thing. And, it&rsquo;s better to watch than hear anyway.</p>
<p>(Chris lays on Donna, missionary style and inserts his dick.)</p>
<p>VICKI: And now Chris is doing it with Donna. I hear both Einstein and Chris making those sounds you hear in intercourse.</p>
<p>(Liza and Ann Marie moan).</p>
<p>VICKI: I can hear the girls and I look down and there&rsquo;s Liza licking Ann Marie&rsquo;s pussy.</p>
<p>DYLAN: She&rsquo;s doing great, Vicki. By the way, I must say what a nice ass Ann Marie has.</p>
<p>ANN MARIE: Ooooh! Oooooh! Thanks&hellip;&hellip;.Dylan&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>VICKI: Einstein&rsquo;s really pushing it in. Oh my God, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>(Kristine starts moaning loudly. Einstein jams his pecker inside more and more.)</p>
<p>VICKI: Kristine is getting loud. Must mean Einstein&rsquo;s doing great work.</p>
<p>(Donna starts getting louder, too, as Chris really penetrates the sixteen-year-old&rsquo;s love nest.)</p>
<p>VICKI: Damn, Chris! Nice going!</p>
<p>KRISTINE: OOOH! OH SHIT! OH SHIT!</p>
<p>DONNA: FUUUUUCK!!! FUUUUUUCK!! OOOH FUUUCK!!</p>
<p>VICKI: They&rsquo;re rally jammin&rsquo; them in there. You can tell by the loud screams.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: OOOOH!!!</p>
<p>VICKI: I think Kristine just orgasmed.</p>
<p>DONNA: OOOOH!!! Oooooh!! Oooohh!</p>
<p>VICKI: And Donna did, too.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Okay, Jay and I are pulling out. Liza and Dylan switch. Here come Mikey D and Chris. We&rsquo;re going to take a break and be right back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>&ndash;5:56&ndash;</strong></p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Back with more of &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;. Right now, Mikey D is doing Donna, and Chris is inside Kristine. Dylan sucked on Anne Marie&rsquo;s pussy during the break. Now she&rsquo;s flipped her over and licking her asshole.</p>
<p>VICKI: Dylan&rsquo;s pretty wild today.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And time is about up, everyone! How were they?</p>
<p>DONNA: I loved my boys.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Ann Marie, did you like the girls?</p>
<p>ANN MARIE: Oh, yes, Einstein. They were off the charts.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: And my sweet Kristine&hellip;.</p>
<p>KRISTINE: I loved having you inside me, Einstein. Thank you.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So the big announcement is we&rsquo;re going to four hours on Monday, and adding a morning feed for some stations. Plus more music and no more news. More time for guests and fucking. And Liza starts Monday as well.</p>
<p>LIZA: Yes! I get to be with you all and be with my sweet Staci.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: Staci would be Dylan.</p>
<p>DYLAN: Well, it means I get to spend time with my sweetie here.</p>
<p>EINSTEIN: So we will see you Monday from 3-7PM right here on &ldquo;The Einstein Show&rdquo;.</p>
