  "articleBody": "Chapter 1 I was a nerdy teenager. Tall, scrawny, not good at sports. Wore glasses and then contacts. I played in the band–and that was about the only way that I would ever see action on the football field. I had a few friends, none real close, but I knew how to avoid others that I perceived as untrustworthy or potential tormenters. And although I thought about girls all the time, nothing ever appeared on the radar.\nWell, hardly ever. I had a crush a couple of times, but it never went past the junior high, puppy love stage. Just a little hand-holding and hanging around each other’s lockers between classes. Nothing more. And even that was only for a couple of weeks.\nThat’s what made my 10th grade liaison so extraordinary. I knew who Jamie Grant was. I was an observer–I tried to know without being known. She was in the band, played clarinet just like I did and we would often march side-by-side in formation. By the middle of football season, I found that I could actually talk with her and she seemed to enjoy talking with me–or at least she wasn’t repulsed by me or made fun of me. It seemed so natural when we’d just talk.\nOne afternoon, we were making our way back from the practice field to the band room. Everyone else had gone on ahead or were way behind us. Jamie suddenly asked, “What’s your vision?”\nWithout thinking I made tried a funny reply. “Seeing naked girls.”\nJamie stopped, put her hand over her mouth then laughed. “Did you just say that?”\nSuddenly I felt awkward. And a bit embarrassed.. “Yeah, sorry, I was trying to be funny….”\n“That is so funny,” she continued. “I was talking about your eyesight and you suddenly blab on about naked girls.”\nI smiled sheepishly.\nShe stopped and looked at me. “Anyone in particular?” She grinned.\nI really felt on the spot then! Jamie wasn’t the most popular girl, nor was she seen as the prettiest in the school, but she really had a sweet face, lovely honey-colored hair, striking green eyes and a nice curvaceous body that she usually kept moderately hidden under sweaters and jeans. She was nearly the oldest in our class and I was almost the youngest. She was turning 16 in December; I was turning 15 in November.\n“Tits,” I finally said.\n“Whose?”\nI swallowed hard then said, “I think if you were to give me a flash of your breasts, I would probably die of sheer joy and pleasure.”\nNow she turned a bit red. “Really?” she finally said. “Can’t go doing that now, can I? You’d tell and then people would go and talk.”\n“No one would ever believe me even if I did talk.”\nShe laughed then slapped my shoulder. “You certainly have an active imagination!”\nAnd that’s where it stood for another week or two. Our school had a Saturday afternoon football game. It was “away” so the band had to arrive early and catch the bus. I lived quite a ways away from school so walking was out of the question. Nor did I drive. That meant that I would stay around till one of my parents would pick me up. Only that day, they both had some party with Dad’s work that they had to be at that evening. Jamie offered to let me hang out at her house after the game till my parents could pick me up. My parents talked with her parents and everyone agreed that this would be okay.\nIt was a lovely late October day, cool, sunny and brisk as soon as the sun set. Our team won and soon we were back on the bus riding back to school. Jamie sat beside me and whispered in my ear, “My mom and dad are going to be out till much later tonight too.”\nThe thought staggered my mind!\nAnd there in her home was a note saying that her parents would be back with her little brother around 8:30 or so.\n“That gives us at least an hour and a half,” Jamie suddenly said, dropping her band stuff and instrument on the kitchen table. “Go ahead and put your stuff here too.”\nI set my instrument on the table and turned around as she was unbuttoning her band uniform. I stared. She met my gaze and smiled. “I really want to see if you would die of joy or not.”\nMy mouth went pasty and dry. I could barely breath– and I didn’t blink.\nIn a moment her top was off and I was staring at her smooth skin which still held a hint of summer’s tan. But mostly I stared at her white bra. As I continued to stare, Jamie reached behind and unhooked the clasp then shrugged. Her bra sloughed forward and off and I was staring at two lovely orbs. Delicious teen tits, each a little smaller than a half baseball topped with a nipple that was dark pink and crinkly.\n“You’re not dead, yet,” she stated matter-of-factly.\nI decided to play along and slumped to the floor. In a moment she was on top of me, kissing my lips and pretending to give me artificial respiration. Finally I reacted and threw my arms around her, hugging her tightly as I returned her kisses. I could hardly believe that my hand were touching the bare skin of her back.\n“You killed me and brought me back,” I whispered.\n“I want to keep doing that then,” she replied. “Let’s go into the den. And get naked!”\nDidn’t have to ask me twice. We left a trail of band uniforms between the kitchen and the den. She fell backward on the love seat and I collapsed on top of her, thrilling that my naked body was touching her naked body, my crazy engorged, rock-hard dick was drilling into her body somewhere around her thigh or hip.\n“Jeremy,” she whispered, pulling her lips off of mine. “I want to do this right. Okay?”\nI sat back and nodded. I tried to look into her eyes, but kept staring at her tits. They were much smaller than I had imagined them, but still very lovely. Her stomach was smooth and flat, indented only by the navel. I could still see a hint of a tan line above her breasts and across her thighs. She only wore a one piece swim suit during the summer. But now she wore nothing. Nothing! And there her pussy lay hidden behind a light dusting of dark hairs between her legs.\n“I hardly know what to say,” I said once I found my voice.\n“Then don’t. Do you know what to do?”\nI looked at her and then rolled my eyes. “This is a first for me.”\n“Me too. Let’s just experiment. But you can’t put your pecker in my pussy.”\nI must have looked pretty dejected at that statement because she laughed and added, “But we can do everything else. I just don’t want to get pregnant.” She took my hand and pulled me close. “I love feeling your body touching my body.” She kissed me on the lips again. “You don’t know how horny I’ve been since I found out you’d be here and mom and dad wouldn’t!”\nMy dick was twitching excitedly against her thigh. I finally remembered that I had hands of my own and started feeling her tits. Yes, they were small, but they were the largest tits I had ever touched. I was overwhelmed with sensations and raw lust. I had only vaguely imagined that things like this happened, but here I was with a real live naked girl and she was horny as a toad!\n“Lick my tits, Jeremy,” she said hoarsely. I scooted down and began mouthing her tits. Small nipples topped each, but I was fascinated by how smooth her skin was and how hard each nipple felt under my lips and tongue. “Oh, that’s it,” she whispered, grasping my head in her hands. Her fingers rubbed a spot on my scalp as if she was frigging her own clit.\nI knew a little about the female anatomy so I moved one hand down between her legs and rubbed around on her pussy. I was amazed at several things: first how warm it felt; then how little was really there–it was just a patch of fuzz over some soft springy skin. Then! Then I actually slipped into her slit. It was weird! I never imagined how wet and slippery it would be in an excited female’s love crack. I was a little taken aback by all the goo, but she moaned then and spoke gutturally, “Oh, yes!” Her hand felt mine and pinned it in her slit. So I stayed trapped, licking and sucking her tits with one hand in her cookie jar.\nThis went on for several minutes. I was beginning to grow tired. My jaw ached from using it on her nipples so much and my hand was pinned in her slit at an odd angle. Then suddenly she stiffened. With one hand she pressed my head tightly against her breast; with the other she smashed my left hand against her pussy. Her thighs closed in around my hand like vise grips. All the while she made a gasping and moaning sound. I was a little freaked out at first, but her hands kept me in place so I obediently stayed, pressed up against her intimate parts.\nFinally she relaxed and I collapsed against her. We stayed like that for a good five minutes. All the while, my dick was aching because it was so engorged and so pressed up hard against her leg.\n“That was wonderful, Jeremy!” she finally said. “It was like nothing I’ve ever had before.”\nI looked up in her face. She smiled sweetly and I knew I was completely in love. I would do anything for this wonderful girl who just opened up her intimate parts for me to touch. But I needed something now too! I scooted my dick along her leg.\n“You need yours now,” she said, pushing me to one side and then on my back. “You lay there and I’ll fix you up good.”\nI lay back on the love seat, propped up, watching her kneel beside me. She took my spasming dick in her hands and said, “Oh, he’s so cute! I need to give him a kiss!” And then she planted a huge wet kiss on my dick head. I was unprepared for how wonderful that would feel. She proceeded to kiss every square inch of my dick–top and bottom as well as both side–then she started licking it like a lollipop. Starting near the base straight up to the tip. I had masturbated many time before and knew what it felt like just before my jism boiled out, but this was so over the top incredibly wonderful. I was about to explode.\n“I’m about ready to shoot a wad,” I weakly cautioned.\n“Goody,” she replied between licks. And then she licked harder. My dick twitched, my balls drew up into my body, then my jism erupted. I gasped. I had never felt anything like that before. Dang! Even my toes curled in voluntarily. My spunk blasted all over her face and across my chest. Probably four major blasts and several twitches after.\nShe kept holding onto my dick as it slowly deflated, staring intently at it and my jism. Finally she wiped the white spunk from her nose and giggled. “Wow! I didn’t realize that it would go ballistic like that. Oh, sheesh! You have some on your face too!”\nWe were very happy with what we had found and wished that we had a lot more time to explore each other. But given the fact her parents were coming back and my parents would be there not too long afterwards, we were afraid to try anything more that night.\nWe had several opportunities to get each other off like that over the next several months. It was winter which meant cold weather outside, but it’s amazing how warm you can feel when you’re hot for someone. We would take walks down along the creek and she would sit in front of me and I would have my hands in her crotch. She only let me do that if my fingers were warmed up. We reversed it and she had her hands in my pants, but I thought that her cool fingers felt divine against my burning hot dick.\nWe never had sex till March. I had just found out that my dad was transferred and would be moving us to a different state. Jamie and I were heart-broken. I tried to think of all the reasons why I should stay. Then Jamie tried to think of reasons to come with me. It wouldn’t work.\n“Before you go, I want you to come inside me,” she said one March evening. No one else was at her home and would be for another hour. “I want to feel you squirt your joy juice into my pussy,” she whispered. “Make me a woman tonight. Make me *your* woman!”\nI didn’t need to be asked twice. We were both naked in a flash and I was licking and sucking her tits like my life depended on it.\n“No, no,” she said, forcing my head away. “I’m already primed. Just slip on inside and enjoy.”\nShe spread out on her bed and opened her legs wide for me. What a beautiful sight. Her pussy was puffy and pink. That I could see even through the dark strands of pubic hair that lined either side of her labia. Her inner labia were stretched and glistening in their pussy dew. I touched her mound and felt how wet she was. I placed the head of my dick against that lovely slit.\n“Oh, Jamie, you are so beautiful!”\n“Show me how beautiful,” she whispered. “Drive that dick deep inside.”\nI rubbed the head against her labia. She moaned. My dick twitched in glee! I pressed further and watched as the tip disappeared into her slit. “Yes,” she whispered. I felt a resistance. She pulled me closer to her and I pressed even harder. I heard her stifle a cry as my dick plunged most of the way into her pussy’s depths. If having her lips and tongue swirling over my dick was great, this was a thousand times more incredible! I was flooded with so many sensations of joy and pleasure! But I suddenly recalled her cry.\nI held still and asked, “Are you okay?”\n“It’s okay now,” she whispered. “Just hold still while I get used to you being there.”\n“What’s it feel like?”\n“Like nothing I’ve ever experienced. And it’s feeling wonderful know that it’s you inside me now.” She stopped and I saw a tear in her eye. I wiped it away. “I’m okay, it’s just that I’m overwhelmed with happy now. You better start plunging in and out otherwise I’m going to force you to stay in here forever cuz it feels so good!”\nI pounded her for about a minute, maybe a little more, then I blasted several wads into the depths of her pussy as I buried my dick as deep as it would go. She grasped my back side and held me tightly. She wouldn’t let me pull out or roll off till long after my dick shriveled and plopped out on its own. I felt my cum trickle down between our legs.\n“Thank you,” she said at long last. “That was wonderful.”\nSuddenly we heard a car in the driveway. Two bodies scrambled and dressed faster than I thought possible. She even hid the cum stain in her bed. We were somehow both seated in the living room when her mom came in. I stayed for dinner then was driven home. That was the last time that we were intimate with each other.\nMy family moved at the end of March. I wrote Jamie often and got letters from her till about June or July. Then nothing. I was heartbroken. My parents counseled me saying that long distant relationships were hard and nearly always impossible unless the guy had a good job to pay for visiting and phone calls and the like. I knew what they were saying–I just didn’t want to hear it. But nothing I did made Jamie reappear in my life. She was several states away and now she was as good as gone forever.\nChapter 2 So that was my sophomore year. I was a mere callow youth of 15. I went on, mostly got over the loss and the hurt, got a degree in engineering and moved to California. During this time, my mom passed away due to cancer and my Dad became frail and senile. He was in a hospice and fortunately he had set up funds to take care of his situation. The doctor put my mind at ease by assuring me that dad really didn’t recognize me much at all. I could visit but it would be more for me than him.\nAnd since I was an only child, I basically felt like I had no family left at all.\nThen there came a phone call. It was an Saturday afternoon in October–sunny somewhat warm California fall weather. I was 26 almost 27, still unmarried and still very much a social wall-flower: geeky and nerdy.\nI picked the phone up and heard, “Is this Jeremy? Jeremy Atkins?”\n“Yes?” I couldn’t pin whose the voice was yet, but it sounded so familiar.\n“Oh!” and then there was a muffled shriek and a thud like the phone had been dropped.\n“Hello, Hello?” I repeated.\n“I’m sorry, I just fumbled the phone,” the voice said. The voice was warm and inviting, sounding like the voice of a distant October so long before!\n“Who is this?” I asked, suddenly realizing that I knew the answer.\n“I’m so sorry for interrupting you, Jeremy, but I just found out where you lived and I had to catch up.”\nThere was a long pause. I hardly breathed. “Who is this?” I asked again, my voice shaking.\n“I’m Jamie. Jamie Grant.”\nI felt light headed so I sat down on the floor next to the phone.\n“You remember me?” she went on.\n“Yes. Yes, I do,” I finally answered. “I’m just surprised to hear from you. That’s all.”\n“I figured. First, I have to ask. Are you married?”\n“No….”\n“Okay,” I heard a sigh on the other end of the phone. “That will make this a bit easier.”\n“What?”\n“There’s a lot to explain and there’s important things that you need to know. But first I want to apologize for losing touch with you. It wasn’t my fault.”\n“What?”\n“Let me explain. My parents cut us off. I was ready to run away and live with you. But they found out that I was pregnant and they kept me from writing you and even sent me to live with my grandma till after the baby was born.” She paused. I heard her start speaking a couple of times but her voice caught and she stopped. “They even tore up all the letters that you sent me. I tried to write you several times, but they intercepted it and tore it up. And then when I finally did write you, you must have moved!”\n“I’m so sorry, Jamie.” My mind was reeling. The old ache from missing Jamie was now wide open. And there she was on the other end of the phone. And wait! What did she say? “Pregnant?” I asked.\n“Yes. I had a little baby just before Christmas.”\n“A baby?” I repeated.\n“Our baby, Jeremy.” And her voice broke again.\nMy heart caught in my throat. I was overcome with conflicting emotions. “Our baby?” I repeated. “Tell me more.”\n“She had the cutest little button nose, very blue eyes and she had your dark brown hair.”\n“I wish that I had known.”\n“Me too. But she’s not a baby anymore, Jeremy. She’s 10. Almost 11.” There was a long pause. I guess she was waiting for all this new info to sink into my brain. Maybe she was waiting for more signs of how I was taking the news. “And, Jeremy? She needs a daddy.”\nI won’t go into all the details of the reunion and the meeting of my daughter for the first time. But Ginny was the sweetest looking 10 year old that I could imagine. Yes, she had my dark brown hair, but she was Jamie in miniature in every other way. The long and short of it was that I paid for their plane ticket out to California. Jamie said she was next to broke and her mom wasn’t that keen on me being in the picture again.\nI met them in San Francisco. I had taken the rest of the week off. It was a lovely November day right after a rain. The air was crisp and clean and the visibility seemed like you could see forever. Jamie melted into my arms and cried softly. Ginny stood next to her and looked embarrassed or out of place. Jamie looked tired–the previous decade had been rough on her. But she still had that cute smile and sparkling eyes. Her hair was shorter, lightly styled shoulder length but more of a mousey brown than the golden honey that I had remembered. I felt her tits press into my ribs as my hands softly played with the small of her back.\n“It’s so good to see you, Jamie,” I finally said, wiping a tear from her cheek.\nShe sniffed. “I can’t believe it. I’m just an emotional wreck. I can’t believe how happy I am but I am crying. Here, let me introduce you to Ginny.”\nThe young girl extended her hand toward me and I took it and shook it. “Pleased to meet you, Ginny.”\nShe smiled but said nothing. She was a lovely child, and like I said she looked very much like her mom except for darker hair. Her smile would cause her eyes to sparkle. Just like Jamie’s.\nWe drove around and I showed them the sights. Jamie sat as close to me as possible in the bench seat of my little Toyota pickup. Ginny sat next to the door and at first she seemed like she wanted to be as far away from me as possible; but as the afternoon wore on, she did open up and smile more. After lunch I finally heard her speak voluntarily. It was her mother’s voice.\nWe finally made it back to my apartment close to 8 o’clock–but that would have been close to 11 in their time zone. Jamie was very tired. I set them up in my bedroom and grabbed a sheet and blanket for myself on the couch.\n“I don’t think it’s fair to kick you out of your bed,” Jamie began.\nI placed my finger on her lips and said, “You’re in no position to argue. Go get some sleep.” I kissed her forehead and she hugged me in return.\n“You are too sweet. Thank you for everything!”\nI said “Good night,” then turned to finish up some project in the kitchen before turning in myself. It was about a half hour later as I was sitting down on the couch that I heard light footsteps behind me. I turned and saw Ginny standing in the doorway.\n“Hello. Need something?”\nShe shook her head.\n“What’s up?”\nShe was quiet.\nI pointed at a chair across from me and said, “Wanna sit down?”\nShe nodded then made a bee-line straight for the couch and sat right next to me. I really didn’t know how to read her yet, but something in me said to keep it light and non-threatening. “I’m glad to have finally met you, Miss Ginny.”\nShe giggled.\n“Why are you laughing?”\n“No one calls me, Miss Ginny.”\n“I did. It’s an old fashion way of showing respect. Ever see some old movies about people a hundred years ago or more? They always were respectful and spoke courteously to each other.”\n“What movies?”\nI racked my brain trying to think of things that Jamie might have like and let her daughter watch. “I dunno, things like ‘Emma’ or ‘Pride and Prejudice’?”\nShe shook her head. “You’ve seen those? I heard they were girlie movies.”\n“And aren’t you a girl?” I smiled.\nShe laughed again. “Yes, but you aren’t. Why would you watch them?”\n“Because I took a girl to go see them.”\nThe smile disappeared from her face. “I thought mom said you weren’t married.”\n“I’m not.”\n“But you said…”\n“I said I went on a date. Not the same thing.”\n“Oh.” And then she was quiet for a while.\n“Perhaps, I should rent those movies to make sure that you and your mom see them?”\n“Really?”\nI nodded. “Let’s ask your mom tomorrow, okay?”\nShe nodded her head up and down vigorously.\nI smiled at how she was warming up to me. She was taking things in her own time. She sat there and looked around my living room. Not a whole lot–I was a young bachelor and hadn’t decorated beyond basic furniture and TV and stereo. She was wearing a thin night gown and the way it hung I could see that her breasts were beginning to develop–wide, dark areolas were visible, pressing out against the thin white fabric. Her legs had remnants of a lovely summer tan. She was not fat or even chubby, but she had some padding that gave her a definite feminine look.\nShe looked back at me. Her eyebrows were dark and striking. They furrowed across her forehead in a question. “What?”\n“I’m just looking at you,” I said. “I can’t believe that you are my daughter.”\n“Well, it’ll take a little getting used to, won’t it?”\nI nodded. “So why’d you come down here? Couldn’t you sleep?”\nShe shook her head. “It’s the first time I’ve ever been away from home.”\nI nodded. Jamie told me that they lived with her mom– her dad passed away a few years before. Jamie worked as a sales person in a clothing store, but still didn’t have a lot of money. She never hooked up with anyone else, probably for the same reason that I hadn’t yet either. Somewhere deep inside there was the longing for that first love of that few months of our sophomore year.\n“So what do you think?” I asked. “What’s it like being out here in California?”\n“It’s okay,” she said.\n“Just okay?”\n“No, it’s fine. I was just a little scared about coming.” She looked up into my eyes with her lovely blue-green eyes and said, “I really didn’t know what it would be like to meet you. You know, I mean….”\n“I understand.”\n“You do?”\nI nodded. “Of course! It can be a little overwhelming meeting someone for the first time–especially if they’re supposed to be special and all. You never know how it’s going to turn out.”\n“How ‘bout you? Were you a little scare about meeting me?”\n“Scared? No. Seriously wondering who you would be and if you would like me? Yes! But I knew you would be a nice girl because I know your mom.”\n“You know, I have to say….” she paused and twiddled her fingers and looked cute and girly like in an embarrassed sort of cute way. “I gotta say that you are a lot nicer than what I had imagined.”\n“Why’s that?”\n“I’ve never seem Mom so happy.” She looked back up in my face with deep probing eyes. “She’s had a lot of sadness, but you’ve brought her such joy ever since she first called you a couple of weeks ago.”\n“Sadness?” I didn’t really know what I was getting into here.\n“Grandma says it’s all a cuz she had a baby as a teenager. My mom says that was her decision and she is right happy that she had me. Then Grandma says well you’re dirt poor and ain’t never gonna get out of it.”\nGinny was sitting there repeating those words and I heard the anger and frustration that her mom and grandma were suffering. My heart melted. I wanted to do right for Jamie and for Ginny. I wanted to show Mrs. Grant that she was dead wrong.\n“Ginny?” I held my arms out to her. “May I give you a hug? A real good night sort of hug?”\nShe flew into my arms and latched onto me as if she were about never to lose me again! I held her close and stroked her long straight hair. “Your Grandma said you’d never get out of it. But did you ever imagine that you’d fly out to California?”\nShe shook her head against my shoulder.\n“And did you ever imagine that you would ever have a good night hug from your daddy?”\nAgain she shook her head.\n“That means that good things are happening. Your Grandma didn’t see them cause she was too discouraged. We’ll make things happen and then she’ll see.”\n“I like that,” she whispered.\nI just held her close. She had scooted over in such a hurry that her nightgown was caught up on her hips. Oh, sheesh! That was a bare ass down there. Didn’t girls usually wear undies or panties or something? I tried not to think about it, but I didn’t want to attract attention to the fact she was flashing her fanny; nor did I want to spoil her tender moment with me.\n“I like that,” she whispered again.\nI gently rubbed her back, feeling her spine through the thin fabric.\n“I really, really like that,” she said again. “Can I really call you Daddy?”\n“Yes, you may. And may I call you my daughter?”\n“I will love that.” She suddenly sat up and clamored to her knees so that she was a little taller than I was in the seat. She bent over at the waist and hugged me around the neck and planted a big kiss on my cheek. At the same time I was afforded the inviting display of her shapely ass, unhidden and uncovered. Her skin was so smooth; her ass cheeks so full and…. dammit! I just said I was her daddy, not her lover!\n“You’re supposed to kiss me too,” she protested.\nI took her face in my hands and kissed her gently on each cheek. “Good night, my daughter!”\nShe giggled. “Good night, my daddy!”\nAnd then she was up and off, her nightgown flailing back around her properly as she whisked herself away to her bed.\nI turned the light out and finally fell asleep after forcing myself to think of something other than Ginny’s sweet bare rump.\nI woke the next morning to sounds and smells from the kitchen. After my morning rituals I wandered in and found Jamie busy making pancakes and eggs.\n“What a pleasant surprise,” I said. “I thought YOU were the guest!”\n“Sit back and enjoy,” she replied, coming over to give me a playful kiss on the cheek. “You have scored big with both of us women-folk.”\n“Oh?” I laughed and sat down.\n“Ginny told me all about your talk last night. I was a bit worried about her reaction yesterday and how off- put she was on the plane ride out here, but you won her over.” She put the skillet down and looked at me for emphasis. “Daddy!”\n“I hope you don’t think I was too rash.”\n“Rash! Heck no! You’re handling this FAR better than some would have guessed, but you are handling it in the special and sweet manner that I would have expected from you.”\n“Well, then. That means that I scored well with one. How about the other?”\n“Look here mister, I was convinced yesterday that you were everything that I knew you were a dozen years ago when you flew us out here on your own dime. And then you won my daughter over to you in one day? No, mister, you have totally made my day.” She came over and stood next to me with her arms crossed and said in a put on manner, “So how are you going to top that today?”\n“For starters, I was going to see how I could keep you both out here so that I can provide for you both the way I should.”\nJamie’s eyes grew wide, she shrieked and put her hands in front of her mouth then jumped up and down. “Oh Jeremy! Oh! Oh!”\n“Am I rushing things again?” I asked, not believing how happy she was.\n“No!” and she sat on my lap, straddling my legs and grabbed my face in her hands and kissed me hard on the lips. We were locked in that sort of embrace when I heard a cough and a shuffle. Jamie looked up and laughed. “Oh, Ginny, I’m sorry. I’m acting like a teenager again.”\nGinny came a few step closer and said, “I heard the shriek and couldn’t figure out what was happening so I came down and then I saw you two…. I’ll leave now.”\nJamie caught her hand and pulled her closer. “No, it’s totally okay. More than okay. Jeremy just said that….”\nShe looked at me and I finished, “I wanted to see how I could bring you both out here so that I could provide for you both as husband and father in the way I should.”\nGinny looked first at her mom then at me. Tears welled up and she didn’t know who to hug. I pulled her in close and both of them ended up on my lap.\nThat batch of pancakes was a little too well done!\nThere were other things that had to be worked out. And there were things that Jamie had to fill me in on. Things such as how verbally abusive her mother had become, how they had to stay there since there was so little money, and how the doctor had found some lumps in Jamie’s breast–she thought it was okay now. That worried me a little so I made a note to have her go to my doctor as soon as she was my legal dependent. And there was the little problems that Ginny had at school – bullies had been picking on her so she hauled off and decked them.\n“Ginny decked a guy?” I asked.\n“No, she decked the girl; the two guys ran.”\nWe watched “Emma” that night and I winked at Ginny when the gentlemen referred to the young ladies as “Miss.” Ginny giggled infectiously.\nWe got Ginny enrolled in the local elementary school, transferred her grades and re-outfitted both hers and Jamie’s wardrobe with several new items. Ginny was in Hog Heaven as Jamie whispered to me, watching our daughter twirl around and around in her new skirt and tee shirt. I noted that Jamie was incredibly pleased too. The talks with her mom weren’t as stressful as she had imagined it and we settled on a quick wedding with a few friends in a couple of weeks.\nBut Jamie took a turn for the worse. I forced her to visit a doctor and the news was bad.\n“There’s little to be done,” she told us. “The cancer has spread everywhere.” She added after I protested about the lack of insurance coverage, “And it doesn’t matter how much insurance she has now. No known medical procedure could help.”\n“I’m still getting married to you,” I said quietly on the car ride back to the apartment.\n“I’m glad. I knew you would,” she quietly replied, giving my hand a squeeze.\nJamie decided to wait until after the wedding to tell Ginny and others in the family. “I basically have you, Ginny and mom. That’s the only family left.”\n“What about your brother?” I asked.\n“Don’t!” She shook her head. “He got involved in drugs and gangs. He’s doing time for attempted murder and drug possession. I don’t want him to know where Ginny and I are. Ever.”\nSo we got married the weekend before Thanksgiving. Nice little service; nice little honey moon at a bed and breakfast up along the north coast of California. We spent a lot of time staring at the ocean. We also spent a lot of time re-exploring each other’s bodies. Jamie was sick and weak, but she worked hard to make sure that she was up enough to pleasure me and enjoy intimacy. I really think that she wanted to make sure that I had wonderful memories before she slipped away.\nAnd she did slip away. Quickly. Passed away right after Christmas. Ginny took it hard. I was having a hard time too. The love of my life just returned and then ripped away. But I had to be strong for our daughter–during the weeks before Jamie dies and especially afterwards.\nI finally had an emotional release one evening. I didn’t want to. I wanted to keep a strong face for Ginny’s sake. But we were putting some stuff away and Ginny commented about how much that dress reminded her of mom. I couldn’t say anything. I just hugged Ginny and tears started streaming down my cheeks.\nWe stood like that for probably five or ten minutes, then I picked her up and sat down with her on the couch in the living room. She nestled her head into my shoulder and quietly cried. We actually cried ourselves to sleep I think. The next thing I remember was my arm jerking involuntarily and then her heavy breathing next to my cheek.\nI was still sitting, leaning back on the couch and she had straddled my legs with each of her knees on either side of my hips. Yeah, thinking about it now, that meant that her crotch was grinding into my crotch, but at that moment I had no sexual thoughts at all. I really was her daddy and I would do anything to protect her. I tipped us over so that I was lying on my back with her on top of me. I pulled a small throw blanket over her and tried to go back to sleep. Although my mind was suddenly too active for that. I think that I was fidgeting too much and that woke Ginny up.\n“Are you okay, hon?” I asked.\nShe nodded.\n“I think that I needed that,” I went on.\nShe lifted her head and looked at me. “Needed what?”\n“That cry. Thank you for being there with me.”\nShe raised an eyebrow like a question mark.\n“No, seriously. They say that when sad things happen, you half to deal with it and part of it is you gotta have a good cry sometimes. Even guys.”\n“Glad I could help,” she finally said and dropped her head back on my shoulder. Her hands began idling playing with my shirt collar and the hair around my neck. “I’m glad that you were here for me too. I think I may have died if I had to deal with this while still living with grandma.”\nI began stroking her hair. “See? Things do work out.”\n“You mean like I lost a mom but now I have a dad?”\nTears threatened to erupt from my eyes again. “Yes,” I whispered. “And I was given that blessing of knowing just how must your mom always loved me and now I have you here too.”\nShe hugged me tightly and whispered, “We were made for each other, weren’t we?”\n“Yes, my dear daughter.”\n“And I will do whatever it takes to help you ‘cause I know that mom is so special and almost irreplaceable.”\nI held her tightly and stroked her hair and her back. My hands idling moving up and down from her shoulders to her hips. Nothing sexual–really. Just touching. Ginny kept playing with my hair and the stubble of my beard. Maybe a half hour later, we were asleep again. Along about ten o’clock, I picked her up and carried her to her room where we had set up a futon.\nSince she was wearing jeans, I thought it would be best to slip the belt off. But it was too tight. So I unsnapped and unzipped the jeans and pulled them down since her shoes were already off. I looked momentarily at her cute little girlies pink panties and her puffy pussy lips that were outlined in the front. Very cute. Very sweet. Very soft and smooth skin. I shook my head and pulled the covers up and over her, kissed her cheek then went to bed myself.\nChapter 3 So that’s where things stood. Ginny was just 11 when Jamie died. The courts recognized that I was now the legal guardian so my daughter stayed with me. There was one interesting side note to the whole custody thing. Right after Ginny was born, Jamie was still fighting with her parents to let me know and to bring me back into the picture. They refused so she refused to declare who was Ginny’s father. That meant that I was not listed on the birth certificate and was not legally her father by some counts.\n“Maybe in a few years she could replace me,” Jamie said shortly before she died. I figured it was just her mind going out because of the pain meds. But she put her finger on my lips and said, “You know how much she looks like me. There may be a time when she can help you out in all sorts of ways.”\nI didn’t want to even think about where she was going with THAT statement. I was still struggling with the thought of losing Jamie!\nAfter the funeral, I hardly heard from Jamie’s mom. Just as well, since there were bad feelings between her and Ginny. But Ginny slowly came out of her mourning. She remained thoughtful and quiet at times. I checked with her teachers and found that they had no concerns. She was doing very well–even much better than her transfer grades would have predicted. I figured that was due to a more stable home life without the constant natter of her embittered grandmother.\nGinny became especially attached to me during this time. She was a young girl that needed lots of hugs and touching to keep her emotionally healthy. There were some nights–especially right after Jamie died– that she had to sleep with me. I didn’t think anything of it; it was just what a dad was supposed to do for his little girl.\nGinny finished sixth grade (she was the youngest in her class) and looked forward to a summer of lounging by the pool. I had to work, of course, but planned to take some time off here and there to take her hiking, camping and to various places around California.\n“But first, I think I need some new clothes,” she declared. “Especially a new swim suit.”\nI looked her over. Yes, she had grown. Probably a couple of inches taller now than when I first met her the previous October. Her breasts were also swelling out some too. (Warning! Danger! Will Robinson!) I don’t remember seeing any bras in her stuff so that meant that I was going to have to take her girlie shopping. Oh, boy! I hoped that there would be some kind sales lady there who would have pity on me and not think I was a pervert.\nSo one Saturday morning I took a deep breath and went shopping with Ginny. It wasn’t nearly as bad as I had imagined. There was a sales lady who, once she found out I was a single dad, was very helpful. Ginny got a whole new wardrobe: undies, bras (well, training bras), tee shirts, jeans and a swim suit. I still don’t know what I was thinking when I said yes to her buying a bikini–I told her only if she gets a one piece for those more public swim events. (I was imagining boys in her class drooling over her in the bikini.)\nIt was a beautiful day so I decided that we should go to the beach. It was a bit of a drive down to Half Moon Bay, but the weather was perfect. Surprisingly few people were on the beach so I let Ginny use her new bikini. She quickly changed in the restroom and reappeared wearing her flip-flops, bikini bottom and a tee shirt over her top. I already had my swim shorts on. She ran down to the water’s edge and shrieked at how cold it was.\n“It’s not like back east,” I said, joining her in the water after dropping our stuff on a blanket in the dry sand.\nAnother wave rushed up and covered our feet, climbing up our legs. I noticed then that her bikini bottom was pulled tight against her crotch leaving little to the imagination about her pussy. My goodness! Her pussy lips looked large! I felt my dick stirring.\n“The only way to overcome it is just to plunge in,” I said.\nI took my shirt off and put it on the pile of our stuff. Ginny bit her lip then took her tee-shirt off and stood there wearing only the thinnest and skimpiest of cloths. Her tiny tits were invisible–not visible mounds at all. But her nipples were cold and pushed out against the fabric like small marbles.\nWe romped in the ocean waves for a half hour or so. It was infectious laughter that Ginny had. I so enjoyed hearing her laugh and giggle and squeal with delight.\nAfterwards we dried off and I realized that we should have put the sunscreen on first! Oh well, some is better than none! We took turns spreading it on each other’s back and shoulders. Her hands were cold but began warming up as she massaged the lotion into my skin. She had a firm touch. I remembered how she would give Jamie back massages to relieve the tension. Jamie! My mind wandered and I felt a catch in my heart. And now Ginny was here helping me in whatever way. Jamie’s words came back to me: “There may be a time when she can help you out in all sorts of ways.” Well, maybe so.\nAs I rubbed the lotion into Ginny, my hands discovered how delightful it was to touch her skin. As I massaged her shoulders, I looked down over her front and saw that her tits really were growing. They were wide swellings on either side of her nipples which were much more visible when she arched her shoulders back. It was all I could do to keep from lifting her bikini top up and rubbing lotion all over those tiny tits. Putting the lotion on her lower back was also just as dangerous. I wanted to explore lower and lower.\nMy dick had gone out and erected a huge tent. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do about that so I suddenly sat down, plopped a towel on my lap and started getting the sandwiches out to eat.\nWe spent the rest of the afternoon building a sand castle, exploring the beach and climbing on rocks at the far end of the beach. We left about 6. On the drive home, I chastised myself for having sexual thoughts about Ginny. “She was only 11 and a half,” I reminded myself. “But she is beautiful,” another voice whispered back.\nDuring the next few weeks she turned into a bit of a tease. She would think nothing about cavorting around the house in just her panties–she gave the excuse that they were so cute that she wanted to wear them everywhere. Or her thin, short night shirt with nothing at all underneath. I got a lot of peek-a-boos of her ass and swelling tits, but almost nothing of her cunt. I tried to ignore it, but I was beginning to have a permanent hard-on while I was at home.\nSeveral weeks later I took her camping up in the Sierras. Beautiful little spot up off the Stanislaus River – and very few people were in the camp ground either. We set up the three man tent (you know, that means 2 people with a little bit of room for your gear), and then took a long hike.\nWe had a nice campfire that we warmed our food over then played several card games till I was really tired. I had borrowed some pads and an extra old sleeping bag that I brought along with mine. We quickly changed and settled down for the night. Ginny was a bit of a paradox at times. Out in the great outdoors, she was embarrassed about dropping her pants to pee or poop – and she didn’t want me around to accidently see her. But in the tent, she had no hesitation about taking her things off and changing in front of me – even with the flash light on bright.\nShe was cute – her tan had quickly come back after a couple of weeks of swimming nearly every day in the apartment pool. Her tits were delightfully tiny and puffy, topped with dark areolas. I caught my breath as she slipped out of her pants and panties. Her pussy was completely bare – devoid of any hair. Her labia were very puffy and pronounced. It seemed that her slit was much longer and started high up than Jamie’s did.\nI quickly busied myself with changing but decided to keep my dick covered. Although it was doing its best to be noticed.\nI turned the light out and we went to sleep fairly quickly.\nSometime after midnight, Ginny woke me up. “I’m cold.”\nWithout giving it too much thought I told her to climb in with me and place her sleeping bag over us both. She was like an ice cube. And she was shivering. Suddenly I was awake. Her icy fingers clasped onto my arm. I flinched.\n“Ginny! You are like an iceberg! You have to keep your cold hands off my bare skin–at least till they warm up.”\nShe grunted something then wrapped her arms around me and hugged me tightly, trying to suck every ounce of warmth from my body. I coaxed her to turn around and I wrapped my arms around her as we lay side by side, nesting like spoons. I was vaguely aware of how close my dick was to her ass, but I knew that she needed to get warm first.\nAs we were drifting off to sleep, I noticed that she wasn’t shivering anymore. At some point she pulled my hands in tighter around her. My mind flashed in a panic of recognition as I felt her tits through her tee-shirt. But to sleep we both went. I had half memories of feeling her butt grinding against my dick, I also recalled turning over–difficult in a sleeping bag with two–and her hands reaching around me and holding me close to her body.\nI awoke in the morning with her left hand buried under us, lightly cupping my ass. Her other hand was draped over my front, resting on top of a raging hard-on.\n“Good morning, Daddy,” she whispered in my ear once she saw me moving.\n“Morning.” I wasn’t sure what to do. On one hand my hard-on demanded attention and her hand draped there was threatening to start a riot. On the other hand I was embarrassed by the situation and desperately wanted it to just go away.\n“Thank you for keeping me warm last night!”\n“You’re welcome, Ginny.” I breathed deeply and tried to force my pecker down. But I had to pee too. It was piss hard. And her hand rested lightly on top adding to the stimulation. “I think I need to get up and take care of some things,” I finally decided.\nI unzipped the sleeping bag and scooted out. My shorts were tenting grotesquely. Ginny quickly pulled the covers back over her then stared at my crotch.\n“Why’s it all like that?” she asked.\n“What?” I played dumb trying to buy some time as I fumbled with getting a fresh shirt on.\n“Your shorts are sticking out like you have a log in there,” she laughed.\n“Sometimes a guy wakes up in the morning with his dick all hard like this.”\n“Oh,” she paused for a moment then said, “Can I see?”\n“I guess you’re going to have to since I’m changing.” No going back now. I slipped my shorts down and my pecker sprang to attention. I knelt on the sleeping bag, completely naked with my dick twitching and pointing ludicrously toward the sky. I don’t remember the last time it felt so engorged and hard!\n“That’s nothing like I imagined that it would be,” she whispered. “Does it hurt?”\n“No, on the contrary, it feel kinda nice.”\nLights went on in her head and her eyes grew large. “Oh! Is that how it looks when it’s ready for sex?”\nI nodded and slipped a new shirt on. Suddenly I felt her warm hands touching my dick. I groaned.\n“Did that hurt?” she asked, quickly taking her hands away.\n“Not hurt,” I said. “Just surprised.”\nShe immediately put both hands back on my dick which twitched in happy response. “Oh, it’s so warm and soft!” She purred. “But it’s so hard all at the same time.”\n“Well, you’re not supposed to be doing that,” I said, turning my dick away from her, which took every bit of will power I had.\n“Why?”\n“Two reasons. Both would get me in deep legal trouble. First I’m your dad. Second you are a minor–underage– and that would be a felony for me to touch you or have you touch me sexually.”\n“Wow. Is this sex?”\n“Hardly,” I fibbed. “But in the eyes of the law, this is my sex organ and so I would be guilty.”\nI quickly finished putting on new underwear and my jeans then went out to take care of business. And the first thing I had to do was spank the monkey else I would have never been able to pee.\nWe spent the day hiking, and playing in the stream. But night time descended again and threatened to be colder than the night before.\n“I’m not going to freeze tonight,” Ginny said. “I’m curling up with you and we’ll both stay warm.”\nI couldn’t come up with an alternative, so she crawled in next to me and went to sleep. I was a little leery of how Mr. Woody would react, so I started the night facing away from her. Didn’t matter. I woke up in the middle of the night facing the other way, my dick raging hard, embedded in between her legs and one of her legs thrown up over my leg. Dang! I was hot and bothered!\n“Are you awake, Daddy?”\n“Yes. Now. What are you doing?”\n“You turned over and that woke me up.”\n“I’m sorry, honey.”\n“No, no. It’s okay. I then started wondering what it would be like to have sex. I know we aren’t really having sex, but I was just pretending. You pecker was all hard again and it was already rubbing on my privates.”\nMy mind reeled. She was pretending to have sex? With me? Her dad!?\n“Uh, we shouldn’t be doing this.”\n“It’s only pretend, daddy,” she softly said. Her face was right next to mine and I felt her breath on my cheek. “Besides, you’re supposed to tell me about the birds and the bees sometime. Right?”\n“But not this way.”\nI tried to untangle myself from her and turn away but she held onto me tightly. That and how binding the sleeping bag was. I gave up and just held still. She held onto me tightly and her leg wrapped around me even tighter still. That caused her crotch to grind in closer on my dick. It twitch again. She giggled and wiggled her hips back against Mr. Woody.\n“This is dangerous, Ginny,” I whispered, finally holding her tightly in response.\n“Why? Mamma told me how you and she used to have intimate times.” She stopped and giggled. “She said that when she showed you her bobs you nearly died.”\nI started to protest, then laughed instead. I hadn’t thought of that memory in a long time!\n“Mamma also told me how I was made, how you two made love just before you had to move away.”\n“When did she tell you all this?”\n“Oh, bits and pieces here and there. But she made sure that I knew that you two made love and it was an incredible time and that’s how I came to be.”\nI held her close and smelled her hair. Ginny was so much like Jamie in so many ways–especially her directness. She knew what she wanted and she was going to get it.\n“Ginny, this would change everything.”\n“No, it would make it better.”\n“You’re only 11,” I protested.\n“And you were only 15 when you and mom started messing around.”\n“But we were about the same age. That’s a big difference.”\n“It shouldn’t,” she whispered back. “I want you to touch me. I am almost melting on the inside thinking about you touching me.”\n“This ain’t right, Ginny.”\n“And I want to touch you too. I want to give you the sort of pleasure that you’re missing now that Mamma’s gone. She told me how much a man needs a woman. But she didn’t tell me how much a woman would want a man.”\nI was losing my grip on reality. “We can’t have sex, Ginny.”\n“Then don’t have sex. But let’s be intimate and you can touch me and I can touch you.” She reached down between us and freed my rock-hard dick from my shorts then ground her pussy against it.\n“Oh, Ginny. We would be in so much trouble!”\n“No one needs to know.” Then she planted her lips on mine and wouldn’t let me talk. Instead she began sucking on my lips and running her tongue over my lips and teeth. I couldn’t think straight. All I could think of was how incredible it felt. I began to kiss her back. Her tongue snaked into my mouth. My dick jumped and grew in length. I began humping my dick against her leg and pounding it up against her pussy which was still clothed in her shorts.\n“Wait,” she whispered. “I want to be naked and feel you naked with me.”\nDang! She was directing the events just like her mom did some 13 years before. In a few short moments we were completely naked and rubbing our bodies together. My dick ached it was so engorged. I ran my hands over her back and ass, cupping her ass cheeks in both hands as I gyrated my hips forward into her groin.\n“I’m about ready to cum,” I moaned.\n“What?”\nToo late. I spurted gobs of jism into her crotch. I slammed my dick into her groin as tight as it would go and held onto her ass. I know I made a lot of weird grunting-moaning sounds.\nWhen the orgasm finally subsided, I relaxed and melted in her arms.\n“I’m sorry, Ginny.”\nShe put her finger on my lips and said, “Don’t be. That was fun.”\n“But I made a mess all over you and this is something that a dad shouldn’t do.”\n“Is that what you meant by cum?”\n“Yeah, it’s when I release all that sperm and stuff.”\n“You mean that you could have made a baby right then?”\n“If it went up in your pussy and if you were fertile right then.”\n“Oh, wow! I want to see!” She pulled back the sleeping bag and found the flashlight. I blinked at the brightness but laughed at how eager she was to see the white gobs that plastered her legs and pussy. Dang! White gobs all over her bare pussy. She ran a finger through the stuff then sniffed it. “Mamma said that some girls like to taste it.” She licked it and made a face. “That’s weird!” She grabbed her towel and started mopping the mess up. “Did Mamma eat you like that?”\n“We sometimes did eat each other. I don’t know if your mom ever like the taste of cum, but she said that she loved getting me off like that. It made her happy to see me have so much fun.”\n“I think I understand,” she commented, as she mopped the jism from my deflated Willie. “Wait a minute,” her hand stopped on my dick. “You ate her too?”\n“Yes. Boys eat girls and girls eat boys.”\n“Holy moley! You put your mouth right on her….”\n“On her pussy?” I finished. “Yes. And I suppose that your next question is…”\n“Will you eat me?”\n“With pleasure.” I didn’t lie.\nI turned the flashlight out because I didn’t need a light to find her. I grabbed her playfully and started kissing her neck, moving down to her tiny tits. My tongue flicked her nipples and I felt them harden. She gasped and grasped my head, pressing it closer to her chest. I sucked one nipple entirely into my mouth, played with it, then did the same to the other nipple. Back and forth for several minutes. My hands were rubbing her small lumps of breasts and I was getting horny again.\nI decided that doing a 69 would keep her a bit more covered and a bit warmer. It also allowed my dick to dangle in front of her face. Eventually she would feel it and figure out something to do with it. I dove between her legs and found her warmth radiating her aroma up and away. She parted her knees, letting them flop open. I suddenly had unrestricted access to the smoothest pussy with the longest and deepest slit I had ever felt–or licked. And lick it I did. I luxuriated in its smoothness. Her labia were puffy and springy under my lickings and gentle nibblings.\nI felt her squirm and wiggle and gyrate her hips upward toward my eager mouth. About that same time, my dick tickled her nose. Suddenly her hands were all over it, stuffing it into her mouth. Oh Dang! That felt good! I buried my face further into her pussy, sticking my tongue deep into her folds. I felt her little button, hard nubbins, under my tongue. I sucked on her folds and felt her inner labia open up further. My tongue reached a barrier and I felt her jump. Yup! She was a virgin. I promised myself that I would NOT take that tonight. If I played my cards right, I would have that another time.\nShe licked my dick like there was no tomorrow. Her hand were rubbing it up and down and her mouth was sucking on the tip. I was certainly going to have another cumming before long.\nOn one hand I couldn’t believe how quickly I went from “daddy” to “lover”! Of course, she had been teasing me all summer. But now, I caved and I couldn’t stop even if I wanted to. I placed my hands under her ass and cupped each cheek in my hands. As I licked her pussy, I kneaded her butt cheeks, pulling them wider apart. There was so much drool from my mouth and juice from her pussy that her butt crack was slippery. I ran a finger up and down, thrilling at the touch of her anus. I felt it flinch as I touched it the first couple of times then I rested one finger on it and pressed gently. She pushed back against my finger.\nOkay, Ginny, I thought. In we go!\nI pressed my pussy-juice-slickened finger hard against her anus and it just popped in. Almost no resistance at all–all the way up past the second knuckle! At the same time I sucked her clitoris hard and worked the fingers of my other hand around the fleshy folds of her labia. She stiffened and clamped down hard on my dick. Her legs locked around my head and her ass sphincter tightened hard around my finger. At the same time, the jism rose in my balls and erupted from my cock. I distantly hear her moan then sputter as my jism filled her mouth. I suppose it wasn’t fair to fill her that full that quickly, but I couldn’t help myself in that.\nFinally she relaxed and I pulled my finger out of her ass. She rolled me off her and sat up. She opened the tent zipper and spat my spunk outside.\n“I’m sorry, Daddy. I couldn’t swallow that.”\nI pulled her next to me and we snuggled down into the sleeping bag again.\n“I don’t care if you swallow or not, Ginny. You are already doing more than you should.”\n“And I’ll keep doing it, Daddy.”\nWe snuggled in closer, my semi-limp dick cradled in her ass crack and my hands wrapped around her front, lightly playing with her nipples.\n“We can’t tell anyone,” I reminded her.\n“No way! You are mine. All mine! And I want to keep it that way.”\nAnd that’s how my long-lost daughter became my lover. I eventually took her cherry, but that’s another story.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><h5 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#chapter-1">#</a></h5>
<p>I was a nerdy teenager. Tall, scrawny, not good at sports. Wore glasses and then contacts. I played in the band&ndash;and that was about the only way that I would ever see action on the football field. I had a few friends, none real close, but I knew how to avoid others that I perceived as untrustworthy or potential tormenters. And although I thought about girls all the time, nothing ever appeared on the radar.</p>
<p>Well, hardly ever. I had a crush a couple of times, but it never went past the junior high, puppy love stage. Just a little hand-holding and hanging around each other&rsquo;s lockers between classes. Nothing more. And even that was only for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what made my 10th grade liaison so extraordinary. I knew who Jamie Grant was. I was an observer&ndash;I tried to know without being known. She was in the band, played clarinet just like I did and we would often march side-by-side in formation. By the middle of football season, I found that I could actually talk with her and she seemed to enjoy talking with me&ndash;or at least she wasn&rsquo;t repulsed by me or made fun of me. It seemed so natural when we&rsquo;d just talk.</p>
<p>One afternoon, we were making our way back from the practice field to the band room. Everyone else had gone on ahead or were way behind us. Jamie suddenly asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your vision?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without thinking I made tried a funny reply. &ldquo;Seeing naked girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jamie stopped, put her hand over her mouth then laughed. &ldquo;Did you just say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly I felt awkward. And a bit embarrassed.. &ldquo;Yeah, sorry, I was trying to be funny&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so funny,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I was talking about your eyesight and you suddenly blab on about naked girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled sheepishly.</p>
<p>She stopped and looked at me. &ldquo;Anyone in particular?&rdquo; She grinned.</p>
<p>I really felt on the spot then! Jamie wasn&rsquo;t the most popular girl, nor was she seen as the prettiest in the school, but she really had a sweet face, lovely honey-colored hair, striking green eyes and a nice curvaceous body that she usually kept moderately hidden under sweaters and jeans. She was nearly the oldest in our class and I was almost the youngest. She was turning 16 in December; I was turning 15 in November.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tits,&rdquo; I finally said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I swallowed hard then said, &ldquo;I think if you were to give me a flash of your breasts, I would probably die of sheer joy and pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now she turned a bit red. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; she finally said. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t go doing that now, can I? You&rsquo;d tell and then people would go and talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one would ever believe me even if I did talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed then slapped my shoulder. &ldquo;You certainly have an active imagination!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it stood for another week or two. Our school had a Saturday afternoon football game. It was &ldquo;away&rdquo; so the band had to arrive early and catch the bus. I lived quite a ways away from school so walking was out of the question. Nor did I drive. That meant that I would stay around till one of my parents would pick me up. Only that day, they both had some party with Dad&rsquo;s work that they had to be at that evening. Jamie offered to let me hang out at her house after the game till my parents could pick me up. My parents talked with her parents and everyone agreed that this would be okay.</p>
<p>It was a lovely late October day, cool, sunny and brisk as soon as the sun set. Our team won and soon we were back on the bus riding back to school. Jamie sat beside me and whispered in my ear, &ldquo;My mom and dad are going to be out till much later tonight too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought staggered my mind!</p>
<p>And there in her home was a note saying that her parents would be back with her little brother around 8:30 or so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gives us at least an hour and a half,&rdquo; Jamie suddenly said, dropping her band stuff and instrument on the kitchen table. &ldquo;Go ahead and put your stuff here too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I set my instrument on the table and turned around as she was unbuttoning her band uniform. I stared. She met my gaze and smiled. &ldquo;I really want to see if you would die of joy or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mouth went pasty and dry. I could barely breath&ndash; and I didn&rsquo;t blink.</p>
<p>In a moment her top was off and I was staring at her smooth skin which still held a hint of summer&rsquo;s tan. But mostly I stared at her white bra. As I continued to stare, Jamie reached behind and unhooked the clasp then shrugged. Her bra sloughed forward and off and I was staring at two lovely orbs. Delicious teen tits, each a little smaller than a half baseball topped with a nipple that was dark pink and crinkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not dead, yet,&rdquo; she stated matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>I decided to play along and slumped to the floor. In a moment she was on top of me, kissing my lips and pretending to give me artificial respiration. Finally I reacted and threw my arms around her, hugging her tightly as I returned her kisses. I could hardly believe that my hand were touching the bare skin of her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You killed me and brought me back,&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to keep doing that then,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the den. And get naked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t have to ask me twice. We left a trail of band uniforms between the kitchen and the den. She fell backward on the love seat and I collapsed on top of her, thrilling that my naked body was touching her naked body, my crazy engorged, rock-hard dick was drilling into her body somewhere around her thigh or hip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeremy,&rdquo; she whispered, pulling her lips off of mine. &ldquo;I want to do this right. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sat back and nodded. I tried to look into her eyes, but kept staring at her tits. They were much smaller than I had imagined them, but still very lovely. Her stomach was smooth and flat, indented only by the navel. I could still see a hint of a tan line above her breasts and across her thighs. She only wore a one piece swim suit during the summer. But now she wore nothing. Nothing! And there her pussy lay hidden behind a light dusting of dark hairs between her legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know what to say,&rdquo; I said once I found my voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t. Do you know what to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at her and then rolled my eyes. &ldquo;This is a first for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too. Let&rsquo;s just experiment. But you can&rsquo;t put your pecker in my pussy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must have looked pretty dejected at that statement because she laughed and added, &ldquo;But we can do everything else. I just don&rsquo;t want to get pregnant.&rdquo; She took my hand and pulled me close. &ldquo;I love feeling your body touching my body.&rdquo; She kissed me on the lips again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how horny I&rsquo;ve been since I found out you&rsquo;d be here and mom and dad wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dick was twitching excitedly against her thigh. I finally remembered that I had hands of my own and started feeling her tits. Yes, they were small, but they were the largest tits I had ever touched. I was overwhelmed with sensations and raw lust. I had only vaguely imagined that things like this happened, but here I was with a real live naked girl and she was horny as a toad!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lick my tits, Jeremy,&rdquo; she said hoarsely. I scooted down and began mouthing her tits. Small nipples topped each, but I was fascinated by how smooth her skin was and how hard each nipple felt under my lips and tongue. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; she whispered, grasping my head in her hands. Her fingers rubbed a spot on my scalp as if she was frigging her own clit.</p>
<p>I knew a little about the female anatomy so I moved one hand down between her legs and rubbed around on her pussy. I was amazed at several things: first how warm it felt; then how little was really there&ndash;it was just a patch of fuzz over some soft springy skin. Then! Then I actually slipped into her slit. It was weird! I never imagined how wet and slippery it would be in an excited female&rsquo;s love crack. I was a little taken aback by all the goo, but she moaned then and spoke gutturally, &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; Her hand felt mine and pinned it in her slit. So I stayed trapped, licking and sucking her tits with one hand in her cookie jar.</p>
<p>This went on for several minutes. I was beginning to grow tired. My jaw ached from using it on her nipples so much and my hand was pinned in her slit at an odd angle. Then suddenly she stiffened. With one hand she pressed my head tightly against her breast; with the other she smashed my left hand against her pussy. Her thighs closed in around my hand like vise grips. All the while she made a gasping and moaning sound. I was a little freaked out at first, but her hands kept me in place so I obediently stayed, pressed up against her intimate parts.</p>
<p>Finally she relaxed and I collapsed against her. We stayed like that for a good five minutes. All the while, my dick was aching because it was so engorged and so pressed up hard against her leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was wonderful, Jeremy!&rdquo; she finally said. &ldquo;It was like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever had before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked up in her face. She smiled sweetly and I knew I was completely in love. I would do anything for this wonderful girl who just opened up her intimate parts for me to touch. But I needed something now too! I scooted my dick along her leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need yours now,&rdquo; she said, pushing me to one side and then on my back. &ldquo;You lay there and I&rsquo;ll fix you up good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lay back on the love seat, propped up, watching her kneel beside me. She took my spasming dick in her hands and said, &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s so cute! I need to give him a kiss!&rdquo; And then she planted a huge wet kiss on my dick head. I was unprepared for how wonderful that would feel. She proceeded to kiss every square inch of my dick&ndash;top and bottom as well as both side&ndash;then she started licking it like a lollipop. Starting near the base straight up to the tip. I had masturbated many time before and knew what it felt like just before my jism boiled out, but this was so over the top incredibly wonderful. I was about to explode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about ready to shoot a wad,&rdquo; I weakly cautioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goody,&rdquo; she replied between licks. And then she licked harder. My dick twitched, my balls drew up into my body, then my jism erupted. I gasped. I had never felt anything like that before. Dang! Even my toes curled in voluntarily. My spunk blasted all over her face and across my chest. Probably four major blasts and several twitches after.</p>
<p>She kept holding onto my dick as it slowly deflated, staring intently at it and my jism. Finally she wiped the white spunk from her nose and giggled. &ldquo;Wow! I didn&rsquo;t realize that it would go ballistic like that. Oh, sheesh! You have some on your face too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were very happy with what we had found and wished that we had a lot more time to explore each other. But given the fact her parents were coming back and my parents would be there not too long afterwards, we were afraid to try anything more that night.</p>
<p>We had several opportunities to get each other off like that over the next several months. It was winter which meant cold weather outside, but it&rsquo;s amazing how warm you can feel when you&rsquo;re hot for someone. We would take walks down along the creek and she would sit in front of me and I would have my hands in her crotch. She only let me do that if my fingers were warmed up. We reversed it and she had her hands in my pants, but I thought that her cool fingers felt divine against my burning hot dick.</p>
<p>We never had sex till March. I had just found out that my dad was transferred and would be moving us to a different state. Jamie and I were heart-broken. I tried to think of all the reasons why I should stay. Then Jamie tried to think of reasons to come with me. It wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you go, I want you to come inside me,&rdquo; she said one March evening. No one else was at her home and would be for another hour. &ldquo;I want to feel you squirt your joy juice into my pussy,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Make me a woman tonight. Make me *your* woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t need to be asked twice. We were both naked in a flash and I was licking and sucking her tits like my life depended on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said, forcing my head away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m already primed. Just slip on inside and enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spread out on her bed and opened her legs wide for me. What a beautiful sight. Her pussy was puffy and pink. That I could see even through the dark strands of pubic hair that lined either side of her labia. Her inner labia were stretched and glistening in their pussy dew. I touched her mound and felt how wet she was. I placed the head of my dick against that lovely slit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jamie, you are so beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me how beautiful,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Drive that dick deep inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rubbed the head against her labia. She moaned. My dick twitched in glee! I pressed further and watched as the tip disappeared into her slit. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered. I felt a resistance. She pulled me closer to her and I pressed even harder. I heard her stifle a cry as my dick plunged most of the way into her pussy&rsquo;s depths. If having her lips and tongue swirling over my dick was great, this was a thousand times more incredible! I was flooded with so many sensations of joy and pleasure! But I suddenly recalled her cry.</p>
<p>I held still and asked, &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay now,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Just hold still while I get used to you being there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it feel like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever experienced. And it&rsquo;s feeling wonderful know that it&rsquo;s you inside me now.&rdquo; She stopped and I saw a tear in her eye. I wiped it away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay, it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m overwhelmed with happy now. You better start plunging in and out otherwise I&rsquo;m going to force you to stay in here forever cuz it feels so good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pounded her for about a minute, maybe a little more, then I blasted several wads into the depths of her pussy as I buried my dick as deep as it would go. She grasped my back side and held me tightly. She wouldn&rsquo;t let me pull out or roll off till long after my dick shriveled and plopped out on its own. I felt my cum trickle down between our legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said at long last. &ldquo;That was wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly we heard a car in the driveway. Two bodies scrambled and dressed faster than I thought possible. She even hid the cum stain in her bed. We were somehow both seated in the living room when her mom came in. I stayed for dinner then was driven home. That was the last time that we were intimate with each other.</p>
<p>My family moved at the end of March. I wrote Jamie often and got letters from her till about June or July. Then nothing. I was heartbroken. My parents counseled me saying that long distant relationships were hard and nearly always impossible unless the guy had a good job to pay for visiting and phone calls and the like. I knew what they were saying&ndash;I just didn&rsquo;t want to hear it. But nothing I did made Jamie reappear in my life. She was several states away and now she was as good as gone forever.</p>
<h5 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#chapter-2">#</a></h5>
<p>So that was my sophomore year. I was a mere callow youth of 15. I went on, mostly got over the loss and the hurt, got a degree in engineering and moved to California. During this time, my mom passed away due to cancer and my Dad became frail and senile. He was in a hospice and fortunately he had set up funds to take care of his situation. The doctor put my mind at ease by assuring me that dad really didn&rsquo;t recognize me much at all. I could visit but it would be more for me than him.</p>
<p>And since I was an only child, I basically felt like I had no family left at all.</p>
<p>Then there came a phone call. It was an Saturday afternoon in October&ndash;sunny somewhat warm California fall weather. I was 26 almost 27, still unmarried and still very much a social wall-flower: geeky and nerdy.</p>
<p>I picked the phone up and heard, &ldquo;Is this Jeremy? Jeremy Atkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t pin whose the voice was yet, but it sounded so familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and then there was a muffled shriek and a thud like the phone had been dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Hello?&rdquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I just fumbled the phone,&rdquo; the voice said. The voice was warm and inviting, sounding like the voice of a distant October so long before!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; I asked, suddenly realizing that I knew the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry for interrupting you, Jeremy, but I just found out where you lived and I had to catch up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long pause. I hardly breathed. &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; I asked again, my voice shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jamie. Jamie Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt light headed so I sat down on the floor next to the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember me?&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes, I do,&rdquo; I finally answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just surprised to hear from you. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figured. First, I have to ask. Are you married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I heard a sigh on the other end of the phone. &ldquo;That will make this a bit easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot to explain and there&rsquo;s important things that you need to know. But first I want to apologize for losing touch with you. It wasn&rsquo;t my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me explain. My parents cut us off. I was ready to run away and live with you. But they found out that I was pregnant and they kept me from writing you and even sent me to live with my grandma till after the baby was born.&rdquo; She paused. I heard her start speaking a couple of times but her voice caught and she stopped. &ldquo;They even tore up all the letters that you sent me. I tried to write you several times, but they intercepted it and tore it up. And then when I finally did write you, you must have moved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Jamie.&rdquo; My mind was reeling. The old ache from missing Jamie was now wide open. And there she was on the other end of the phone. And wait! What did she say? &ldquo;Pregnant?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I had a little baby just before Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A baby?&rdquo; I repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our baby, Jeremy.&rdquo; And her voice broke again.</p>
<p>My heart caught in my throat. I was overcome with conflicting emotions. &ldquo;Our baby?&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Tell me more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had the cutest little button nose, very blue eyes and she had your dark brown hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that I had known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too. But she&rsquo;s not a baby anymore, Jeremy. She&rsquo;s 10. Almost 11.&rdquo; There was a long pause. I guess she was waiting for all this new info to sink into my brain. Maybe she was waiting for more signs of how I was taking the news. &ldquo;And, Jeremy? She needs a daddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into all the details of the reunion and the meeting of my daughter for the first time. But Ginny was the sweetest looking 10 year old that I could imagine. Yes, she had my dark brown hair, but she was Jamie in miniature in every other way. The long and short of it was that I paid for their plane ticket out to California. Jamie said she was next to broke and her mom wasn&rsquo;t that keen on me being in the picture again.</p>
<p>I met them in San Francisco. I had taken the rest of the week off. It was a lovely November day right after a rain. The air was crisp and clean and the visibility seemed like you could see forever. Jamie melted into my arms and cried softly. Ginny stood next to her and looked embarrassed or out of place. Jamie looked tired&ndash;the previous decade had been rough on her. But she still had that cute smile and sparkling eyes. Her hair was shorter, lightly styled shoulder length but more of a mousey brown than the golden honey that I had remembered. I felt her tits press into my ribs as my hands softly played with the small of her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so good to see you, Jamie,&rdquo; I finally said, wiping a tear from her cheek.</p>
<p>She sniffed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it. I&rsquo;m just an emotional wreck. I can&rsquo;t believe how happy I am but I am crying. Here, let me introduce you to Ginny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl extended her hand toward me and I took it and shook it. &ldquo;Pleased to meet you, Ginny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled but said nothing. She was a lovely child, and like I said she looked very much like her mom except for darker hair. Her smile would cause her eyes to sparkle. Just like Jamie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We drove around and I showed them the sights. Jamie sat as close to me as possible in the bench seat of my little Toyota pickup. Ginny sat next to the door and at first she seemed like she wanted to be as far away from me as possible; but as the afternoon wore on, she did open up and smile more. After lunch I finally heard her speak voluntarily. It was her mother&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>We finally made it back to my apartment close to 8 o&rsquo;clock&ndash;but that would have been close to 11 in their time zone. Jamie was very tired. I set them up in my bedroom and grabbed a sheet and blanket for myself on the couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to kick you out of your bed,&rdquo; Jamie began.</p>
<p>I placed my finger on her lips and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in no position to argue. Go get some sleep.&rdquo; I kissed her forehead and she hugged me in return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too sweet. Thank you for everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; then turned to finish up some project in the kitchen before turning in myself. It was about a half hour later as I was sitting down on the couch that I heard light footsteps behind me. I turned and saw Ginny standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello. Need something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was quiet.</p>
<p>I pointed at a chair across from me and said, &ldquo;Wanna sit down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded then made a bee-line straight for the couch and sat right next to me. I really didn&rsquo;t know how to read her yet, but something in me said to keep it light and non-threatening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have finally met you, Miss Ginny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you laughing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one calls me, Miss Ginny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. It&rsquo;s an old fashion way of showing respect. Ever see some old movies about people a hundred years ago or more? They always were respectful and spoke courteously to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What movies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I racked my brain trying to think of things that Jamie might have like and let her daughter watch. &ldquo;I dunno, things like &lsquo;Emma&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen those? I heard they were girlie movies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And aren&rsquo;t you a girl?&rdquo; I smiled.</p>
<p>She laughed again. &ldquo;Yes, but you aren&rsquo;t. Why would you watch them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I took a girl to go see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile disappeared from her face. &ldquo;I thought mom said you weren&rsquo;t married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I went on a date. Not the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; And then she was quiet for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, I should rent those movies to make sure that you and your mom see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask your mom tomorrow, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head up and down vigorously.</p>
<p>I smiled at how she was warming up to me. She was taking things in her own time. She sat there and looked around my living room. Not a whole lot&ndash;I was a young bachelor and hadn&rsquo;t decorated beyond basic furniture and TV and stereo. She was wearing a thin night gown and the way it hung I could see that her breasts were beginning to develop&ndash;wide, dark areolas were visible, pressing out against the thin white fabric. Her legs had remnants of a lovely summer tan. She was not fat or even chubby, but she had some padding that gave her a definite feminine look.</p>
<p>She looked back at me. Her eyebrows were dark and striking. They furrowed across her forehead in a question. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just looking at you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that you are my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;ll take a little getting used to, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;So why&rsquo;d you come down here? Couldn&rsquo;t you sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever been away from home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. Jamie told me that they lived with her mom&ndash; her dad passed away a few years before. Jamie worked as a sales person in a clothing store, but still didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money. She never hooked up with anyone else, probably for the same reason that I hadn&rsquo;t yet either. Somewhere deep inside there was the longing for that first love of that few months of our sophomore year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what do you think?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it like being out here in California?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine. I was just a little scared about coming.&rdquo; She looked up into my eyes with her lovely blue-green eyes and said, &ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t know what it would be like to meet you. You know, I mean&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;Of course! It can be a little overwhelming meeting someone for the first time&ndash;especially if they&rsquo;re supposed to be special and all. You never know how it&rsquo;s going to turn out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How &lsquo;bout you? Were you a little scare about meeting me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scared? No. Seriously wondering who you would be and if you would like me? Yes! But I knew you would be a nice girl because I know your mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I have to say&hellip;.&rdquo; she paused and twiddled her fingers and looked cute and girly like in an embarrassed sort of cute way. &ldquo;I gotta say that you are a lot nicer than what I had imagined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seem Mom so happy.&rdquo; She looked back up in my face with deep probing eyes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s had a lot of sadness, but you&rsquo;ve brought her such joy ever since she first called you a couple of weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadness?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was getting into here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandma says it&rsquo;s all a cuz she had a baby as a teenager. My mom says that was her decision and she is right happy that she had me. Then Grandma says well you&rsquo;re dirt poor and ain&rsquo;t never gonna get out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ginny was sitting there repeating those words and I heard the anger and frustration that her mom and grandma were suffering. My heart melted. I wanted to do right for Jamie and for Ginny. I wanted to show Mrs. Grant that she was dead wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ginny?&rdquo; I held my arms out to her. &ldquo;May I give you a hug? A real good night sort of hug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flew into my arms and latched onto me as if she were about never to lose me again! I held her close and stroked her long straight hair. &ldquo;Your Grandma said you&rsquo;d never get out of it. But did you ever imagine that you&rsquo;d fly out to California?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head against my shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you ever imagine that you would ever have a good night hug from your daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means that good things are happening. Your Grandma didn&rsquo;t see them cause she was too discouraged. We&rsquo;ll make things happen and then she&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>I just held her close. She had scooted over in such a hurry that her nightgown was caught up on her hips. Oh, sheesh! That was a bare ass down there. Didn&rsquo;t girls usually wear undies or panties or something? I tried not to think about it, but I didn&rsquo;t want to attract attention to the fact she was flashing her fanny; nor did I want to spoil her tender moment with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; she whispered again.</p>
<p>I gently rubbed her back, feeling her spine through the thin fabric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really, really like that,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;Can I really call you Daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you may. And may I call you my daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will love that.&rdquo; She suddenly sat up and clamored to her knees so that she was a little taller than I was in the seat. She bent over at the waist and hugged me around the neck and planted a big kiss on my cheek. At the same time I was afforded the inviting display of her shapely ass, unhidden and uncovered. Her skin was so smooth; her ass cheeks so full and&hellip;. dammit! I just said I was her daddy, not her lover!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to kiss me too,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>I took her face in my hands and kissed her gently on each cheek. &ldquo;Good night, my daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She giggled. &ldquo;Good night, my daddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she was up and off, her nightgown flailing back around her properly as she whisked herself away to her bed.</p>
<p>I turned the light out and finally fell asleep after forcing myself to think of something other than Ginny&rsquo;s sweet bare rump.</p>
<p>I woke the next morning to sounds and smells from the kitchen. After my morning rituals I wandered in and found Jamie busy making pancakes and eggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pleasant surprise,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I thought YOU were the guest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit back and enjoy,&rdquo; she replied, coming over to give me a playful kiss on the cheek. &ldquo;You have scored big with both of us women-folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; I laughed and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ginny told me all about your talk last night. I was a bit worried about her reaction yesterday and how off- put she was on the plane ride out here, but you won her over.&rdquo; She put the skillet down and looked at me for emphasis. &ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think I was too rash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rash! Heck no! You&rsquo;re handling this FAR better than some would have guessed, but you are handling it in the special and sweet manner that I would have expected from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then. That means that I scored well with one. How about the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here mister, I was convinced yesterday that you were everything that I knew you were a dozen years ago when you flew us out here on your own dime. And then you won my daughter over to you in one day? No, mister, you have totally made my day.&rdquo; She came over and stood next to me with her arms crossed and said in a put on manner, &ldquo;So how are you going to top that today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For starters, I was going to see how I could keep you both out here so that I can provide for you both the way I should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jamie&rsquo;s eyes grew wide, she shrieked and put her hands in front of her mouth then jumped up and down. &ldquo;Oh Jeremy! Oh! Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I rushing things again?&rdquo; I asked, not believing how happy she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; and she sat on my lap, straddling my legs and grabbed my face in her hands and kissed me hard on the lips. We were locked in that sort of embrace when I heard a cough and a shuffle. Jamie looked up and laughed. &ldquo;Oh, Ginny, I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m acting like a teenager again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ginny came a few step closer and said, &ldquo;I heard the shriek and couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was happening so I came down and then I saw you two&hellip;. I&rsquo;ll leave now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jamie caught her hand and pulled her closer. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s totally okay. More than okay. Jeremy just said that&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me and I finished, &ldquo;I wanted to see how I could bring you both out here so that I could provide for you both as husband and father in the way I should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ginny looked first at her mom then at me. Tears welled up and she didn&rsquo;t know who to hug. I pulled her in close and both of them ended up on my lap.</p>
<p>That batch of pancakes was a little too well done!</p>
<p>There were other things that had to be worked out. And there were things that Jamie had to fill me in on. Things such as how verbally abusive her mother had become, how they had to stay there since there was so little money, and how the doctor had found some lumps in Jamie&rsquo;s breast&ndash;she thought it was okay now. That worried me a little so I made a note to have her go to my doctor as soon as she was my legal dependent. And there was the little problems that Ginny had at school &ndash; bullies had been picking on her so she hauled off and decked them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ginny decked a guy?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she decked the girl; the two guys ran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We watched &ldquo;Emma&rdquo; that night and I winked at Ginny when the gentlemen referred to the young ladies as &ldquo;Miss.&rdquo; Ginny giggled infectiously.</p>
<p>We got Ginny enrolled in the local elementary school, transferred her grades and re-outfitted both hers and Jamie&rsquo;s wardrobe with several new items. Ginny was in Hog Heaven as Jamie whispered to me, watching our daughter twirl around and around in her new skirt and tee shirt. I noted that Jamie was incredibly pleased too. The talks with her mom weren&rsquo;t as stressful as she had imagined it and we settled on a quick wedding with a few friends in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>But Jamie took a turn for the worse. I forced her to visit a doctor and the news was bad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s little to be done,&rdquo; she told us. &ldquo;The cancer has spread everywhere.&rdquo; She added after I protested about the lack of insurance coverage, &ldquo;And it doesn&rsquo;t matter how much insurance she has now. No known medical procedure could help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still getting married to you,&rdquo; I said quietly on the car ride back to the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad. I knew you would,&rdquo; she quietly replied, giving my hand a squeeze.</p>
<p>Jamie decided to wait until after the wedding to tell Ginny and others in the family. &ldquo;I basically have you, Ginny and mom. That&rsquo;s the only family left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about your brother?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;He got involved in drugs and gangs. He&rsquo;s doing time for attempted murder and drug possession. I don&rsquo;t want him to know where Ginny and I are. Ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we got married the weekend before Thanksgiving. Nice little service; nice little honey moon at a bed and breakfast up along the north coast of California. We spent a lot of time staring at the ocean. We also spent a lot of time re-exploring each other&rsquo;s bodies. Jamie was sick and weak, but she worked hard to make sure that she was up enough to pleasure me and enjoy intimacy. I really think that she wanted to make sure that I had wonderful memories before she slipped away.</p>
<p>And she did slip away. Quickly. Passed away right after Christmas. Ginny took it hard. I was having a hard time too. The love of my life just returned and then ripped away. But I had to be strong for our daughter&ndash;during the weeks before Jamie dies and especially afterwards.</p>
<p>I finally had an emotional release one evening. I didn&rsquo;t want to. I wanted to keep a strong face for Ginny&rsquo;s sake. But we were putting some stuff away and Ginny commented about how much that dress reminded her of mom. I couldn&rsquo;t say anything. I just hugged Ginny and tears started streaming down my cheeks.</p>
<p>We stood like that for probably five or ten minutes, then I picked her up and sat down with her on the couch in the living room. She nestled her head into my shoulder and quietly cried. We actually cried ourselves to sleep I think. The next thing I remember was my arm jerking involuntarily and then her heavy breathing next to my cheek.</p>
<p>I was still sitting, leaning back on the couch and she had straddled my legs with each of her knees on either side of my hips. Yeah, thinking about it now, that meant that her crotch was grinding into my crotch, but at that moment I had no sexual thoughts at all. I really was her daddy and I would do anything to protect her. I tipped us over so that I was lying on my back with her on top of me. I pulled a small throw blanket over her and tried to go back to sleep. Although my mind was suddenly too active for that. I think that I was fidgeting too much and that woke Ginny up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you okay, hon?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that I needed that,&rdquo; I went on.</p>
<p>She lifted her head and looked at me. &ldquo;Needed what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cry. Thank you for being there with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow like a question mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, seriously. They say that when sad things happen, you half to deal with it and part of it is you gotta have a good cry sometimes. Even guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad I could help,&rdquo; she finally said and dropped her head back on my shoulder. Her hands began idling playing with my shirt collar and the hair around my neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that you were here for me too. I think I may have died if I had to deal with this while still living with grandma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began stroking her hair. &ldquo;See? Things do work out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean like I lost a mom but now I have a dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears threatened to erupt from my eyes again. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;And I was given that blessing of knowing just how must your mom always loved me and now I have you here too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hugged me tightly and whispered, &ldquo;We were made for each other, weren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will do whatever it takes to help you &lsquo;cause I know that mom is so special and almost irreplaceable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I held her tightly and stroked her hair and her back. My hands idling moving up and down from her shoulders to her hips. Nothing sexual&ndash;really. Just touching. Ginny kept playing with my hair and the stubble of my beard. Maybe a half hour later, we were asleep again. Along about ten o&rsquo;clock, I picked her up and carried her to her room where we had set up a futon.</p>
<p>Since she was wearing jeans, I thought it would be best to slip the belt off. But it was too tight. So I unsnapped and unzipped the jeans and pulled them down since her shoes were already off. I looked momentarily at her cute little girlies pink panties and her puffy pussy lips that were outlined in the front. Very cute. Very sweet. Very soft and smooth skin. I shook my head and pulled the covers up and over her, kissed her cheek then went to bed myself.</p>
<h5 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#chapter-3">#</a></h5>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where things stood. Ginny was just 11 when Jamie died. The courts recognized that I was now the legal guardian so my daughter stayed with me. There was one interesting side note to the whole custody thing. Right after Ginny was born, Jamie was still fighting with her parents to let me know and to bring me back into the picture. They refused so she refused to declare who was Ginny&rsquo;s father. That meant that I was not listed on the birth certificate and was not legally her father by some counts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe in a few years she could replace me,&rdquo; Jamie said shortly before she died. I figured it was just her mind going out because of the pain meds. But she put her finger on my lips and said, &ldquo;You know how much she looks like me. There may be a time when she can help you out in all sorts of ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to even think about where she was going with THAT statement. I was still struggling with the thought of losing Jamie!</p>
<p>After the funeral, I hardly heard from Jamie&rsquo;s mom. Just as well, since there were bad feelings between her and Ginny. But Ginny slowly came out of her mourning. She remained thoughtful and quiet at times. I checked with her teachers and found that they had no concerns. She was doing very well&ndash;even much better than her transfer grades would have predicted. I figured that was due to a more stable home life without the constant natter of her embittered grandmother.</p>
<p>Ginny became especially attached to me during this time. She was a young girl that needed lots of hugs and touching to keep her emotionally healthy. There were some nights&ndash;especially right after Jamie died&ndash; that she had to sleep with me. I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it; it was just what a dad was supposed to do for his little girl.</p>
<p>Ginny finished sixth grade (she was the youngest in her class) and looked forward to a summer of lounging by the pool. I had to work, of course, but planned to take some time off here and there to take her hiking, camping and to various places around California.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first, I think I need some new clothes,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Especially a new swim suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked her over. Yes, she had grown. Probably a couple of inches taller now than when I first met her the previous October. Her breasts were also swelling out some too. (Warning! Danger! Will Robinson!) I don&rsquo;t remember seeing any bras in her stuff so that meant that I was going to have to take her girlie shopping. Oh, boy! I hoped that there would be some kind sales lady there who would have pity on me and not think I was a pervert.</p>
<p>So one Saturday morning I took a deep breath and went shopping with Ginny. It wasn&rsquo;t nearly as bad as I had imagined. There was a sales lady who, once she found out I was a single dad, was very helpful. Ginny got a whole new wardrobe: undies, bras (well, training bras), tee shirts, jeans and a swim suit. I still don&rsquo;t know what I was thinking when I said yes to her buying a bikini&ndash;I told her only if she gets a one piece for those more public swim events. (I was imagining boys in her class drooling over her in the bikini.)</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day so I decided that we should go to the beach. It was a bit of a drive down to Half Moon Bay, but the weather was perfect. Surprisingly few people were on the beach so I let Ginny use her new bikini. She quickly changed in the restroom and reappeared wearing her flip-flops, bikini bottom and a tee shirt over her top. I already had my swim shorts on. She ran down to the water&rsquo;s edge and shrieked at how cold it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like back east,&rdquo; I said, joining her in the water after dropping our stuff on a blanket in the dry sand.</p>
<p>Another wave rushed up and covered our feet, climbing up our legs. I noticed then that her bikini bottom was pulled tight against her crotch leaving little to the imagination about her pussy. My goodness! Her pussy lips looked large! I felt my dick stirring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only way to overcome it is just to plunge in,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>I took my shirt off and put it on the pile of our stuff. Ginny bit her lip then took her tee-shirt off and stood there wearing only the thinnest and skimpiest of cloths. Her tiny tits were invisible&ndash;not visible mounds at all. But her nipples were cold and pushed out against the fabric like small marbles.</p>
<p>We romped in the ocean waves for a half hour or so. It was infectious laughter that Ginny had. I so enjoyed hearing her laugh and giggle and squeal with delight.</p>
<p>Afterwards we dried off and I realized that we should have put the sunscreen on first! Oh well, some is better than none! We took turns spreading it on each other&rsquo;s back and shoulders. Her hands were cold but began warming up as she massaged the lotion into my skin. She had a firm touch. I remembered how she would give Jamie back massages to relieve the tension. Jamie! My mind wandered and I felt a catch in my heart. And now Ginny was here helping me in whatever way. Jamie&rsquo;s words came back to me: &ldquo;There may be a time when she can help you out in all sorts of ways.&rdquo; Well, maybe so.</p>
<p>As I rubbed the lotion into Ginny, my hands discovered how delightful it was to touch her skin. As I massaged her shoulders, I looked down over her front and saw that her tits really were growing. They were wide swellings on either side of her nipples which were much more visible when she arched her shoulders back. It was all I could do to keep from lifting her bikini top up and rubbing lotion all over those tiny tits. Putting the lotion on her lower back was also just as dangerous. I wanted to explore lower and lower.</p>
<p>My dick had gone out and erected a huge tent. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I was going to do about that so I suddenly sat down, plopped a towel on my lap and started getting the sandwiches out to eat.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the afternoon building a sand castle, exploring the beach and climbing on rocks at the far end of the beach. We left about 6. On the drive home, I chastised myself for having sexual thoughts about Ginny. &ldquo;She was only 11 and a half,&rdquo; I reminded myself. &ldquo;But she is beautiful,&rdquo; another voice whispered back.</p>
<p>During the next few weeks she turned into a bit of a tease. She would think nothing about cavorting around the house in just her panties&ndash;she gave the excuse that they were so cute that she wanted to wear them everywhere. Or her thin, short night shirt with nothing at all underneath. I got a lot of peek-a-boos of her ass and swelling tits, but almost nothing of her cunt. I tried to ignore it, but I was beginning to have a permanent hard-on while I was at home.</p>
<p>Several weeks later I took her camping up in the Sierras. Beautiful little spot up off the Stanislaus River &ndash; and very few people were in the camp ground either. We set up the three man tent (you know, that means 2 people with a little bit of room for your gear), and then took a long hike.</p>
<p>We had a nice campfire that we warmed our food over then played several card games till I was really tired. I had borrowed some pads and an extra old sleeping bag that I brought along with mine. We quickly changed and settled down for the night. Ginny was a bit of a paradox at times. Out in the great outdoors, she was embarrassed about dropping her pants to pee or poop &ndash; and she didn&rsquo;t want me around to accidently see her. But in the tent, she had no hesitation about taking her things off and changing in front of me &ndash; even with the flash light on bright.</p>
<p>She was cute &ndash; her tan had quickly come back after a couple of weeks of swimming nearly every day in the apartment pool. Her tits were delightfully tiny and puffy, topped with dark areolas. I caught my breath as she slipped out of her pants and panties. Her pussy was completely bare &ndash; devoid of any hair. Her labia were very puffy and pronounced. It seemed that her slit was much longer and started high up than Jamie&rsquo;s did.</p>
<p>I quickly busied myself with changing but decided to keep my dick covered. Although it was doing its best to be noticed.</p>
<p>I turned the light out and we went to sleep fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Sometime after midnight, Ginny woke me up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without giving it too much thought I told her to climb in with me and place her sleeping bag over us both. She was like an ice cube. And she was shivering. Suddenly I was awake. Her icy fingers clasped onto my arm. I flinched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ginny! You are like an iceberg! You have to keep your cold hands off my bare skin&ndash;at least till they warm up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grunted something then wrapped her arms around me and hugged me tightly, trying to suck every ounce of warmth from my body. I coaxed her to turn around and I wrapped my arms around her as we lay side by side, nesting like spoons. I was vaguely aware of how close my dick was to her ass, but I knew that she needed to get warm first.</p>
<p>As we were drifting off to sleep, I noticed that she wasn&rsquo;t shivering anymore. At some point she pulled my hands in tighter around her. My mind flashed in a panic of recognition as I felt her tits through her tee-shirt. But to sleep we both went. I had half memories of feeling her butt grinding against my dick, I also recalled turning over&ndash;difficult in a sleeping bag with two&ndash;and her hands reaching around me and holding me close to her body.</p>
<p>I awoke in the morning with her left hand buried under us, lightly cupping my ass. Her other hand was draped over my front, resting on top of a raging hard-on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Daddy,&rdquo; she whispered in my ear once she saw me moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do. On one hand my hard-on demanded attention and her hand draped there was threatening to start a riot. On the other hand I was embarrassed by the situation and desperately wanted it to just go away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for keeping me warm last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, Ginny.&rdquo; I breathed deeply and tried to force my pecker down. But I had to pee too. It was piss hard. And her hand rested lightly on top adding to the stimulation. &ldquo;I think I need to get up and take care of some things,&rdquo; I finally decided.</p>
<p>I unzipped the sleeping bag and scooted out. My shorts were tenting grotesquely. Ginny quickly pulled the covers back over her then stared at my crotch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s it all like that?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I played dumb trying to buy some time as I fumbled with getting a fresh shirt on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your shorts are sticking out like you have a log in there,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes a guy wakes up in the morning with his dick all hard like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she paused for a moment then said, &ldquo;Can I see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re going to have to since I&rsquo;m changing.&rdquo; No going back now. I slipped my shorts down and my pecker sprang to attention. I knelt on the sleeping bag, completely naked with my dick twitching and pointing ludicrously toward the sky. I don&rsquo;t remember the last time it felt so engorged and hard!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing like I imagined that it would be,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, on the contrary, it feel kinda nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lights went on in her head and her eyes grew large. &ldquo;Oh! Is that how it looks when it&rsquo;s ready for sex?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded and slipped a new shirt on. Suddenly I felt her warm hands touching my dick. I groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did that hurt?&rdquo; she asked, quickly taking her hands away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not hurt,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Just surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She immediately put both hands back on my dick which twitched in happy response. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s so warm and soft!&rdquo; She purred. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so hard all at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not supposed to be doing that,&rdquo; I said, turning my dick away from her, which took every bit of will power I had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two reasons. Both would get me in deep legal trouble. First I&rsquo;m your dad. Second you are a minor&ndash;underage&ndash; and that would be a felony for me to touch you or have you touch me sexually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow. Is this sex?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; I fibbed. &ldquo;But in the eyes of the law, this is my sex organ and so I would be guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I quickly finished putting on new underwear and my jeans then went out to take care of business. And the first thing I had to do was spank the monkey else I would have never been able to pee.</p>
<p>We spent the day hiking, and playing in the stream. But night time descended again and threatened to be colder than the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to freeze tonight,&rdquo; Ginny said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m curling up with you and we&rsquo;ll both stay warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t come up with an alternative, so she crawled in next to me and went to sleep. I was a little leery of how Mr. Woody would react, so I started the night facing away from her. Didn&rsquo;t matter. I woke up in the middle of the night facing the other way, my dick raging hard, embedded in between her legs and one of her legs thrown up over my leg. Dang! I was hot and bothered!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you awake, Daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now. What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You turned over and that woke me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. It&rsquo;s okay. I then started wondering what it would be like to have sex. I know we aren&rsquo;t really having sex, but I was just pretending. You pecker was all hard again and it was already rubbing on my privates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mind reeled. She was pretending to have sex? With me? Her dad!?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, we shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only pretend, daddy,&rdquo; she softly said. Her face was right next to mine and I felt her breath on my cheek. &ldquo;Besides, you&rsquo;re supposed to tell me about the birds and the bees sometime. Right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to untangle myself from her and turn away but she held onto me tightly. That and how binding the sleeping bag was. I gave up and just held still. She held onto me tightly and her leg wrapped around me even tighter still. That caused her crotch to grind in closer on my dick. It twitch again. She giggled and wiggled her hips back against Mr. Woody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is dangerous, Ginny,&rdquo; I whispered, finally holding her tightly in response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Mamma told me how you and she used to have intimate times.&rdquo; She stopped and giggled. &ldquo;She said that when she showed you her bobs you nearly died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started to protest, then laughed instead. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that memory in a long time!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma also told me how I was made, how you two made love just before you had to move away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did she tell you all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bits and pieces here and there. But she made sure that I knew that you two made love and it was an incredible time and that&rsquo;s how I came to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I held her close and smelled her hair. Ginny was so much like Jamie in so many ways&ndash;especially her directness. She knew what she wanted and she was going to get it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ginny, this would change everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it would make it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only 11,&rdquo; I protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were only 15 when you and mom started messing around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we were about the same age. That&rsquo;s a big difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she whispered back. &ldquo;I want you to touch me. I am almost melting on the inside thinking about you touching me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t right, Ginny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I want to touch you too. I want to give you the sort of pleasure that you&rsquo;re missing now that Mamma&rsquo;s gone. She told me how much a man needs a woman. But she didn&rsquo;t tell me how much a woman would want a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was losing my grip on reality. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have sex, Ginny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t have sex. But let&rsquo;s be intimate and you can touch me and I can touch you.&rdquo; She reached down between us and freed my rock-hard dick from my shorts then ground her pussy against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ginny. We would be in so much trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one needs to know.&rdquo; Then she planted her lips on mine and wouldn&rsquo;t let me talk. Instead she began sucking on my lips and running her tongue over my lips and teeth. I couldn&rsquo;t think straight. All I could think of was how incredible it felt. I began to kiss her back. Her tongue snaked into my mouth. My dick jumped and grew in length. I began humping my dick against her leg and pounding it up against her pussy which was still clothed in her shorts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I want to be naked and feel you naked with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dang! She was directing the events just like her mom did some 13 years before. In a few short moments we were completely naked and rubbing our bodies together. My dick ached it was so engorged. I ran my hands over her back and ass, cupping her ass cheeks in both hands as I gyrated my hips forward into her groin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about ready to cum,&rdquo; I moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too late. I spurted gobs of jism into her crotch. I slammed my dick into her groin as tight as it would go and held onto her ass. I know I made a lot of weird grunting-moaning sounds.</p>
<p>When the orgasm finally subsided, I relaxed and melted in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Ginny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her finger on my lips and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be. That was fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I made a mess all over you and this is something that a dad shouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you meant by cum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s when I release all that sperm and stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you could have made a baby right then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it went up in your pussy and if you were fertile right then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wow! I want to see!&rdquo; She pulled back the sleeping bag and found the flashlight. I blinked at the brightness but laughed at how eager she was to see the white gobs that plastered her legs and pussy. Dang! White gobs all over her bare pussy. She ran a finger through the stuff then sniffed it. &ldquo;Mamma said that some girls like to taste it.&rdquo; She licked it and made a face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird!&rdquo; She grabbed her towel and started mopping the mess up. &ldquo;Did Mamma eat you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sometimes did eat each other. I don&rsquo;t know if your mom ever like the taste of cum, but she said that she loved getting me off like that. It made her happy to see me have so much fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; she commented, as she mopped the jism from my deflated Willie. &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; her hand stopped on my dick. &ldquo;You ate her too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Boys eat girls and girls eat boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy moley! You put your mouth right on her&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On her pussy?&rdquo; I finished. &ldquo;Yes. And I suppose that your next question is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you eat me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t lie.</p>
<p>I turned the flashlight out because I didn&rsquo;t need a light to find her. I grabbed her playfully and started kissing her neck, moving down to her tiny tits. My tongue flicked her nipples and I felt them harden. She gasped and grasped my head, pressing it closer to her chest. I sucked one nipple entirely into my mouth, played with it, then did the same to the other nipple. Back and forth for several minutes. My hands were rubbing her small lumps of breasts and I was getting horny again.</p>
<p>I decided that doing a 69 would keep her a bit more covered and a bit warmer. It also allowed my dick to dangle in front of her face. Eventually she would feel it and figure out something to do with it. I dove between her legs and found her warmth radiating her aroma up and away. She parted her knees, letting them flop open. I suddenly had unrestricted access to the smoothest pussy with the longest and deepest slit I had ever felt&ndash;or licked. And lick it I did. I luxuriated in its smoothness. Her labia were puffy and springy under my lickings and gentle nibblings.</p>
<p>I felt her squirm and wiggle and gyrate her hips upward toward my eager mouth. About that same time, my dick tickled her nose. Suddenly her hands were all over it, stuffing it into her mouth. Oh Dang! That felt good! I buried my face further into her pussy, sticking my tongue deep into her folds. I felt her little button, hard nubbins, under my tongue. I sucked on her folds and felt her inner labia open up further. My tongue reached a barrier and I felt her jump. Yup! She was a virgin. I promised myself that I would NOT take that tonight. If I played my cards right, I would have that another time.</p>
<p>She licked my dick like there was no tomorrow. Her hand were rubbing it up and down and her mouth was sucking on the tip. I was certainly going to have another cumming before long.</p>
<p>On one hand I couldn&rsquo;t believe how quickly I went from &ldquo;daddy&rdquo; to &ldquo;lover&rdquo;! Of course, she had been teasing me all summer. But now, I caved and I couldn&rsquo;t stop even if I wanted to. I placed my hands under her ass and cupped each cheek in my hands. As I licked her pussy, I kneaded her butt cheeks, pulling them wider apart. There was so much drool from my mouth and juice from her pussy that her butt crack was slippery. I ran a finger up and down, thrilling at the touch of her anus. I felt it flinch as I touched it the first couple of times then I rested one finger on it and pressed gently. She pushed back against my finger.</p>
<p>Okay, Ginny, I thought. In we go!</p>
<p>I pressed my pussy-juice-slickened finger hard against her anus and it just popped in. Almost no resistance at all&ndash;all the way up past the second knuckle! At the same time I sucked her clitoris hard and worked the fingers of my other hand around the fleshy folds of her labia. She stiffened and clamped down hard on my dick. Her legs locked around my head and her ass sphincter tightened hard around my finger. At the same time, the jism rose in my balls and erupted from my cock. I distantly hear her moan then sputter as my jism filled her mouth. I suppose it wasn&rsquo;t fair to fill her that full that quickly, but I couldn&rsquo;t help myself in that.</p>
<p>Finally she relaxed and I pulled my finger out of her ass. She rolled me off her and sat up. She opened the tent zipper and spat my spunk outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Daddy. I couldn&rsquo;t swallow that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pulled her next to me and we snuggled down into the sleeping bag again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you swallow or not, Ginny. You are already doing more than you should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll keep doing it, Daddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We snuggled in closer, my semi-limp dick cradled in her ass crack and my hands wrapped around her front, lightly playing with her nipples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t tell anyone,&rdquo; I reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way! You are mine. All mine! And I want to keep it that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how my long-lost daughter became my lover. I eventually took her cherry, but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
