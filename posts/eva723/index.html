  "articleBody": "“Will you take my picture please?” It was small girl asking, no more than ten. She was wearing a flared pink dress and in her long blonde hair was a pink ribbon that matched her dress. On her feet were pink mary janes with white socks. Socks with a little lace trim on the turnover.\nThe woman looked up from staring through the viewfinder at the huge cathedral in front of her. She was old – about fifty or so – and though she had tried to keep her figure over the years there was a thickening of the waist and a heaviness about her legs. She had a mop of brown hair run through with streaks of grey but she had a pleasant, round face, and along with her neat dark blue plain skirt and formal white blouse looked matronly. She was had flat, black shoes and her legs showed she was wearing pale, flesh coloured stockings. She was, despite being tidy and clean, unremarkable.\nHer name was Josie and she had no idea why this little girl should ask. “Sweetheart,” said the woman, looking down at the little girl. “Where’s your mummy?”\n“She’s gone over there,” the child made a vague gesture towards a group of other people standing a little way off. People on some trip or tour and looking, like Josie was, at the ancient building and mature trees around it. Josie looked where the kid waved but there was no one looking round anxiously for a child who had wandered off.\n“I think your mummy would want to know where you are,” said the woman. She didn’t want an interruption; she wanted to get the photo of the cathedral taken and move on. The light was going and she really needed to capture the glow of the late afternoon sunlight on the huge spire before it was too late. If the picture was as good as she hoped she might be able to sell it to some agency or library.\nPaying hobbies needed attention, and since she had discovered photography a whole new world had opened up. After her husband Terence had left Josie for a younger woman she had needed a distraction, something to take her mind of dwelling on her misfortune. He had left all his cameras behind as he fled to live with that rather more vacant-minded thirty year old. On her own Josie had slowly discovered a surprisingly fascinating world. Turned out she was quite good at taking photos too, and among all his bits and pieces (she had no idea he had so much he kept from her) she found a wealth of cameras and equipment.\n“I just want you to take my picture,” said the small girl, eying the woman’s camera, one of ex-husband’s favourites. “I like having my photograph taken,” she added.\n“I am sure you do, sweetheart,” said the woman, wishing the mother would reclaim the kid.\n“My name’s not sweetheart. It’s Lauren.”\n“Lauren,” repeated Josie. “Nice name. Well, Lauren, I don’t usually take pictures of children,” She didn’t add that it was too risky these days, what with the paranoid and the idiotic seeing pedophilia everywhere. Some things, she knew, people had to keep secret. The woman glanced back at the cathedral, and felt a pang of dismay: the sun had gone behind a cloud and the light running along the spire had gone. Indeed, clouds were building up and the way the wind stirred the trees there was rain in the air. The moment had gone.\n“My mummy lets people take pictures of me,” said Lauren. “‘Specially nice ladies.”\nJosie smiled. Am I nice lady? She thought. Terence didn’t think so, but he was gone. The only person who seemed to think she was nice was her daughter Kathy. The young woman was 23 and lived some way off with her boyfriend. Sam, so Josie didn’t see her as often as she’d like. Oh yes, and her friend Helen of course. Mustn’t forget staid old dull Helen, the woman thought. Wouldn’t even come out to look at a few old buildings while her friend Josie took photos. “I can’t take your picture, Lauren,” said Josie. “Mummy might not like it if I did it without asking her permission.”\nPlus, Josie thought, what would she do with a portrait of a little girl? More to the point, what should she say to get rid of this child? Josie didn’t want to be an unpaid child-minder, pretty though the little girl was. Her interest was taking pictures, not supervising kids.\nAs Josie stood, scanning the various groups of people, the child moved alongside her and slipped her hand into the woman’s free hand. Josie was a little startled; she didn’t expect any contact. The child wormed her hand deeper into the woman’s larger hand, and smiled up at her.\nA gap-toothed smile, but it didn’t spoil the kid’s looks at all. If anything, it made her look more appealing. In the depths of Josie’s chest, the woman’s heart missed a beat. She was anxious to go home before it rained and had briefly contemplated telling the child to go find her mother, but she couldn’t just let her go. Anything could happen to her among all these people.\n“Your little girl?” Asked a young woman nearby, catching Josie’s eye. Her accent was from the States, and she had that wide-mouthed look so many US citizens had. “She’s so pretty and she looks so heavenly!”\nJosie opened her mouth to say, well, no she wasn’t hers but before she could say anything, Lauren chimed in. “She’s my best friend,” she said, with a grin. “She takes my picture and looks after me while mummy’s away.”\nJosie felt her face colour up a little. She wasn’t sure any of this was particularly accurate.\n“Well, may I say,” drawled the woman, “you are one fine young lady and I hope you look after your friend.” She looked questioningly at Josie. “Sorry, I don’t know your name, honey.”\n“Josie,” said the woman holding Lauren’s hand. “Josie Talbot.” As soon as she said it she wondered if it had been wise to give her name out. If someone thought she had abducted the child then revealing her name wasn’t too bright.\n“My name’s Lauren Butler,” said the child. “Lauren Andrea Butler. That’s ‘cos Andrea’s my mummy’s name.”\n“Isn’t that cute?” said the American woman. She was a shade taller than Josie and had a good figure: ordinarily Josie didn’t care how other women looked but this one had a high, young bust, well rounded hips and between them a waist that would be considered well-corseted in the old days. Couldn’t have been more than 24 inches if it was that. “Now, Lauren Andrea Butler,” said the woman. “I’m called Jamie Lee Larsen. Nice to meet ya. Why don’t you ask your best friend if she would like to come with me and share a coffee – sorry, maybe a cup of tea – and you can have a lovely ice-cream? Whaddya say, honey?”\n“Yes please,” grinned Lauren, almost jumping up and down with happiness. “I like ice-cream a lot.” Then up at Josie: “Can we go please, aunt Josie? Please?”\nAunt Josie? Josie’s head spun. “I don’t know,” she began to say. The woman took a breath. She would have to explain how ten minutes ago she had never seen this child before, and her mother was somewhere nearby and–\nThe rain hit them. Big, fat raindrops. “Come on,” said the American, taking little Lauren’s other hand. “There’s a cafe over here and we can get out of the darn English weather!” She was pulling the child and the child was going with her and the girl was still holding Josie’s hand tightly. As she allowed herself to be tugged the woman looked desperately round, hoping the mother would be heading their way to claim her girl. But the groups of tourists were dispersing in the sudden rain and no one was coming their way.\nJosie followed, and wondered what the hell she had got herself into.\n–\nJosie insisted they sat in the front window of the cafe, where they could see the place where all the tourists had been, but the rain ran in rivulets down the window outside and the inside steamed up. Josie couldn’t see much at all. Every time someone came in to the cafe, dripping wet from the rain, she looked up hopefully that it would be Lauren’s mother.\nNo one looked their way, or if they did they never said a word. Not at all like Jamie Lee who chattered away and encouraged little Lauren to talk (which she did about anything, though the two seemed to be getting on well) and have more ice-cream. Josie had hardly touched her tea as anxiety began to get the better of her.\n“You okay, hon?” asked the American woman. “You worried about something?”\n“I’d like to know where Lauren’s mother is,” Josie said. “I’m sure she should be here by now.”\nThat was when Lauren dropped a bombshell. “She went off with a man.”\n“Who was that, angel?” asked Jamie Lee.\n“Dunno. Said he wanted to give Mummy something. Said he would give her one.”\nOh fuck, thought Josie. Lauren’s mother is a prostitute, working the tourist traffic. Somewhere round the back of a pile of old stonework she would be having a knee-trembler or giving a man in a Hawaiian shirt a blow job. How much would she make for swallowing some German tourists’s semen? Would she take it in Euros or insist on Sterling? This, Josie thought grimly, was a mess.\n“Well,” said Jamie Lee, not looking concerned. “Maybe your mommy will be back soon, when the man has given her what she needs.”\nJosie wondered if this American female was being stupid. Surely she grasped what was going on? But apparently not. But then, she could now leave the girl with this Yank. What happened then was not her concern. Mummy with the wet lips could find her daughter with Jamie Lee. “I have to go,” she said, standing up.\n“Don’t go, aunt Josie” said Lauren looking up at the standing woman. “You haven’t taken my picture yet and you promised.”\nJosie wanted to say she had done no such thing and the American woman was looking up at her, slightly amused at all this. “Yeah, don’t go, aunt Josie,” echoed Jamie Lee. “In fact, why not come over to my hotel room with little Lauren and take a picture or two there?” It wasn’t really said as a question.\n“No, another time,” said Josie, feeling that the sooner she got away the better.\n“Oh, but I insist,” said the American, suddenly sounding a lot less friendly. “After all, wouldn’t it be awful if someone said you’d taken this child?”\nYes it would, thought Josie glumly. “But… what if Lauren’s mother comes by?”\n“I will leave my hotel room phone number at the counter. One of the staff will tell anyone who comes round looking for her daughter.”\nIt seemed a dangerous plan, and Josie didn’t want anything to do with it. She wanted to say: ‘Listen you naive cow… Lauren’s mother when she has finished sucking cock will call the cops before she starts asking some dumb waitresses in an overpriced cafe if they’d seen her child.’ But she didn’t. She just sat back down.\n“Oh goody,” chuckled Lauren. “I’m gonna have my picture taken.”\n–\nJamie Lee’s hotel room was surprisingly large. Most hotels for tourists offered narrow boxes with a bathroom in the corner and two single beds a foot apart. This one had big windows that didn’t look out on car park, a bathroom that wasn’t bolted on and a double bed. Plus enough room to actually swing a cat, if you had one handy.\nLauren ran and bounced on the big bed, laughing as she did so as soon as they got in. Josie had serious misgivings about this, but perhaps if she gave in now she could escape later. Leave this bitch Jamie Lee with the prostitute’s daughter.\nThey had taken a taxi from the cafe and right up until they left Josie had prayed the mother would come in and find Lauren, but she hadn’t shown up and the child didn’t seem distressed. Nor did Jamie Lee seem worried either. She chatted to the girl in the back of the cab as it swished through the rain and Josie sat silently staring out of the window. She was sure she would be found guilty of kidnapping or some such crime.\nJamie Lee had paid with a twenty pound note and said the cab driver could keep the change. As the trip to her hotel had cost less than half that, the driver looked very pleased with his tip.\nOnce they were in the room Josie resolved to get this done with quickly. She put her handbag down carefully on the side and then turned to the girl. “Okay, pet, sit still on this chair and I’ll take your picture. A nice portrait.” The woman indicated a chair near the window, by an antique looking writing desk. Just one picture, she thought. Don’t even care if it turns out okay. I’ll give them a false address and disappear, saying they could call round for the photo.\n“Not my face, silly,” said the child from where she lay on her back on the bed, propped up on her elbows. “I like pictures of all of me.” To Josie’s horror the girl had her knees up and legs apart. Her pink skirt fell back over her hips and her white knickers were on show. “And then I can take my knickers off and you can take a picture of my pussy.”\nJosie gaped at the girl and shot a look at Jamie Lee as if to say, ‘Hey, this child’s a pervert. Let’s get her out of here.’ But Jamie Lee wasn’t looking shocked. Far from it.\n“Good idea, angel,” the American woman said. She moved over to the bed and to Josie’s consternation took hold of the child’s knickers and tugged them down the kid’s thin legs. “Let’s have these silly panties off first and do the pussy shot straight off,” she said.\n“Knickers, not panties,” corrected the girl, but she didn’t resist. She even lifted her hips to make it easier for Jamie Lee to slide them down. They came off and the Yank sniffed the crotch approvingly.\n“Smells real delicious,” the younger woman said.\n“Cool,” said the girl with another trademark chuckle.\nJosie couldn’t believe what she was seeing but equally couldn’t take her eyes of the girls’ small, bare slit. Her pussy was there right in front of her, a thin line of immature cunt. It struck Josie that the child was probably like her mother, some sort of future hooker or good-time girl in training.\nThen, even more to Josie’s astonishment, the American leaned in and planted a kiss on Lauren’s lips. First on the lips on her pretty face and then on the little one’s pussy lips. And of the two the one between the child’s legs lasted longer.\n“Oh shit,” whispered Josie and fled to the door.\nIt was locked and behind her Jamie Lee and Lauren were chuckling together.\n“Think you better take the pictures, don’t you?” Asked Jamie Lee. “Then I might think about letting you out, Josie.”\n–\nJosie took, all in all, some fifty pictures though she lost count along the way. There were shots of the child skirt up and panties down. Pictures of her naked, posing in a variety of ways on the bed. There images of her with her hands between her legs fingering herself. Photos of the child squatting on the bed too, her little slit over the face of the American. Shots where the young woman was licking upwards, her tongue tip dancing on the child’s cunnie.\nThere were shots of the child undressing Jamie Lee, revealing the tight body shaping corset the woman wore under her dress. Photos that showed the child squeezing the American’s small, high tits before they were flipped out of the black lace half-cups and the child sucked the large, proud nipples eagerly. She even bit them so Jamie Lee’s face creased in pain, but the Yank didn’t object. Then more photos of the girl kissing the woman and fisting her or as she sucked at the young woman’s nether lips (“Not garters at all,” sniggered the child as she played with her suspenders) and then slapping the American’s tits having stuffed Jamie Lee’s panties in her mouth.\nThe child lay face down on the bed, her cute little derriere on offer and the woman’s face between her small buttocks, tongue dancing in the little girl’s back hole and Lauren grinning over her shoulder at what the naughty woman was doing to her. Finally photos of the child fucking a tearful Jamie Lee with her bare little foot. A casual, slow and deliberate humiliation, drawn out to deny the woman a swift orgasm. Keeping her hovering on the brink of satisfaction. Josie thought the child was indeed cruel as she got in close to capture the wriggling toes of the child disappearing into the woman’s cunt.\nBut the girl finally allowed the American to climax and gratefully Jamie Lee thanked her by sucking her little cunnie as the child lay back, purring with pleasure.\nPerhaps it was the excitement that was slowly overwhelming Josie, but at some point Jamie Lee took the camera and then photographed Lauren foot fucking the naked, older woman. She even took pictures of the child sucking on Josie’s older, sagging tits while she reached down and fingered the Englishwoman’s cunt. Making the older woman beg for more and plead to be allowed to cum but being told no, the naughty lady had to wait.\nAnd wait and wait until she was finally permitted to climax with a shout and a score of gushing, heartfelt thanks.\n“Now you two kiss,” said the girl as she hopped off the bed. “Wanna watch you play lesbians. Do that kiss ’n’ licking thing.”\nSadly the child din’t take any photos of the older naked woman and the corseted American locked in a 69 on the bed, satisfying each other. But the Lauren was too busy slapping any bottom she could, urging the bitches to lick faster.\nThe bitches gladly licked faster.\n–\nIt took the naked Josie the best part of 45 minutes to get out of the web of ropes they’d used to bind her to the chair, and another minute to retrieve her clothes where they lay in the bath. Either Lauren or Jamie Lee had pissed on them and they were cold and sopping wet. But there was a hair dryer in the room and Josie sat on the edge of the crumpled bed and dried them off as best she could before pulling them on.\nOf course she wouldn’t go to the police, or even for that matter the hotel management. As Jamie Lee had said on the way out with her niece Lauren the cops will, before anything else, prefer to take a dim view of women having sex with underage girls. Blackmail would be much further down the list.\nBest to let this one go, hon, the American had said. “And thanks for the camera,” she grinned. “We’ll keep the photos too for our own pleasure, but at least you have the memories.”\n“And I really loved playing with you,” said little Lauren as she waved goodbye at the door, holding Jamie Lee’s hand. “But I love my aunt Jamie more. I liked slapping you, Josie, and I love how you licked my pussy. Almost as good as with aunty.”\nI liked it too, thought Josie. If I could do it again, I would. Oh well, not entirely hopeless.\nJosie reflected that there never was a hooker mother. Just a scam involving aunt Jamie Lee and the little girl, a sort of pleading ’take my picture lady’ routine. No doubt other old and lonely women had fallen for that one, and Josie was just another victim. By the time she got dressed the pair had been long gone, and they probably hadn’t even paid the hotel bill, either. High time, thought Josie with a sigh, to slip out myself before it gets too late. Go home and chalk this one up to misadventure.\nThe woman picked up her handbag and checked it. They’d taken her money of course, but not her credit cards. Well, that was something.\nBut they hadn’t found the small video camera hidden in the side of the bag, the one that had silently looked out on to the room and silently recorded everything in the room. The quality wouldn’t be great, but it would be enough to enjoy when Josie masturbated in front of the computer.\nShame her still camera was gone, but there were a few more for her to take out with her when she went out taking photographs of castles and things. Going out with her handbag’s secret movie camera so she could film innocent little girls at play. And it was surprising how many bored young kids there were at dusty old monuments, fed up with waiting around. Girls who would do cartwheels and maybe pull down their knickers for the kind old lady if no one was looking.\nThe end\n",

      What should a woman do when a pretty child wants her picture taken and she is so appealing and alone and there&#39;s no one else around to help?

  </header> 
  <div class="post-content"><p>&ldquo;Will you take my picture please?&rdquo; It was small girl asking, no more than ten. She was wearing a flared pink dress and in her long blonde hair was a pink ribbon that matched her dress. On her feet were pink mary janes with white socks. Socks with a little lace trim on the turnover.</p>
<p>The woman looked up from staring through the viewfinder at the huge cathedral in front of her. She was old &ndash; about fifty or so &ndash; and though she had tried to keep her figure over the years there was a thickening of the waist and a heaviness about her legs. She had a mop of brown hair run through with streaks of grey but she had a pleasant, round face, and along with her neat dark blue plain skirt and formal white blouse looked matronly. She was had flat, black shoes and her legs showed she was wearing pale, flesh coloured stockings. She was, despite being tidy and clean, unremarkable.</p>
<p>Her name was Josie and she had no idea why this little girl should ask. &ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; said the woman, looking down at the little girl. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your mummy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone over there,&rdquo; the child made a vague gesture towards a group of other people standing a little way off. People on some trip or tour and looking, like Josie was, at the ancient building and mature trees around it. Josie looked where the kid waved but there was no one looking round anxiously for a child who had wandered off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think your mummy would want to know where you are,&rdquo; said the woman. She didn&rsquo;t want an interruption; she wanted to get the photo of the cathedral taken and move on. The light was going and she really needed to capture the glow of the late afternoon sunlight on the huge spire before it was too late. If the picture was as good as she hoped she might be able to sell it to some agency or library.</p>
<p>Paying hobbies needed attention, and since she had discovered photography a whole new world had opened up. After her husband Terence had left Josie for a younger woman she had needed a distraction, something to take her mind of dwelling on her misfortune. He had left all his cameras behind as he fled to live with that rather more vacant-minded thirty year old. On her own Josie had slowly discovered a surprisingly fascinating world. Turned out she was quite good at taking photos too, and among all his bits and pieces (she had no idea he had so much he kept from her) she found a wealth of cameras and equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want you to take my picture,&rdquo; said the small girl, eying the woman&rsquo;s camera, one of ex-husband&rsquo;s favourites. &ldquo;I like having my photograph taken,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you do, sweetheart,&rdquo; said the woman, wishing the mother would reclaim the kid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s not sweetheart. It&rsquo;s Lauren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lauren,&rdquo; repeated Josie. &ldquo;Nice name. Well, Lauren, I don&rsquo;t usually take pictures of children,&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t add that it was too risky these days, what with the paranoid and the idiotic seeing pedophilia everywhere. Some things, she knew, people had to keep secret. The woman glanced back at the cathedral, and felt a pang of dismay: the sun had gone behind a cloud and the light running along the spire had gone. Indeed, clouds were building up and the way the wind stirred the trees there was rain in the air. The moment had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mummy lets people take pictures of me,&rdquo; said Lauren. &ldquo;&lsquo;Specially nice ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josie smiled. Am I nice lady? She thought. Terence didn&rsquo;t think so, but he was gone. The only person who seemed to think she was nice was her daughter Kathy. The young woman was 23 and lived some way off with her boyfriend. Sam, so Josie didn&rsquo;t see her as often as she&rsquo;d like. Oh yes, and her friend Helen of course. Mustn&rsquo;t forget staid old dull Helen, the woman thought. Wouldn&rsquo;t even come out to look at a few old buildings while her friend Josie took photos. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take your picture, Lauren,&rdquo; said Josie. &ldquo;Mummy might not like it if I did it without asking her permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plus, Josie thought, what would she do with a portrait of a little girl? More to the point, what should she say to get rid of this child? Josie didn&rsquo;t want to be an unpaid child-minder, pretty though the little girl was. Her interest was taking pictures, not supervising kids.</p>
<p>As Josie stood, scanning the various groups of people, the child moved alongside her and slipped her hand into the woman&rsquo;s free hand. Josie was a little startled; she didn&rsquo;t expect any contact. The child wormed her hand deeper into the woman&rsquo;s larger hand, and smiled up at her.</p>
<p>A gap-toothed smile, but it didn&rsquo;t spoil the kid&rsquo;s looks at all. If anything, it made her look more appealing. In the depths of Josie&rsquo;s chest, the woman&rsquo;s heart missed a beat. She was anxious to go home before it rained and had briefly contemplated telling the child to go find her mother, but she couldn&rsquo;t just let her go. Anything could happen to her among all these people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your little girl?&rdquo; Asked a young woman nearby, catching Josie&rsquo;s eye. Her accent was from the States, and she had that wide-mouthed look so many US citizens had. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so pretty and she looks so heavenly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josie opened her mouth to say, well, no she wasn&rsquo;t hers but before she could say anything, Lauren chimed in. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my best friend,&rdquo; she said, with a grin. &ldquo;She takes my picture and looks after me while mummy&rsquo;s away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josie felt her face colour up a little. She wasn&rsquo;t sure any of this was particularly accurate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, may I say,&rdquo; drawled the woman, &ldquo;you are one fine young lady and I hope you look after your friend.&rdquo; She looked questioningly at Josie. &ldquo;Sorry, I don&rsquo;t know your name, honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josie,&rdquo; said the woman holding Lauren&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Josie Talbot.&rdquo; As soon as she said it she wondered if it had been wise to give her name out. If someone thought she had abducted the child then revealing her name wasn&rsquo;t too bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Lauren Butler,&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;Lauren Andrea Butler. That&rsquo;s &lsquo;cos Andrea&rsquo;s my mummy&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that cute?&rdquo; said the American woman. She was a shade taller than Josie and had a good figure: ordinarily Josie didn&rsquo;t care how other women looked but this one had a high, young bust, well rounded hips and between them a waist that would be considered well-corseted in the old days. Couldn&rsquo;t have been more than 24 inches if it was that. &ldquo;Now, Lauren Andrea Butler,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m called Jamie Lee Larsen. Nice to meet ya. Why don&rsquo;t you ask your best friend if she would like to come with me and share a coffee &ndash; sorry, maybe a cup of tea &ndash; and you can have a lovely ice-cream? Whaddya say, honey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes please,&rdquo; grinned Lauren, almost jumping up and down with happiness. &ldquo;I like ice-cream a lot.&rdquo; Then up at Josie: &ldquo;Can we go please, aunt Josie? Please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Josie? Josie&rsquo;s head spun. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she began to say. The woman took a breath. She would have to explain how ten minutes ago she had never seen this child before, and her mother was somewhere nearby and&ndash;</p>
<p>The rain hit them. Big, fat raindrops. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said the American, taking little Lauren&rsquo;s other hand. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cafe over here and we can get out of the darn English weather!&rdquo; She was pulling the child and the child was going with her and the girl was still holding Josie&rsquo;s hand tightly. As she allowed herself to be tugged the woman looked desperately round, hoping the mother would be heading their way to claim her girl. But the groups of tourists were dispersing in the sudden rain and no one was coming their way.</p>
<p>Josie followed, and wondered what the hell she had got herself into.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Josie insisted they sat in the front window of the cafe, where they could see the place where all the tourists had been, but the rain ran in rivulets down the window outside and the inside steamed up. Josie couldn&rsquo;t see much at all. Every time someone came in to the cafe, dripping wet from the rain, she looked up hopefully that it would be Lauren&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>No one looked their way, or if they did they never said a word. Not at all like Jamie Lee who chattered away and encouraged little Lauren to talk (which she did about anything, though the two seemed to be getting on well) and have more ice-cream. Josie had hardly touched her tea as anxiety began to get the better of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You okay, hon?&rdquo; asked the American woman. &ldquo;You worried about something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know where Lauren&rsquo;s mother is,&rdquo; Josie said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she should be here by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was when Lauren dropped a bombshell. &ldquo;She went off with a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that, angel?&rdquo; asked Jamie Lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. Said he wanted to give Mummy something. Said he would give her one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh fuck, thought Josie. Lauren&rsquo;s mother is a prostitute, working the tourist traffic. Somewhere round the back of a pile of old stonework she would be having a knee-trembler or giving a man in a Hawaiian shirt a blow job. How much would she make for swallowing some German tourists&rsquo;s semen? Would she take it in Euros or insist on Sterling? This, Josie thought grimly, was a mess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jamie Lee, not looking concerned. &ldquo;Maybe your mommy will be back soon, when the man has given her what she needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josie wondered if this American female was being stupid. Surely she grasped what was going on? But apparently not. But then, she could now leave the girl with this Yank. What happened then was not her concern. Mummy with the wet lips could find her daughter with Jamie Lee. &ldquo;I have to go,&rdquo; she said, standing up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, aunt Josie&rdquo; said Lauren looking up at the standing woman. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t taken my picture yet and you promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josie wanted to say she had done no such thing and the American woman was looking up at her, slightly amused at all this. &ldquo;Yeah, don&rsquo;t go, aunt Josie,&rdquo; echoed Jamie Lee. &ldquo;In fact, why not come over to my hotel room with little Lauren and take a picture or two there?&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t really said as a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, another time,&rdquo; said Josie, feeling that the sooner she got away the better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I insist,&rdquo; said the American, suddenly sounding a lot less friendly. &ldquo;After all, wouldn&rsquo;t it be awful if someone said you&rsquo;d taken this child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes it would, thought Josie glumly. &ldquo;But&hellip; what if Lauren&rsquo;s mother comes by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will leave my hotel room phone number at the counter. One of the staff will tell anyone who comes round looking for her daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed a dangerous plan, and Josie didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with it. She wanted to say: &lsquo;Listen you naive cow&hellip; Lauren&rsquo;s mother when she has finished sucking cock will call the cops before she starts asking some dumb waitresses in an overpriced cafe if they&rsquo;d seen her child.&rsquo; But she didn&rsquo;t. She just sat back down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh goody,&rdquo; chuckled Lauren. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna have my picture taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Jamie Lee&rsquo;s hotel room was surprisingly large. Most hotels for tourists offered narrow boxes with a bathroom in the corner and two single beds a foot apart. This one had big windows that didn&rsquo;t look out on car park, a bathroom that wasn&rsquo;t bolted on and a double bed. Plus enough room to actually swing a cat, if you had one handy.</p>
<p>Lauren ran and bounced on the big bed, laughing as she did so as soon as they got in. Josie had serious misgivings about this, but perhaps if she gave in now she could escape later. Leave this bitch Jamie Lee with the prostitute&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>They had taken a taxi from the cafe and right up until they left Josie had prayed the mother would come in and find Lauren, but she hadn&rsquo;t shown up and the child didn&rsquo;t seem distressed. Nor did Jamie Lee seem worried either. She chatted to the girl in the back of the cab as it swished through the rain and Josie sat silently staring out of the window. She was sure she would be found guilty of kidnapping or some such crime.</p>
<p>Jamie Lee had paid with a twenty pound note and said the cab driver could keep the change. As the trip to her hotel had cost less than half that, the driver looked very pleased with his tip.</p>
<p>Once they were in the room Josie resolved to get this done with quickly. She put her handbag down carefully on the side and then turned to the girl. &ldquo;Okay, pet, sit still on this chair and I&rsquo;ll take your picture. A nice portrait.&rdquo; The woman indicated a chair near the window, by an antique looking writing desk. Just one picture, she thought. Don&rsquo;t even care if it turns out okay. I&rsquo;ll give them a false address and disappear, saying they could call round for the photo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not my face, silly,&rdquo; said the child from where she lay on her back on the bed, propped up on her elbows. &ldquo;I like pictures of all of me.&rdquo; To Josie&rsquo;s horror the girl had her knees up and legs apart. Her pink skirt fell back over her hips and her white knickers were on show. &ldquo;And then I can take my knickers off and you can take a picture of my pussy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josie gaped at the girl and shot a look at Jamie Lee as if to say, &lsquo;Hey, this child&rsquo;s a pervert. Let&rsquo;s get her out of here.&rsquo; But Jamie Lee wasn&rsquo;t looking shocked. Far from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, angel,&rdquo; the American woman said. She moved over to the bed and to Josie&rsquo;s consternation took hold of the child&rsquo;s knickers and tugged them down the kid&rsquo;s thin legs. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have these silly panties off first and do the pussy shot straight off,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knickers, not panties,&rdquo; corrected the girl, but she didn&rsquo;t resist. She even lifted her hips to make it easier for Jamie Lee to slide them down. They came off and the Yank sniffed the crotch approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smells real delicious,&rdquo; the younger woman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; said the girl with another trademark chuckle.</p>
<p>Josie couldn&rsquo;t believe what she was seeing but equally couldn&rsquo;t take her eyes of the girls&rsquo; small, bare slit. Her pussy was there right in front of her, a thin line of immature cunt. It struck Josie that the child was probably like her mother, some sort of future hooker or good-time girl in training.</p>
<p>Then, even more to Josie&rsquo;s astonishment, the American leaned in and planted a kiss on Lauren&rsquo;s lips. First on the lips on her pretty face and then on the little one&rsquo;s pussy lips. And of the two the one between the child&rsquo;s legs lasted longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh shit,&rdquo; whispered Josie and fled to the door.</p>
<p>It was locked and behind her Jamie Lee and Lauren were chuckling together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you better take the pictures, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Asked Jamie Lee. &ldquo;Then I might think about letting you out, Josie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Josie took, all in all, some fifty pictures though she lost count along the way. There were shots of the child skirt up and panties down. Pictures of her naked, posing in a variety of ways on the bed. There images of her with her hands between her legs fingering herself. Photos of the child squatting on the bed too, her little slit over the face of the American. Shots where the young woman was licking upwards, her tongue tip dancing on the child&rsquo;s cunnie.</p>
<p>There were shots of the child undressing Jamie Lee, revealing the tight body shaping corset the woman wore under her dress. Photos that showed the child squeezing the American&rsquo;s small, high tits before they were flipped out of the black lace half-cups and the child sucked the large, proud nipples eagerly. She even bit them so Jamie Lee&rsquo;s face creased in pain, but the Yank didn&rsquo;t object. Then more photos of the girl kissing the woman and fisting her or as she sucked at the young woman&rsquo;s nether lips (&ldquo;Not garters at all,&rdquo; sniggered the child as she played with her suspenders) and then slapping the American&rsquo;s tits having stuffed Jamie Lee&rsquo;s panties in her mouth.</p>
<p>The child lay face down on the bed, her cute little derriere on offer and the woman&rsquo;s face between her small buttocks, tongue dancing in the little girl&rsquo;s back hole and Lauren grinning over her shoulder at what the naughty woman was doing to her. Finally photos of the child fucking a tearful Jamie Lee with her bare little foot. A casual, slow and deliberate humiliation, drawn out to deny the woman a swift orgasm. Keeping her hovering on the brink of satisfaction. Josie thought the child was indeed cruel as she got in close to capture the wriggling toes of the child disappearing into the woman&rsquo;s cunt.</p>
<p>But the girl finally allowed the American to climax and gratefully Jamie Lee thanked her by sucking her little cunnie as the child lay back, purring with pleasure.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the excitement that was slowly overwhelming Josie, but at some point Jamie Lee took the camera and then photographed Lauren foot fucking the naked, older woman. She even took pictures of the child sucking on Josie&rsquo;s older, sagging tits while she reached down and fingered the Englishwoman&rsquo;s cunt. Making the older woman beg for more and plead to be allowed to cum but being told no, the naughty lady had to wait.</p>
<p>And wait and wait until she was finally permitted to climax with a shout and a score of gushing, heartfelt thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you two kiss,&rdquo; said the girl as she hopped off the bed. &ldquo;Wanna watch you play lesbians. Do that kiss &rsquo;n&rsquo; licking thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadly the child din&rsquo;t take any photos of the older naked woman and the corseted American locked in a 69 on the bed, satisfying each other. But the Lauren was too busy slapping any bottom she could, urging the bitches to lick faster.</p>
<p>The bitches gladly licked faster.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>It took the naked Josie the best part of 45 minutes to get out of the web of ropes they&rsquo;d used to bind her to the chair, and another minute to retrieve her clothes where they lay in the bath. Either Lauren or Jamie Lee had pissed on them and they were cold and sopping wet. But there was a hair dryer in the room and Josie sat on the edge of the crumpled bed and dried them off as best she could before pulling them on.</p>
<p>Of course she wouldn&rsquo;t go to the police, or even for that matter the hotel management. As Jamie Lee had said on the way out with her niece Lauren the cops will, before anything else, prefer to take a dim view of women having sex with underage girls. Blackmail would be much further down the list.</p>
<p>Best to let this one go, hon, the American had said. &ldquo;And thanks for the camera,&rdquo; she grinned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep the photos too for our own pleasure, but at least you have the memories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I really loved playing with you,&rdquo; said little Lauren as she waved goodbye at the door, holding Jamie Lee&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;But I love my aunt Jamie more. I liked slapping you, Josie, and I love how you licked my pussy. Almost as good as with aunty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I liked it too, thought Josie. If I could do it again, I would. Oh well, not entirely hopeless.</p>
<p>Josie reflected that there never was a hooker mother. Just a scam involving aunt Jamie Lee and the little girl, a sort of pleading &rsquo;take my picture lady&rsquo; routine. No doubt other old and lonely women had fallen for that one, and Josie was just another victim. By the time she got dressed the pair had been long gone, and they probably hadn&rsquo;t even paid the hotel bill, either. High time, thought Josie with a sigh, to slip out myself before it gets too late. Go home and chalk this one up to misadventure.</p>
<p>The woman picked up her handbag and checked it. They&rsquo;d taken her money of course, but not her credit cards. Well, that was something.</p>
<p>But they hadn&rsquo;t found the small video camera hidden in the side of the bag, the one that had silently looked out on to the room and silently recorded everything in the room. The quality wouldn&rsquo;t be great, but it would be enough to enjoy when Josie masturbated in front of the computer.</p>
<p>Shame her still camera was gone, but there were a few more for her to take out with her when she went out taking photographs of castles and things. Going out with her handbag&rsquo;s secret movie camera so she could film innocent little girls at play. And it was surprising how many bored young kids there were at dusty old monuments, fed up with waiting around. Girls who would do cartwheels and maybe pull down their knickers for the kind old lady if no one was looking.</p>
<p>The end</p>
