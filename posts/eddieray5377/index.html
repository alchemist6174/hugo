  "articleBody": "I have always been attracted to young girls. Just ask my parents who were concerned when I had an eleven year old girlfriend at age forteen. Young girls are so sweet and innocent. Like every male who prefers young girls, the thought of a boyfriend named Bubba, has kept me from acting on my urge to sleep with girls under the age of consent. Given that I also have a grown daughter that keeps me in check if you know what I mean.\nMy son lives in a rural community about sixty miles from the closest city. I happened to be visiting him one afternoon, when his neighbor came to visit and brought her ten year old niece Emily, with her. She was tall, slender, sandy blonde hair with the prettiest jade green eyes I have ever seen. She just melted my heart and I knew I not only wanted her, but I had just to have her. My problem was how would I get to be alone with her for any length of time? The next day my sons neighbor became very ill and asked him to take her to the hospital. My sons neighbor was admitted, My son called me and asked if I would get Emily off the school bus and watch her until her Aunt was released in a day or so. I said sure since I did not have anything else to do and I was on vacation.\nEmily arrived and we had a decent afternoon, snacks, homework, the typical chit chat. How was your day? How was school? Activities, etc? After the evening meal we sat down to watch television. The night was cool and Emily stated she was cold. I took the blanket from the back of the couch and covered her with it. She snuggled up with me for additional warmth. Emily looked up at me and asked If I thought she was pretty? I looked at her and told her she was. She said not one boy thought so. I told her if I were forty years younger, I would be asking her out on a date. Emily snuggled tighter against me. I put my arm around her and placed it on her hip. She removed my hand and placed it on her small budding breast. She then pressed her chest against the palm of my hand. She then asked if I wanted to see her breast? I told her that I did, but I did not want to go to prison for a long time. She said she knew how to keep her mouth shut when she had a good thing; and proceeded to remove her tee shirt to reveal her budding breasts to me. Her next move really surprised me. Emily placed one of her breast into my mouth. I hungrily sucked them one at a time and she let out a soft moan.\nI released her breast from my mouth and started to kiss her soft lips. She started rubbing my body with her hands and I started to rub her hairless virgin pussy. I began messaging her slit and my Emily became aroused. I told her we should stop because we were going to start something that we may not get to finish. Emily stated that she wanted me from the time we met yesterday. Emily started kissing me again this time with all the passion that a little girl could give, but trying act like a grown woman. It was very erotic. I asked Emily if she were aware of the consequences of our action? She said yes. I asked her if she really wanted this, again she said yes. To emphasize her answer, Emily stripped off all her clothes and tossed them into the floor. I also took all my clothes off and threw them into the floor.\nI was shaking like a leaf in the wind. Never before had I ever thought about seducing a child, but then again the wrong head was doing the thinking for me.\nWe started kissing again and I picked her up and took her to the bed in the guest bedroom. As I placed her on the bed I went and retrieved a towel and placed it under her. Emily asked what the towel was for; and I explained that when girls have sex for the first time they normally bleed, and the towel was there to catch the blood. I started to kiss this little girl and began caressing her soft body. Emily let out a soft moan and placed her nipple in my mouth despite her small budding breast. I went back to her lips and started my way down her inexperienced body. I began rubbing her clitoris and her pussy lips. Emily started to squirm under my touch(puddy in my hands). I began to lick her pussy from her tiny ass to her clit. Emily started to fuck her pussy into my mouth, meanwhile I put my tongue into her virgin cunt. Emily started bucking and twisting. She screamed oooooooohhhhhhh myyyyyyyyy I am cummmmming. She laid there limp as an old dish rag spent from her orgasm. Oh she tasted delicious, I went up and kissed her again allowing her to taste her own juices.\nI told her to help guide my cock to her entrance. She started to rub my cock up and down her slit, and then plaed it at her entrance. I asked her if she was ready and she said yes. I slipped my cock in until I reached her maidenhood, I pulled out slightly and pushed past her hymen until I was resting on her deepest vaginal point. Emily screamed in pain as I pushed past her hymen and acted like she was trying to push my cock out. I rested until I felt her relax, then I started fucking her slowly. She started breathing heavier and she screamed as she had her second ever orgasm. Her jusices started flowing heavily and that was it and I started cumming more than I ever have my entire life. I sent my sperm deep into her cunt and her unprotected womb.\nI relaxed for a bit and then started to fuck my cock in and out of her no longer virginal pussy. She started to breath heavier again and Emily screamed out again as she had her third orgasm. I fucked her through three more orgasms before unleaching another large helping of hot fertile baby making sperm into her unprotected womb.\nWe fucked all night long and most of the next day. We fell asleep in each others arms with my rock hard cock in her in her tight pussy. Neither of us realized that she was fertile when I dumped eight helpings of baby making sperm into her body.\nShe told the doctor and the authorities she did not know who the father was. Nine months later she delivered twins, one each.\nI made arrangements for her to come live with me. We now enjoy each other on a nightly basis. Life is great, my eleven year old lover and I were married in Costa Rica three months after she came to live with me.\n",
