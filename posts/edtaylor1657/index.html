  "articleBody": "The clock says 2:37 am and I hear my newly adopted four year old daughter Penny crying in her room. After waking up from a dream of taking my first little virgin, my cock is rock hard. I get up and throw on a robe, more out of habit than propriety. Penny is curled up around that ratty doll she brought from China. I sit on the edge of the bed and put my hand on her hip. She flinches away from me, mumbling something in Chinese.\nI tell her “I love you,” which is basically true and stroke her back softly. Her crying quiets down. I pull her to me and she stiffens up in my arms, but I continue to stroke her gently and kiss the top of her head as she relaxes. Eventually, she falls asleep in my arms. When I start put her down and tuck her in, she grabs me and won’t let go. So, I climb into bed with her, shucking off my robe. I put her to bed last night after her bath naked, so I feel her tiny cute butt on my hard cock as we spoon in her double bed. She quickly falls asleep holding her doll as I spoon her from behind.\nI try to fall asleep, too, but my cock is wedged between her incredibly soft ass cheeks, which is quite distracting. I start to rub it up and down her silky smooth skin and it feels wonderful. I slide my hand down over her flat chest and massage her tiny nipples. As her tiny nipples harden under my fingers, Penny softly moans in her sleep. Her flat little chest really turns me on and soon I am close to cumming all over her ass. I slide my hand down between her legs and she is dripping wet. After lubricating my fingers with her ample juices, I rub her stiff little clit, making her moan louder. She starts to move her ass in rhythm with mine. Although I am not penetrating her, the sensation of her smooth ass cheeks on my cock is like hot silk. Her hands reach down under mine and she begins to play with herself, rubbing one hand on her clit and slipping one little finger of other hand slipping around her moon shaped hymen and up her dripping cunt. I move my hand up to her diamond hard nipples and pinch them, sending my little four year old daughter into a moaning vibrating orgasm. This sends me over the top, too, and I blow my load all over her tiny soft ass and back. Soon, my little darling is back asleep, holding my arm instead of her teddy bear, and I drift off, too.\nWhen I wake up, Penny is still asleep. My cock is kinda glued to her ass by dried cum from last night. Unsticking it is a little painful and wakes my new little girl up. After we take a piss, Penny doesn’t quite seem to know how the toilet works, so I show her how to flush it. She also puts her used toilet paper in the trash instead of the toilet.\nI wash her back and ass with a warm washcloth without getting too carried away. But when I wash my cock with her watching me naked, I get half hard. She seems fascinated and reaches over and touches it, running her hand up and down it, exploring. Her light touch quickly brings me to full staff. She leans over and gives it a close inspection, including fondling my balls, which always gets me going. She looks up at me and grins as she hefts a ball in each of her little hands. I grin back down at her. Then I hold her head with one hand and my cock in the other, and direct it to her mouth. She looks up at me and I nod, then she licks the head with her tongue. I muse that mine is not the first cock she must have licked. She grabs the shaft with both hands and sucks my cock into her hot little mouth. Her tongue licks the underside of my cock, making me moan. I hold her head with both hands and gently face fuck her, if that’s not a contradiction in terms. When I thrust too deep, my cock made her gag a little, so I ease up. Still, she’s able to take half my cock in her little mouth, and she keeps her hands around the remaining shaft. I take one of her tiny hands and put it on my balls and I’m in heaven as she gently fondles me. She looks up at me with a “Am I doing this right?” look on her face and I smile down at her. It doesn’t take me long to blow my load in her delicate mouth. She jumps back, spitting out my cock and I blow the rest all over her face and flat chest. She makes such a yucky face at the taste, I have to laugh, especially considering the mess I’ve made all over her pretty face.\nI grab the washcloth and wipe up my mess, then give my little girl a kiss. “You did very good, Penny,” I tell her, even if she doesn’t understand, “thank you.” I wipe off my wilting cock, and wrap us in our fluffy robes. I pick her up and kiss her again, and carry her into the kitchen. With her on one hip legs wrapped around me, I pull together some breakfast for the both of us. I sit her in a booster chair next to me and she watches me as use my fork on the eggs. She tries to copy me and gets most of the eggs in her mouth. I could get her some chopsticks, but I want to Americanize her as quickly as possible. She eagerly munches on bacon and toast with her hands as I do, but when she tries to eat her eggs with fingers, I gently slap her hand and hand her the fork. She frowns at me, but manages to finish her breakfast mostly hands free.\n…to be continued…\nI’ve been stuck in this story for some reason, so I am going to give it a rest. I may come back to it later.\n",
