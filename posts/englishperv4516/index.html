  "articleBody": "Things seemed to go in cycles with Sean. He’d have a few days of raw, primitive abuse of Hannah: unceremonious throat-fucking, anal penetration or extra-exhuberant arse-grinding, that kind of thing. Then he might go into a phase of more holistic type of adult love-making with her - even though she was not an adult, of course: things like vaginal penetration in an erotic clinch on a chair, and a lot of lusty mouth-kissing that he tried to train her subjugated little mind to reciprocate in. Then, sometimes, he’d go into a gentle phase with her, brought on by a touch of guilt -perhaps - or the pragmatic need to keep her ‘onside’ in her perpetual sex abuse. 4 months short of her tenth birthday still, his skills seemed to be working nicely, as it was doubtful she truly gasped he extent of the wrongs being done to her.\n“Come on, sweetie, let’s have a cuddle-up in bed,” he said to her this Saturday evening. Michelle, her turn-the-other-way mother was having a night out ‘with the girls’, and Sean assured her he was fine with being stuck home alone with Hannah.\nThe quiet and solemn-for-her-age little princess, sitting by him in front of the TV, said, “Okay.”\nSean’s heart skipped in anticipation, even though a ’no’ from her was never going to be an option. It always felt sweet to get her assent: a child’s obedience to an adult, just as things should be. He ushered her gently to the bedroom, his hand softly on the back of her head or the small of her back as they went. The simple act of walking alongside or behind her was arousing; the height-difference, emphasising the taboo nature of their ‘relationship’. He indicated HER bedroom as the venue this time. Once in there they stripped off, as if both were adults going through the regular motions. Indeed, Hannah probably had now ‘had sex’ more in her young life than some adult females ever would.\nSean gazed at her naked mini frame from various angles as she became nude, marvelling as always at the utter soft smoothhess of the flesh. Her torso was still devoid of any sign of puffies, but her butt, although small, had the perkiness and contours of a budding female. She climbed in and he, half erect already, followed her. It was going to be an intimate squeeze in her small narrow bed, amd Sean had to bend his legs a bit to avoid his feet hanging out the end. It was what he wanted, though; the eroticism of sharing a child’s bed, traditionally a place of innocence and cute sleep rather than sex.\n“Ahhhh, sweetie,” he sighed. He snuggled up, facing her, on their sides. He stroked the side of her head: the tender cheek and the exquisitely fine, soft brown hair. He kissed her forehead. “I do love you, you know.”\nThe ‘reminder’ was necessary, after the week they’d had. First it had been her anal impalement of his shaft in the armchair, followed by remoreseless mouth-fucking the next 2 days, before a repeat of buggery as deep as could be safely managed. On that last session, two days ago, she cried and protested. Knowing what was coming, she tried to run out of the room, before he calmed things down with some no-nonsense authority. Then he had his way up her child-rectum for the 2nd time in four days. It was a bit much, and now he wanted to be sweet to her.\n“Such a beautiful little face.” He caressed it, and pecked it. She smiled meekly, perhaps not as happy to be ‘beautiful’ as she once was. “There, there, let’s just cuddle.”\nHe pulled her head gently into his chest, and nuzzled his chin on her cute mousy head. His big thigh rested over her little hip, his boner pressing in her groin close to her cunt but not seeking it. She seemed quite relaxed, convinced by his tone that there would be no difficult violations today. When he looked down he could make out her precious, clear little eyes flitting around. Tonight, it was satisfying enough just to feel the power of ‘owning’ her, and further confusing her little soul about love/lust. For half an hour he chatted with her lazily, asking her such things as where she’d like to be taken this weekend. She said she’d like to do the bowling alley, maybe with a friend along, and Sean promised her it.\nWithout any particular announcement, he worked her onto her back, her head on the pillow. He propped himself over her for long and studious kissing. He built it up slowly, lapping and licking at her unblemished face-flesh at first before the inevitable Frenching. For a little while he had one hand clutching her chin and the other firmly gripping the top of her head as he locked on sideways. She simply submitted to it, accustomed to his smotherings but not exactly ’enjoying’ it in the way an adult might. Her mouth was pure, tender honey. It was endearing to hear how she took in little breaths through her nostrils if he did not let her come up for air.\nHis hard-on needed seeing to. “Hands on now, sweetie,” he said, gently. He guided her hand but she knew what he meant.\nHe continued the kissing and licking of Hannah’s child-mouth - sometimes even her nose and eyebrows too - while she slowly pulled on his rigid 6 inches. He uttered a string of loving encouragement to her all the way to his orgasm:\n“That’s it, you know how to do this, sweetie. Mmmm…” A kiss on her forehead.\n“Faster, just a little faster.” He breathed heavier over her cheeks, and nibbled at them.\n“Clever girl… ugh… that’s it…” He pecked at her soft pink lips in between his gasps.\n“Keep going now…” He had climbed above her, perched on his elbows, his knees astride her thin body.\n“That’s sooo good,” he panted. She knew to keep a tight hold as his hips rocked strongly back and forth.\n“Umphh, yess yess…” He accelerated into the final phase, and took her skull in his hands.\nHe had to hunch his body in order to mouth-kiss her at the moment of ejaculation. “Ummm, ummm!” He jiggled and convulsed as one strong jet spat out.\nHe broke off the kiss. “Ohhh, Hannah, yessss!” He grimaced as a second jet splattered somewhere over her middle, then his cock continued in a steady thin white drool.\n“Awww, good girl, you’re so good at this.” He rolled off her, sighing and smiling affectionately at her just as you should when a child has achieved something. Hannah smiled nicely, understanding she had given pleasure and put her adult carer in a good mood, if not understanding the appeal of the eroticism itself.\n“Let’s see,” said Sean. He lifted the sheet and observed that he had splashed around her upper thighs and some on her abdomen near her cunt. The smell drifted up. He made it obvious he was sniffing. “Nice, isn’t it?”\n“Uh huh,” said Hannah.\n“Come on, you,” he gushed warmly. He went onto his back and turned her onto the top of him. He pressed her cheek and torso snuggly down onto his chest and stroked her. He prompted her to draw her thighs up around his sides, and he pressed on her bum to bring her abdomen tightly into his.\n“Let’s just stay here and talk,” he whispered. He savoured the tender feel of her little thighs around him and his drying semen sticking their bodies together. He stroked her little buttocks and crack with one hand and traced the line of her delicate spine with the other.\nHe could rape or break the child on a whim, but feeling the power over her was pleasure enough. Eventually they both drifted off to sleep in this position.\nTHE END\nEmail the author. Any thoughts welcome.\n",
