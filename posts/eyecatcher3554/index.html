This is the story of a wonderful afternoon I enjoyed last year with my cousin Shelley and some of her friends.\nShelley was then 10, and we have grown up together almost as brother and sister. In fact, we have been closer than most brothers and sisters in many ways, not least because our families are nudists. Right from the beginning, then, ever since I helped change her nappies, we have been used to seeing every part of each other’s bodies and have no secrets from each other.\nThe best way to describe Shelley, I suppose, is ‘pert’, although in a nice way. She is about average height for her age, is slim, has dark eyes and dark straight shoulder-length hair and a long fringe. She is very confident, perhaps as I would like to think because as a nudist she has never had anything to hide. She has always treated me just like a big brother, except that she respects me a lot more than many girls do their older brothers, including my own sister!\nAnyway, a few days ago I was just finishing my lunch at home, with my girl-friend Lynn, when the telephone rang. My mother answered it and said it was for me. It was my Aunt Sue on the line. She had a problem and wondered if Lynn and I could help her.\nFirst of all, she had planned that day, a Saturday during the school holidays, to take Shelley and some of her friends to a sort of open day at the embassy in the city centre where she works. I would probably have gone with them if Lynn had not been with me. The friends’ parents had dropped them at her house and she had driven them into the city, only to find that there had been a bomb scare and the whole open day had had to be postponed.\nSo my aunt took them all home again, and they decided between them that the girls might as well stay there for the day, rather than call their parents to collect them at an inconvenient time. Then, just as she had been about to prepare lunch for them, her telephone rang. An elderly friend of hers had had a nasty fall, broken her hip, and was being taken to hospital in a pretty bad condition. The friend had called for my aunt, and she knew she had to go and see her immediately.\nHer problem was what to do with Shelley and her friends, who were all most disappointed to hear that they might have to be rushed back home.\nThen Shelley suggested that she asked Lynn and me to come over and look after them for the afternoon. So, Aunt Sue asked me, could we help her out, and right away?\nI had a quick word with Lynn, who was quite happy about that, and then told Aunt Sue we would be right over. We quickly flung on some clothes and hurried across, I on my own bicycle while Lynn borrowed my eight- year-old sister Jenny’s. Jenny was away on a camp at this time.\nIt was about two miles to Aunt Sue’s house, and it took us exactly ten minutes to get there from the time I put my phone down. We arrived to find Aunt Sue waiting in her car outside the gate, eager to be off.\n“Thanks very much, guys,” she called out as she drove away down the road.\nWe cycled inside, and I closed the electronic gates behind us. Then we cycled down the drive and round the corner of the house towards the back door. It was there that we ran into an ambush.\nI don’t think it was a deliberate ambush. Shelley and her friends had just been coming to meet us, and we met unexpectedly in that spot around the corner. As I cycled round the corner, with Lynn immediately behind me, Shelley flung herself at me, arms outstretched to wrap round my neck, shouting delightedly, “Roy!”\nI hadn’t been expecting it, and her ‘attack’ caught me off balance. I toppled over, still on the bicycle, with Shelley on top of me. As I landed on the ground, not really hurt but certainly startled, she rolled off and landed on her back just in front of me, laughing, with her knees up, giving me a wide view of her lovely white woolen panties under her short blue skirt.\nAlthough most of the time Shelley and I have been together we have both been naked, I’ve always shared an interest in her clothes, and she actually chatters away to me about her underwear very easily. No doubt when she feels ready for her first bra I will be the first to know, and she will probably ask my advice about what sort to get, too. I am not sure I want to go with her to buy it, though! Often when we are clothed she will show me what panties she is wearing, especially if she has a new pair. I have told her I like those woolen ones best, a rich white color with wide elastic hems and no lace. They feel so good, too; I can remember at times sitting with her on my lap and rubbing my hands gently on the material covering her soft little bottom while she smiles lovingly up into my face.\nAs a nudist I have never been curious about female anatomy, but I don’t feel I know a girl properly until I have seen her naked and seen what type of underwear she uses. It still gives me warmth and a thrill to feel I’ve been let in on something normally special and secret with the majority of the world’s population. With Lynn I was lucky, as I first met her on a nudist beach. But more of that later.\nAs I lay with my right leg under my bicycle, enjoying the view up Shelley’s skirt, I became aware of gales of laughter above me. The other five girls who were with her all seemed to think this was Christmas. I laughed too, and reached out my hand for Shelley, who scrambled to her knees and then threw herself, more successfully this time, into my arms, kissing me warmly on the cheek.\nLynn was behind me, still sitting on her bicycle and laughing too in her quiet way. Then I saw one of the other girls, whom I knew as Laureen, step over to her and whisper, more as a word of slightly shocked warning than anything else, “You know, your skirt is short; you show your panties when you have your leg up like that.”\nTo Lynn, this is about the most stupid thing that anyone can say. Lynn is actually Danish, where most of the beaches are wide open for nudists. When she is clothed, she likes to wear the shortest mini- skirts possible. She says this is the only type of clothing in which she can feel at all free, and it is only reluctantly that she bows to convention and wears panties underneath. I think she would actually be quite happy walking down the main street of town stark naked, she is so unconcerned. So showing her panties means nothing at all to her.\nShe actually wears very attractive, sexy panties, when she can be persuaded to wear them at all. They are a brilliant white color, but the front of the crotch is made of an almost transparent kind of frills. I remember the day after she first arrived, we went to the big city park and set there opposite each other and talked. She sat there cross-legged, quite unconcerned that she was displaying those exciting panties in all their glory. I was more concerned than she was, with so many other people walking around, and I was afraid of what they might be thinking about me, with such an exhibitionist girl-friend. I made the excuse that my back was sore and suggested we sat on a bench. She leaned back and relaxed with her knees about a foot apart, so that was no better. I quickly encouraged her to sit on my lap. She did so, and I put my arms round her with my hands resting gently between her thighs so as to cover her from public (or pubic!) exposure.\nAfter that, I got her to wear longer skirts when we went out, explaining that this country was much less liberated about female clothing than Denmark. Not that she had anything longer than mid-thigh.\nBut, with the hurry to get across to Aunt Sue’s house, I had forgotten to check that she put on a longer dress. These girls, coming from the slightly staid English school in the city, might think her exposure rude.\nLaureen’s warning to Lynn had about the same effect on her as it would had she said, “You are wearing a watch on your wrist.” Lynn just did not understand why it should be a problem. Then she remembered what I had told her, so she just smiled at Laureen and said, “It doesn’t matter.”\n“Roy might see,” I heard Laureen whisper. Obviously this girl didn’t know me at all.\nLynn looked quite bemused again. Then she said again, “It doesn’t matter. Roy doesn’t mind.” And she lifted her skirt up casually for a moment to show Laureen more of what she was wearing.\nI pretended I had heard nothing of this, as I responded to Shelley’s extravagant affection. Then, as if the last twenty seconds had not been enough, one of her friends spotted the little plastic dog I have on the handlebars of my bicycle. She squatted down on her haunches to have a closer look, giving me a clear view up her bright red skirt. She was wearing light blue panties, a couple of sizes too large, so I could see the sweet rounded curve of her bottom underneath as the leg openings hung down.\nThis was a girl I had not met before, but I soon learned that her name was Nicky. After I had gazed at her panties for a few seconds, I looked at the rest of her, and saw a real little beauty. This is the sort of girl you might see advertising soap or something in long-ago advertisements. She has wide blue eyes and her golden hair hangs down over her shoulders in natural curls. She has charming little dimples when she smiles and a lovely clear skin but, best of all, she seems completely unaware of her beauty.\nShelley pulled me to my feet and said, “You must meet my friends.” Most of them I knew by name, but little more. Shelley and I like to be alone together where we can enjoy our nudity without any intrusions, and as far as I knew girls at the English school were not into nudity. Now I know a little better. Besides, the English school is full of embassy children who move on every few years, while we live in the city permanently, so we have to get used to a quick turn-over of friends.\nThat difficulty has also drawn us closer together. Since I am in the senior school and Shelley in the junior, I don’t meet her friends at school.\nI saw that they all had soaking wet hair, so I knew they must have been swimming before lunch, and very recently. I wondered if they had been swimming naked, as our families do. Then I realized that probably they had, as they would not have had their swimming costumes with them. I wondered how they felt about that, now that they had tried it perhaps for the first time.\nShelley later told me that they had indeed been swimming naked, encouraged by Aunt Sue, who had herself been the first to strip off on this hot day and plunge into the pool. Some of the other girls, Shelley said, had been very reluctant to swim naked outdoors, but in the end they had all given in. As Lynn and I had been in the middle of our lunch, Aunt Sue had gone inside, still naked, to prepare lunch, and that’s when she had the telephone call about her friend. She came out to tell the girls, and that was when Shelley had made the suggestion that Lynn and I come over to look after them.\nAccording to Shelley, consternation broke out among her naked friends as Aunt Sue went indoors to phone us. Panic-stricken that I might be coming through the gate at any moment, they leapt out of the pool with one accord, scrambling for their clothes and pulling them on before they had even dried themselves. Shelley had not planned to dress at all, but her friends eventually persuaded her to do so. She took her time, and then walked with them round the back of the house towards the driveway to wait for us. Just at that moment, we had cycled round the corner into the ‘ambush’.\nShelley introduced her friends to me. Laureen was still standing next to Lynn, struck dumb by Lynn’s complete lack of inhibition about her underwear. Laureen is the tallest of the girls, slender but somehow elegant, with shoulder-length fair hair and a very wide row of teeth when she smiles - often a rather cheeky smile. She was wearing a white top and a bright orange and yellow skirt that swung down to her knees - but, as I was to find out, she could be quite careless with it.\nAll the girls, in fact, were wearing pretty dresses or skirts that day, having expected to go on a very special visit. My heart warmed as I took in their combined beauty. Young girls naked look most beautiful of all - as long as it is natural and uninhibited, not showing off. Next to that, I enjoy the beauty of their underwear or their skirts and dresses. I do not believe shorts or jeans look good on any girl; they make their bodies look misshapen instead of enhancing them. To me, it takes their sex away from them.\nLaureen I immediately felt a bit doubtful about. She looked to me as if she could be a little too precocious. I thought I would have to go carefully with her.\nI was introduced to Nicky, still crouching to look at my plastic dog, and a couple of the other girls bent over to look at it too. When they looked up again I was introduced to Angela and Rebecca.\nAngela is small, quiet and quite pretty, with light brown hair and wide blue eyes. She was wearing a sky-blue blouse and skirt, which matched her eyes perfectly. She looked at me almost out of the corners of her eyes and smiled slightly, without opening her lips, her cheeks showing a flush of pink as she did so. “This girl likes me,” I thought with some amusement. “She doesn’t want me to know, but she isn’t very clever at hiding her secret!”\nRebecca is very friendly and likeable. She has an English father and a Spanish mother, and I later heard she was the first of Shelley’s friends to swim naked that morning - due, no doubt, to the Spanish mother’s influence. Even today, the Europeans are much more relaxed about nudity than the British. She is an interesting chatterbox, and very enthusiastic about everything. She has dark brown hair, brown eyes and a slightly olive skin, but apart from that looks more English than Spanish. She was wearing a beautiful white blouse, looking rather Spanish with its frills around the shoulders, and a dark blue pleated skirt.\nWe all almost forgot the final girl in the group, standing at the back.\nThis was Tina, small, with light brown hair and blue eyes, and a rather pale face that I did not think very attractive. She was wearing a pale pink dress and hardly smiled or looked at me. She looked like a shy little mouse, and not a very happy one either.\nThen I introduced Lynn to the girls. She had now dismounted and was standing next to her bicycle, so she was not shocking the girls with her panties any longer, although I did see them glancing at her short skirt with rather mixed expressions on their faces. But they did take to her quickly and crowded round her, asking her about Denmark and sometimes causing her difficulty by talking so quickly it was hard for her to understand.\nAfter a couple of minutes Shelley reminded us that it was lunch time and I had been elected to prepare it for them. No, they did not know what they had been going to eat but were sure I could handle the situation. Shelley led the way into the house through the kitchen door.\nWe entered the house and trooped through to the kitchen. I was relieved to see a number of hamburgers and rolls laid out on the kitchen table; no doubt Aunt Sue had been just about to cook these in the microwave when the telephone rang. I found some margarine in the fridge and began to butter the rolls while the girls, forgetting me, plied Lynn with questions. I did say forgetting me, but Angela did not, every now and then shooting glances at me out of the corner of her eye and then blushing most attractively when she realized I had seen her. I encouraged her quietly with a smile.\n“How did you meet Roy?” Rebecca wanted to know. So Lynn told them the story, in rather hesitant English. I wasn’t sure the girls should hear all this, but Lynn was quite unconcerned.\nThe previous summer Lynn had gone with her family on holiday to a nudist beach in France, the famous Cap D’Agde, where they coated themselves in sun cream and spent most of their time lying in the sun.\nOne afternoon, the rest of the family - Lynn’s parents and her younger brother - decided to go to the nearby shopping centre. Lynn was quite happy to stay on the beach, so they left all their belongings with her while she lay on her back in a lounger and sunbathed.\nShe suddenly opened her eyes with a start, and had a very nasty shock.\nShe had felt a hand tickling her pubic hair. I should say that Lynn has quite a mat of hair downstairs, despite being only my age; in fact, she has more than I do. As I tell her, though, I need to keep mine cut rather short as in the hot weather thick hair becomes very itchy for me when I sweat, and in non-nudist places that is not considered an ideal place to scratch. Lynn’s is thick and light brown, though, so it is actually scarcely possible to see her vagina for it.\nShe looked up to see a stocky boy of about 15 with an ugly face and a half-erect penis leering at her. He spoke to her in French, which she barely understood, and she did not know what he was wanting, except that it was not pleasant. As he reached his hand out again, she cowered back and tried to call for help, but her voice stuck in her throat. Not that it might have done any good, as the beach was crowded, but nobody around seemed to be taking the slightest notice of this boy’s lechery and Lynn’s predicament.\nThe girls were greatly shocked by the story so far. They showed little surprise at the news that Lynn had been on a nudist beach, but then they had found out that morning, if they hadn’t known before, that Shelley’s family were nudists. But they gave little gasps of horror and fell deadly silent when Lynn told them how she had been touched in her most private place. I could see from the corner of my eye some of them shooting glances at me, obviously thinking that I shouldn’t be there to listen to this, but I kept my eyes firmly on the rolls I was buttering as if I hadn’t heard a word.\nThis is where I come into the story. I was walking along at that time, exploring the beach, as we also holiday there some years. Then I saw this lout with a stubby grizzly weapon sticking up between his legs, bending over a girl who at first glance appeared to be only about Shelley’s age. She looked quite terrified, and it was obvious that he was about to do something indecent to her and that there was nobody to stop him. Nobody except me, that is.\nI think it was the fact that Lynn’s apparent size reminded me of Shelley that suddenly filled me with anger; had anybody treated my little cousin in this way, I would certainly have been uncontrollably furious. I grabbed the older boy roughly by the shoulder. He swung round and moved back straight away, probably thinking it was the girl’s father come to rescue her. Then he saw it was only I, half a head shorter and perhaps two years younger than he, and he immediately became aggressive. He started swearing at me, but I cut him short.\nClenching my fists and very angry, I glared at him in fury. “Get out of this before I smash your face in!” I remember saying in a determined hiss.\nPeople nearby were now starting to take notice with the possibility of a fight looming, and I suspect it was this rather than any real fear of me that made him back off. I took a step towards him, fists clenched and ready to fight for my life should he try to land the first blow. He backed away as I repeated, “Get out! Just get out!”\nLooking flustered, he glanced at Lynn, still cowering at the far end of her lounger, and then back at me. I took another step towards him and repeated my demand. He spat at me, snarled in French, “I’ll be back!” then turned on his heel and stalked off with as much dignity as he could muster.\nI saw him off, and then turned to look at Lynn, softening as I did so.\nShe still looked like a little child, but I could see her rounded breasts and mat of pubic hair as she opened her legs to draw her knees under her. She had short fair hair and blue eyes with rather an intense look, and freckles on her cheeks. I did not think she was especially beautiful, and in honesty I still don’t. But she made me feel a man, and she has trusted me deeply from that day onward, and that is why I have loved her ever since.\nShe is indeed nearer Shelley’s height than my own, small and sweet, although only a month younger than I am. She looked as white as a sheet and was trembling all over. I found myself trembling as well from the shock of it all. I am not an aggressive sort of person and I was amazed to recall how I handled this incident. Had I not been so furious, I could not have done it.\nI made sure the lout continued on his way and then sat down gently on the far end of the lounger. I didn’t want to get any closer in case I frightened her any more. Lynn kept staring at me, as if turned to stone. I didn’t know whether she understood English or not; fortunately she knew enough for us to be able to talk to each other. “What did he do to you?” I asked.\nLynn said nothing for a moment, then looked along the beach at the disappearing back of the lout. Then she whispered, “He touch me - there,” and pointed between her legs. She looked back along the beach again, and suddenly scrambled along the lounger to sit right beside me, leaning against me. Slowly and gently I put my arm round her. She was stiff and trembling. Then suddenly the dam burst. She buried her face in her hands and burst into deep sobbing, her back heaving as she tried to suppress the sound.\nI just held her gently and waited. After about a minute the heaving settled down. Slowly she sat upright, still leaning against me, and turned to look at me with teary eyes. “You saved me,” she whispered.\n“Thank you.” She put her hands on my cheeks and planted a kiss on my mouth. I smiled at her and responded.\nAfter a short silence she looked up at me and said, in her Danish accent, “Please. Can you stay a time? Stay till my father comes.”\nI knew she was afraid of the lout returning, and so was I. Perhaps he had gone to fetch some of his friends. But I told myself that he was hardly likely to come back looking for a fight in a public place. I knew I couldn’t leave her until she knew she was safe. I hadn’t been going anywhere in particular, but was merely exploring along the beach after lunch while my parents and sister rested in the chalets.\nSo I stayed, and we talked. She kept looking over her shoulder, in the direction the lout had taken, so we turned round to face that way. But he didn’t return and we were both relieved that we never saw him again.\nWe had got to know each other quite well, with her still leaning against my shoulder and her hand on my knee, and me with my arm round her back, when she looked up and smiled for the first time. “My father and my mother,” she said.\nA tall man and a short woman, together with a boy of about twelve, were approaching and looking at me rather suspiciously, no doubt wondering what I was doing with my arm round their daughter. But Lynn stood up and broke out into a torrent of Danish, obviously telling them all about me. At first they looked angry, then concerned, and finally the parents looked towards me and smiled.\n“Thank you for being good to our daughter,” they said. They had brought some food back from the shops with them, and invited me to join them. I had already eaten, though, and Lynn didn’t feel like eating, so we didn’t eat much, but I was happy to stay and talk with them. Soon they were treating me like one of the family, and they were certainly very grateful to me.\nAfter a while I said I would like them to meet my own family, but I wasn’t sure where they would be. They would surely have finished their siesta by now, but I didn’t know where they would go after that. We had just arranged to meet back for the evening meal at seven o’clock. So I suggested I went and found them, then brought them to meet Lynn’s family. I asked if Lynn might like to come with me.\nThey all agreed, and her father said to me, “Buy an ice cream for you on the way. Please keep the change.” He handed me a massive currency bill that I couldn’t possibly spend all at once.\nI thought we would start looking for my family at our chalets. We had a quick dip in the sea, then trudged up the beach. On the way we passed a track where some teenagers on motorised scooters were skidding back and forth on the sand. We kept a sharp lookout for the thug, but he was not there. As we passed a large damp patch of sand just down from the showers, a scooter skidded in front of us. As the wheels failed to grip, it sprayed us with damp sand.\nWe were pretty annoyed, especially as the gentleman responsible scooted off without even an apology. As we were already wet from the sea, a lot of the sand stuck to our faces and bodies.\n“Don’t worry, we can wash it off in the showers at our chalet,” I said.\nWithin a minute we were there, but my family was not. I had the key to the chalet I shared with Jenny, my sister, in a small bag I had been carrying around with me, so I opened the door to let us in.\nIt was very hot inside, and Lynn gasped with the heat. Nothing would feel better now than a cold shower, so we headed for the bathroom at the back. Lynn decided she needed to use the toilet, showing no shyness as she sat down and urinated while I turned on the shower right in front of her.\nI stepped into the shower and was washing off when Lynn finished. It felt great! I reached out a hand and gently pulled her into the shower with me. It was a small cubicle, intended only for one person, so we had to stand pressed right up against each other. That felt even better, with the cold water streaming down on us and our naked bodies in close contact. I put my arms around her while she nestled her head against my shoulder blade. I kissed her gently and shivered as I could feel her pubic hair against my penis. Only the coldness of the water prevented me from getting a hard-on.\nI don’t know how long we stayed like that, but eventually the water began to splutter and dry up. I turned off the tap, reached for the towels and threw them over the nearer of the two beds, my own. Then I flung myself on top, on my back, and stretched out my arms for Lynn.\n“Come!” I urged her.\nShe looked at me with rather mixed emotions, presumably wondering if I was intending to have sex with her and afraid of it. I smiled gently up at her. “Let me promise you,” I said. “I will never, ever do anything to you that you don’t want me to.” And I have kept that promise. Not only with Lynn, but with all girls. I get what I want in the end, the nice way!\nShyly she lowered herself between my arms, to lie on my chest. Our faces, cold from the shower, were cheek by cheek to each other, and hers was so lovely and soft. I could feel her little breasts against my chest and her heart thumping rapidly through them. A year later, they had grown quite a bit. Again I could feel her soft pubic hair on my hip, and my penis started to respond, but I controlled my actions. We just lay there for a long, long time, whispering to each other and fondling, with myself careful to make sure she was happy with what I was doing.\nI had never stroked a girl in her private area before, but Lynn seemed to want me to do it, perhaps to make up for the way in which the lout had abused her there earlier on. I was very gentle, just enjoying the soft furry feel of her as she lay on her back across my chest and closed her eyes, a dreamy smile playing across her face. Occasionally she shuddered and then laughed, obviously with happiness. It must have had a healing effect on her.\nI’m glad Lynn didn’t tell Shelley and her friends about this part. I’m glad she didn’t tell her parents, either, as they might have changed their opinion of me and our lives would have been different. In the end we found my parents walking on the beach, and introduced them to Lynn’s parents. They got on well, and the end result was that this year, at my parents’ invitation, they arranged for Lynn to fly over and spend a month of her summer holidays with us, the official reason being so that we could help her speak English better!\nI had been so long without her, and it was great to discover that she was as happy to see me again as I was to see her. We had kept in touch by letter, and she wrote some very long ones, but it wasn’t the same.\nWhen we met her at the airport, she just ran up and flung her arms round my neck, kissing me so lovingly and wetting my face with her tears. Shelley, who was with me, was rather jealous, and when Lynn finally let go she piled on me for her turn.\nIt was a great feeling to be so loved by two girls, although in different ways, as I always counted Shelley as family. Now, as I stood in the kitchen listening to Lynn speaking of me as a hero and seeing from the corner of my eye Shelley’s friends gazing at me in admiration, I told myself that I would have a few more before very much longer.\nChapter 2 “You were so brave, Roy,” said Nicky, smiling up at me after Lynn had finished her story of how we had met.\nAll the girls were gazing at me in admiration and I was feeling rather embarrassed. “Well, there are some things you have to do,” I said rather awkwardly. “I’m just glad I was there at the right time.”\nShelley rescued me from my awkwardness with her suggestion. She stood in front of me with her chest out and hands folded together in front of her, her usual pose. “Roy, may I show them that photograph of you and me?” she asked.\n“Yes, fine,” I agreed. I knew which one she meant. Aunt Sue kept several photo albums, many of them showing the family unclothed, and in the front of one was a brilliant large photograph of Shelley and me, side by side, arms round each other and wearing only our smiles. It was Shelley’s favorite, and she wanted to have it framed and put on display in their lounge, but Aunt Sue said that some visitors might be offended by it.\nShelley came straight back from the lounge with the photo album and opened it up for the girls, who crowded round to have a look. It would be interesting, I thought, to see what effect it would have on these non-nudist girls.\nSure enough, as they saw the photo - or rather, the part of the photo containing me - they gasped, took a step back and their hands flew to their faces. No doubt they had seen smaller boys naked, or family members, but in the rather old-fashioned English school we all attended in the city, there would be no chance of any nakedness between sexes.\nI have always been rather glad I have a normal penis, although had I been more like Lynn it would probably not have bothered me at all what sort of equipment I possessed. Nudists seem to accept each other, even if there are peculiarities in the genital area. Non-nudists seem to pick up differences. Too small, and they giggle. Too large, and you hear exclamations of “Gross!” In this case, they were just startled at seeing a nude picture of me when they had not expected it.\nI often wonder what girls like these would have said had they had the chance to see Pete of the school senior football team in the changing rooms. He is 17, not very tall, but he has a penis that hangs down most of the way to his knees. Nudists like myself don’t worry about things like that, but others make comments, such as the one usually heard as he makes his way to the showers: “Careful you don’t trip over it, Pete!”\nWhen we go swimming, Pete has great difficulty in keeping it inside his swimming costume. Sometimes we can see the end sticking out at the top just below his belly button, and his friends warn him if there are girls around and make dirty comments if there are not. If he becomes aroused, no costume can hold it. I hate the stupidity of a world that makes an issue of things like that, and felt glad that Shelley’s friends had at least been educated a bit in the pool that morning.\nPete is very proud of his appendage, and in the school they still tell a story of what he did in the fourth grade. The class were doing practical measuring of their bodies in mathematics, using their rulers, and writing down such items as, “My foot is so-many centimeters long.”\nOne of Pete’s entries read, “My piss is 16 centimeters long.” It earned him a very painful interview with the headmaster.\nThe girls really seemed startled to see a naked photograph of me, and amazed that I didn’t mind. In fact, Laureen asked me, an expression of wonder on her face, “Don’t you mind us seeing you naked?”\n“Not at all; it doesn’t matter,” I replied casually, smiling and shrugging my shoulders.\n“Well, you’re not going to see me naked,” she replied defiantly, tossing her head back and swirling her skirt around.\n“No, that’s fine, I won’t,” I smiled. “We all have free choice in this place.” But I felt like saying, “Want a bet?”\nSome of the girls were still looking rather embarrassed by the photo, although Rebecca was paging through the album. Nicky obviously thought it was time to change the subject, as she turned to Shelley and asked, “Shelley, may we play with your dressing-up box?”\nShelley, perhaps rather strangely for a nudist, loves dressing up, and over the years she has gathered a large collection of clothes and costumes, helped in her hobby by Aunt Sue. She and her friends often play at dressing up when they visit her.\n“Yes, let’s,” agreed the others, all following Shelley out of the kitchen towards the front door. All the costumes were stored in a little playhouse in the front garden.\nAs they went, Rebecca turned back, stretched out a hand towards Lynn and said appealingly, “Lynn, come with us.”\nLynn looked at me, so I smiled and said, “Go and have a look while I prepare lunch; you’ll find it interesting.” She followed Rebecca out, leaving me alone to put the hamburgers into the microwave.\nOnce I had done that, I discovered that I was not actually quite alone after all. Glancing into the dining room, I saw the little Tina sitting there by herself, staring into space. That was rather puzzling behavior, I thought.\nWhile I was waiting, I wandered into the dining room and sat down at the end of the table, next to Tina. She hardly looked at me. “Are you feeling sick?” I asked gently after a pause.\nShe shook her head and continued to stare into space. I waited, but she said nothing more. So I asked, “Have you had a quarrel with the others?”\nAt this her face suddenly crumpled and tears began to run down her cheeks. She still said nothing, though, so I asked her, “Do you want to talk about it?”\nAgain she shook her head, and continued to cry quietly. “I want to go home,” was all she whispered. I moved my chair closer, stretched out my arm and put it on her far shoulder, with just a little gentle pressure to give her the chance to come to me or keep to herself as she chose.\nIt seemed to be the right thing to do, as she pushed herself off her chair and almost fell lightly into my arms, still crying.\nI pulled her up on to my lap; she was only small and light. She put an arm round my neck and cried into my shirt, the tears quickly soaking through to my chest. I held her gently and waited until she had finished crying.\nThen she looked at me and decided to explain. “We went for a swim this morning,” she said. “But we didn’t have our costumes.” She stopped and sniffed. I waited.\n“The others went swimming naked,” she went on after a pause. “But I didn’t want to do that. Angela and I didn’t.” She stopped and sniffed again.\n“The others all told us to go and join them,” she continued. “And then Angela went, but I don’t think she wanted to very much. I asked to borrow Shelley’s school costume. But they wouldn’t let me. They wouldn’t let me swim in my panties, either. They made me go in naked when I told them I didn’t want to.” The tears began to flow again.\nI shook my head silently. The problems it causes when children have been encouraged to be shy about their bodies! “But what about Aunt Sue - Shelley’s mum?” I asked. I couldn’t imagine her forcing anybody to swim naked, although she might encourage them.\n“She just told me not to be so wet,” whispered Tina, wiping away further tears.\nWell, I could imagine my aunt calling that out in her loud voice, but I was quite sure it was said with a big smile on her face and that she would not have meant to put too much pressure on little Tina. Tina must just have misunderstood her. I tried to tell Tina that, but she broke in and said, “All the others were shouting at me and they made me do it.”\nI wasn’t sure what had happened there, but I said in a firm voice, “Well, that was very wrong of them. I promise you that as long as I’m here, nobody will force you to do anything you don’t want to do. If they try, I’ll shut them up straight away. I promise you’ll be safe with me.” Looking down at her rather plain face, I felt a sudden rush of affection for this sad little girl, and felt all I wanted to do was to protect her, much as I had done about Lynn on that beach a year earlier.\nThis seemed to reassure her. She put her hands round my neck, looked at me properly for the first time and tried to smile. “Thank you,” she whispered.\nShe didn’t seem to want to move, so we just sat there in silence for maybe half a minute. The microwave had done its job, but I enjoyed the experience of a trusting little girl on my lap. I wouldn’t let her down. I think I must be a sucker for helpless females, but they give me so much in return.\nOutside I could hear the noise of the other girls as they played with the dressing-up clothes. Then Tina looked at me and said, “If we go swimming again, what should I do?”\n“That’s for you to choose completely,” I said. “If you want to wear Shelley’s costume or swim in your panties, or not swim at all, you do it, and I won’t let anybody even talk to you about it.”\n“I mean, do you think I should swim naked?” she asked me.\nI felt surprised, as it seemed as if she was coming round to the idea now. I answered, “Well, I think it would be a good idea to join in with your friends if they all swim naked, but that’s completely up to you.\nBut I don’t think they’ll want to swim naked with me here.”\nTina looked thoughtful and then asked, “Will you swim naked?”\n“I’d like to do that,” I replied. “But I don’t know whether I will, because it might make some of the others feel bad.”\nTina smiled again and said, “You’re very kind.” After a few seconds she said, “Lunch should be ready now.” She slipped off my knee and said, “Come and see what the others are doing first.” She took my hand and led me through the lounge to the front door.\nIt was quite noisy outside as the girls were excitedly playing at dressing up. The playhouse was much too small for them all to change inside, so they had spread the masses of clothes out on the grass under the tree next to it. The garden was completely hedged round, so nobody from outside could see them, otherwise they would surely have found somewhere else to change.\nAs I came out of the front door with Tina holding my hand, I could see girls in various stages of undress as they tried on the costumes. Lynn was down to her bra and panties, about to try on a long evening dress, perhaps almost for the first time in her life. I caught a glimpse of Laureen wearing her skirt but nothing on top, before she saw me come out and squealed, clutching her costume to her chest to cover it. This alerted the other girls, and Angela and Nicky, also half-dressed, covered up quickly and giggled.\nI knew the best way to act was to show I wasn’t interested and then leave them to dress again as soon as possible. So I just said, “Lunch is all ready, so do you want to come inside for it or shall I bring it outside?”\n“Outside,” I heard several voices say, including Shelley. I hadn’t noticed before as I was so used to it, but she was quite naked, about to try on a tiny bikini.\n“Right, I’ll bring it out in five minutes,” I said, turning to go back inside. Tina released my hand and went over to join the others with the clothes, which pleased me, as it meant she was joining in again.\nAs I went inside, I heard Shelley’s voice say, “Girls, we mustn’t wear these costumes during lunch because we mustn’t get them dirty or sticky.”\nI waited in the kitchen for five minutes, setting out the food and plates on a large tray, along with some plastic cups and a glass of lemonade. Then I went to the front door and called out, “May I come out now?” I knew the most important thing at this stage of my relationship with those girls was to show that I could be trusted to respect their privacy.\n“Yes,” came the voices in reply, so I walked out with the tray. The girls were all dressed in their usual clothes again, except for Shelley, who was still slipping her dress over her head. And there was Tina, standing there in rather worn, off-white panties, about to put her dress on, and it was clear that she wanted me to see her like this.\nIt was probably just her way of showing me her love and trust, and I wondered, after what she had said to me inside, if she would also be willing to let me see her swimming naked. Her little body was quite white and flat, apart from her ribs showing clearly.\n“Where shall we have it?” I asked the girls.\n“Let’s eat it in the tree house,” suggested Shelley.\nShe has a large tree in her front garden in which her father built her a tree house, but I didn’t think it would be large enough for all of us to have lunch together, and I said so.\n“Let’s try, anyway,” said Shelley, leading the way to the ladder. Still holding the tray, I followed them over to the ladder and stood at the bottom while they climbed, without realizing that they were giving me a lovely display of panties as they went up.\nFirst went Shelley, and to see those lovely white woolen panties while her short blue skirt rode up with every rung of the ladder she mounted warmed my heart, as it never fails to do. Then came Rebecca, silky white panties with little colored patterns across them; Nicky, with her loose pale-blue panties; and Tina, with her rather threadbare pair.\nI hadn’t seen Angela’s before: plain white cotton and attractive to my eyes. Lynn followed them up, and with her very short skirt I could see all the way up to her belly button very easily.\nLaureen didn’t follow them up. She explained to me rather pertly, “I’m not going to go up; there’s not enough room up there.” I wondered if she had guessed that I might have seen their panties. I later found out that she had another reason.\n“Please hold the tray for me, then,” I asked, handing it over to her.\nRather taken by surprise, she accepted it, and I climbed briskly up the ladder to the top.\nAs I expected, all the girls were squashed rather tightly inside and there was clearly not enough room to eat a meal. Tina was sitting on the far side, knees up and apart, pretending to be unaware of the fact that she was revealing her panties to me again. The others were sitting squashed up close together, cross-legged with their arms around each other, laughing. “I’ve got a splinter in my bottom,” announced Shelley.\n“I think we’ll just have to eat under the trees,” said Rebecca. So I led the way down again, with Rebecca’s skirt flapping attractively just above my head all the way. I was now close enough to see that the patterns on her panties were of little red and blue teddy bears.\nI was just taking the tray from Laureen when I heard a squeal and a bump behind me, and then squeals from the other girls. “Oh, sorry, Angela!” “Are you all right?” “Are you hurt?” “What happened, Angela?”\nTurning round, I saw Angela lying on her side at the bottom of the ladder, struggling to get up. The others helped her to her feet. There were tears in her eyes and she looked shaken, but didn’t cry. I could see that she was wearing some rather high-heeled shoes, probably from the costume box. They were hardly suitable for climbing, and she must have slipped and fallen from a couple of yards or more up the ladder.\nShelley led Angela over to me straight away. I put the tray down, knelt down and put my arm round her waist. She was too shocked to blush this time. “Where are you hurt?” I asked her gently.\nThe other girls were still all talking at once, so I only just heard her reply. “My wrist,” she whispered, holding a limp right wrist in front of my nose. A single tear trickled down her cheek. “I landed on my wrist.”\nI held her arm gently and told her to move her fingers, which she did.\n“It can’t be broken, so it’s probably just a bit bruised or strained,”\nI said. “It’ll probably stop hurting soon.” I smiled at her and rubbed her waist gently with my other arm, feeling the elastic waist of her panties under my fingers.\nAs I rose to my feet again, Shelley said to me, with a rather cheeky smile, “Roy, aren’t you going to kiss her better?”\n“Now why didn’t I think of that?” I reproached myself silently. It was an old family joke, and whenever Shelley hurt herself, or pretended to, it was my job to kiss her better. But I just said, “Well, if Angela wants me to.” I smiled down at her.\nAngela looked up, rather startled, and blushed a little as she so often did. I thought she was going to say “Yes,” but instead she whispered, “No.” I was just putting it down to shyness and turning away from her when she suddenly changed her mind and said, “Yes.”\nI knelt down next to her and laughed. “No - yes?” I teased her. “How do you expect me to know what you really mean?”\nAngela blushed again and then repeated, in the smallest whisper, “Yes.”\n“Very well,” I agreed, putting on a funny tone of voice to make her giggle. “Where would your ladyship like it?”\nShe turned her left cheek towards me and pointed with her finger to the middle. “There.”\nI planted a warm kiss on the exact spot and rose to my feet, smiling, as she broke into a beautiful smile and turned away to try and hide it.\n“There you are, it always works,” I told them all. Some of the others were looking a bit jealous, and some very surprised. As I got to know Angela better, I later realized that they were surprised that she should agree, because usually she is a girl who likes to play it cool and pretend she doesn’t have feelings. In that case, it’s a pity she hasn’t told her face about it, because it can be very expressive when she is taken by surprise or uncertain about things.\nI was about to pick up the tray again when Shelley said, “Roy, my bottom hurts. I got a splinter in it in the tree house.” She turned around, lifted her skirt and stuck out her panties at me. “There.” She pointed to the spot.\nI pulled the material down and had a look, but could see nothing sticking into her cute bottom. Then, when I examined the panties more carefully, I found a little splinter of wood that I pulled out and threw away.\n“Kiss better,” she instructed me, sticking her bare bottom out at me again. If we had been alone, I would have kissed the spot in fun, but I thought her friends might be shocked, or giggle in a silly way, especially Laureen, who I now knew could be very silly at times. So I just patted it and kissed her gently on the cheek.\nCarrying the tray again, I led the way towards my favorite tree near the swimming pool. For some reason, boys don’t seem able to sit cross- legged as easily as girls, and I liked this tree to lean back on. I put the tray down in front of me and the girls sat around. Tina sneaked in on one side of me, while Shelley claimed her place on the other side.\nThe other girls sat round in a circle, with Angela standing still for a moment before sitting almost opposite me. Again her face told its own story of an amusing mixture of feelings. Half of it said, “I wish I could sit next to Roy.” The other half said, “I don’t want the others to know I wish I could sit next to Roy!”\nThere was Lynn again, sitting carelessly cross-legged with her skirt up and open. Then my heart almost skipped a beat as Laureen sat down beside her. More careful than Lynn, she sat down opposite me, pushing her skirt down with her hand as she did so to make quite sure I couldn’t see beneath. She sat on a twig, though, and lifted her left thigh to remove it from underneath. As she did so, I had a momentary glimpse up her skirt, and for a split second saw a pink bulge between her legs, where her panties should have been. Laureen was not wearing any panties! So that was why she had not wanted to climb the ladder to the tree house! Had she lost them or deliberately left them off that day?\nOf course I said nothing, but Laureen seemed to stay very conscious of her vulnerability and kept her skirt firmly down over her ankles. I kept watching her out of the corner of my eye. She leaned forward to take a hamburger, reaching out with her right hand while her left remained over her skirt. Then she did the same with the lemonade. I felt sad for her. Nudists do not have to worry about that sort of thing at all, but these girls did not have that freedom.\nWe sat and talked while we ate, although Lynn and I just shared a small hamburger, having eaten one lunch already. Most of the conversation was about the clothes box, and the girls were keen to spend some more time there after the meal.\nIn the middle of lunch, Rebecca suddenly farted, not very loudly. She said, “Excuse me,” and didn’t seem embarrassed by it - the Spanish upbringing again, I should think - but some of the other girls giggled, especially Laureen.\n“Come on, giggling is silly,” I told them, trying to look suitably disgusted by their behavior. “That sort of thing doesn’t matter.”\n“‘It doesn’t matter,’” Laureen mimicked me. “Nothing matters? Doesn’t anything matter, Roy?” She looked at me with a challenging smile.\n“Not about people’s bodies,” I answered, rather sternly, trying to put to best effect my superior age and my position as being in charge of them all. “Suppose it was you who farted, or suppose a boy saw your panties or saw you naked or going to the toilet, or something like that. Do you want him to think it doesn’t matter, or that it does matter?”\nLaureen, no doubt thinking of her own pantiless situation, went rather red, looked down hard at her hamburger, shrugged her shoulders and muttered, “That it doesn’t matter, I suppose.”\n“Yes,” I agreed. “When I’m in charge, I won’t let anybody be rude about things that don’t matter.” I sounded like a teacher, I suppose, but I really believe that, even though when I say it I also hope secretly to soften them up so they won’t mind showing me those things they usually keep private. By acting casual and clamping down on anything that might cause embarrassment, I make them feel safe with me - and they truly are safe with me. As I said before, I will never do anything to a girl that she doesn’t want me to do. I just try to work patiently to make her want me to do it.\nSome of the rolls were rather crumbly, and as Laureen pushed the last piece into her mouth it fell apart. Since her lips were wet with lemonade, she had crumbs sticking all over her mouth. There were no napkins, of course, and she forgot herself for one glorious moment.\nWithout thinking she lifted the hem of her dress to wipe her mouth, and I had a ring-side view right from her bottom almost to her belly button. The soft pink lips of her vagina, spread apart to reveal deeper pink folds of flesh inside as she had her legs crossed, filled my gaze.\nI could make out no hair there yet, but had only a second to enjoy my good fortune before she suddenly remembered and pushed her skirt back down hard. She shot me a sharp glance to see if I had noticed anything, but I had already shifted my eyes elsewhere.\nMy heart was singing and my loins felt deliciously warm. The sight of naked girls does not particularly excite me in itself, although I find it a quiet pleasure and appreciate their naked beauty and their trust.\nBut getting a glimpse of the forbidden unexpectedly really turns me on.\nI felt very tender now towards Laureen, having seen her humanity, her vulnerability, and got away with it.\nOne amusing thing that happened during our lunch was that Nicky thought she saw a spider on a branch of the tree to my left, and threw a plastic cup at it. She missed by quite a long way, and there was a lot of giggling. As we got up after lunch, with Laureen pressing down on her skirt very firmly as she rose, I walked round the tree to fetch it.\nNearby something on the ground caught my eye. It looked like a piece of pink cloth. I picked it up, to discover it was a pair of pale pink panties, with neat lacing round the legs.\n“Oh, those are Laureen’s!” burst out Shelley. “She couldn’t find them when we were getting dressed after swimming this morning. Laureen!\nWe’ve found your panties!”\nLaureen came round the tree, looking a little red in the face, and almost snatched them from me, saying “Thanks” as she did so. I could tell she did not mean to be rude, but was feeling embarrassed. Nudists don’t worry about that sort of thing, but Laureen didn’t have the good fortune of that type of background. As she slipped them over her bare feet and pulled them up under her skirt, I smiled at her and said, “It’s all right; it doesn’t matter.”\nOnce she had her panties on again she seemed to recover her natural cheek. She was still a little red in the face, but she tried to smile back and said, “I put them in the tree when I went swimming and the wind must have blown them down. Then she added saucily, “I hope you didn’t see my pussy at all!”\nThe way she said it made it clear that she was sure that I hadn’t, although perhaps she was just trying to make certain. But I didn’t put her straight on that. I just smiled again, shrugged my shoulders and said, “Laureen, if I had, I promise you I would never think or say anything bad to you. To me, this sort of thing doesn’t matter. We’re nudists in our family and we don’t mind.”\nThen I walked over to collect the lunch tray, leaving her to think about it. I heard her muttering behind me, “Yes, it doesn’t matter.”\nChapter 3 Let’s play dressing up again,” I heard Rebecca call to the others as I carried the lunch tray into the house. I also went to the toilet, quite a relief as the excitement of Laureen’s panty episode had tightened up my bladder quite a bit. It was a sweet relief to feel the liquid bursting out of me. Then I went out to find the girls delving into the costumes.\nThis time they hardly took any notice of me as they undressed. They were getting used to me, and my casual remarks that ‘it doesn’t matter’ had made them feel safe with me. Laureen, standing there wearing only her recently recovered pink panties, looked at me, smiled rather precociously and tossed her head back, though she did have one arm placed a little protectively across her chest, her hand resting on her other shoulder.\nThen she bent down to pick up one of the costumes, and I caught a glimpse of a pretty little pointed breast, sticking up perhaps only two or three centimeters from her chest. As if she read my thoughts, she turned her head suddenly to glance at me, but I was quick enough to shift my eyes elsewhere.\n“Roy, come and dress up with us,” Tina encouraged me quietly, slipping off a vest with a couple of small holes in it. Her parents didn’t look after her terribly well, I thought.\nI hadn’t had much to do with Shelley’s costume box, but I did know that it contained mainly girls’ clothes. So I answered, “There aren’t any boys’ costumes there, and you won’t get me wearing one of those dresses!”\n“Shelley, aren’t there any boys’ costumes for Roy?” asked Angela, as if to bring my attention to her as she stood there wearing only her soft white panties. She seemed to have forgotten about the accident to her wrist.\nShelley was busy with Lynn, who had just slipped out of her mini-skirt, and I could see Shelley was eager to wear it. She turned round and said, “There are a few. I think there’s a pirate costume and a kilt.”\n“Is this the kilt?” asked Rebecca, holding up a piece of tartan clothing. Most of the costumes were kept in clear plastic bags so they would be kept clean but could still be identified.\nShelley nodded and grunted as she slipped on Lynn’s mini-skirt. She didn’t look too satisfied, though, as it was in fact about the length of her own dress. She was hoping for something really short. Lynn, for her part, had found a dress that Shelley used to wear about three years earlier, and was squeezing into it. A pale green color, it suited her well, except that it was even shorter than her own dress and her panties hung out of the bottom of it.\n“That kilt looks like a dress - are you going to wear it?” Laureen asked me, deliberately moving her hand just slightly so as to expose to me one of her little breasts.\n“I don’t mind wearing kilts,” I grinned. I stripped off down to my underpants - brief and plain white, as I prefer - and then put on the white shirt and fixed the kilt, complete with sporran, around by waist.\nLaureen, putting on a long, elegant pink dress, watched me dressing, while a couple of other girls were less obvious about it.\n“Now let’s see you dance a Highland fling,” suggested Nicky, just jokingly I think, when I had finished.\n“You had better make some Scottish music for me, then,” I grinned.\nLaureen immediately cupped her hands round her mouth and started trying to make noises like bagpipes, and the others joined in. It was about the worst display of bagpipes I had ever heard, but I knew what I had to do, and danced around like a true Scotsman, swirling my kilt around and even adding a somersault in the middle. They quickly grew tired of trying so badly to imitate the peculiar bagpipe noises, though. When they stopped, so did I, and I flung myself backwards on to the ground, then sat up with my arms round my knees and smiling at them while they clapped. I knew they could see my underpants under my kilt, but I was still showing them that ‘it doesn’t matter’.\nAngela came to me for inspection, wearing a beautiful bright yellow dress which flowed around her knees. The colour didn’t really suit her, but I smiled at her and told her she looked beautiful, which set her blushing so attractively again.\nThen Tina came up. She had put on a little ballet tutu over her panties, but the sides came up very high, exposing the panties right to the top so it looked rather silly. She seemed to think so, as she asked me, “Do you think it would be better to take my panties off?”\n“I think it would look better that way,” I answered, whereupon she pulled down the shoulder straps and started removing the tutu.\nLaureen, now wearing a nurse’s uniform and unable to mind her own business, came over and said to her, “Tina, let me show you how to take your panties off under your tutu.” Her idea, it seemed, was to pull one leg of the panties right down until she could take her foot out of it, and then easily pull the panties through the crotch of the tutu and down the other leg. She seemed most concerned that I should not see a girl naked, although obviously she knew I had done so with Shelley at least many times.\nBut Tina wasn’t having any of it. “No, I might tear them,” she protested, turning away from Laureen and towards me, and pulling the tutu down to her ankles before Laureen could reach her. Her panties came down at the back as she did so, exposing her little white bottom.\nLaureen sniffed and turned away, unwilling to associate herself with this distasteful event.\nI did my best to look unconcerned and uninterested as Tina removed her panties and stood naked before me, her little white body standing out in contrast to her thin brown arms and legs. Her tiny vagina on its little mound was hardly visible between her legs. I forced myself not to smile as I thought to myself, as I so often do, that little girls are the most beautiful creatures on earth. Tina took rather too long in straightening out her tutu, but then put her legs into it one by one and pulled it on. She looked at me rather timidly, perhaps a little afraid I might have some silly comment to make about her nudity, but I just smiled and said, “That looks much better. Are you going to do a dance for us now?”\nShe shook her head shyly, and then turned to Rebecca to show her.\nInside my heart was singing and my underpants felt swollen, warm and moist. I had won myself another conquest, another girl who trusted me enough to show me everything. Seeing Laureen accidentally reveal herself without her panties was a forbidden excitement, which is quite different from Tina’s open trust.\nThe girls were still trying on different costumes and Lynn’s mini-skirt was doing the rounds, but if they wanted the excitement of a very short skirt most of them were disappointed, as they were not tall enough. They were also admiring her panties, but were not yet confident enough with me to try those on in my presence.\nLaureen was the only girl taller than Lynn, and she eventually had her turn at the mini-skirt. Much of Laureen’s height was in her long legs, though, and the skirt just covered her underwear when she stood normally. Then she raised her arms and twirled around, revealing large expanses of pink panties while her friends giggled. Raising her arms, she swung her legs up in a hand-stand against a tree, and the dress of course flopped right down, even exposing her little breasts as she balanced upside-down. It seemed she was slowly becoming more confident in front of me, although she didn’t want to show it.\nLynn’s bra also aroused a lot of admiration. Seeing their interest, she took it off and gave it to Nicky to try on. Most of the girls were at this age just developing little bulges or points, apart from Tina, who was still completely flat. Laureen’s little breasts were perhaps the largest of them, but Nicky was also developing little points that added to her natural beauty, if anything. I enjoyed sitting there and watching her, wearing only those slightly over-sized pale blue panties, wrapping the bra around those cute little pointed breasts of hers while the other girls watched keenly and competed for their turn.\nIt is a strange thing about Lynn that, although she does not like wearing panties unless she has to, she is quite happy to wear a bra even when nobody would know if she didn’t. On this day she had actually been wearing a loose top with narrow shoulders, revealing large areas of white bra whenever she moved her arms. Not that this would ever bother her. She has strong breasts for her age, no points or unusual shapes, but just sticking out with straight profiles, broken by the nipples, in front of her.\n“Haven’t you any more costumes to wear, Roy?” asked Lynn, wearing only those revealing brief panties and smiling at me as I was still sitting on the ground watching them.\n“Yes, there’s a pirate costume and a Superman,” said Shelley.\n“Superman! I think he’s a Superman!” exclaimed Rebecca.\n“Come on, Roy, try the Superman,” Angela urged me, handing me the bag with the costume inside.\nAs I took it out, I saw that it was much too small for me. It was in three parts, with a cape and the black bottom part just like a swimming costume. It was supposed to meet the top part around the middle, but it was going to be difficult putting them on.\nStill, I would try. I took off the kilt and shirt, and put them back in their bag. Then I picked up the bottom part of the Superman costume and looked at it. It was going to be a tight fit. I slipped off my underpants to try.\nAgain Shelley’s friends didn’t quite know what to do. They had already been a little shocked by the naked photograph of me, but here I was undressing completely in front of them. Laureen couldn’t keep quiet.\nShe gave a giggle and announced, “We can see your carrot, you know.”\nI stood up straight and faced her, so they could see me clearly. “It’s called a penis, actually,” I told her. “And I don’t mind.”\n“Oh, Laureen, don’t be so silly,” Shelley snapped at her. “He’s right, it doesn’t matter. Why don’t you take your panties off too?”\n“He’s not going to see my pussy,” boasted Laureen. “That’s too private for boys.” Little did she know! But I suspected the fuss she was making was now largely an act.\nI put my feet into the Superman bottom and tried to pull them up. They came up past my knees and then grew tight around the thighs. They were too small to go over my bottom. I pulled them up at the front and back as far as they would go, but then got stuck. The top of my penis was still sticking stupidly out of the top and I could not get it inside.\nJust at that moment, I heard the telephone ring inside the house.\nShelley had gone into the playhouse for some reason, so I had to run and answer it. I heard giggling from Laureen, I think it was, as I disappeared inside rather painfully with the costume around my bottom.\nIt was Aunt Sue, just phoning to check that everything was all right. I stood by the phone, with the costume too tight for me to sit, and looked down at the top end of my trapped penis while she told me that her friend was in quite a bad way and she would not be back for some time. I should be ready for when the parents came to pick up the girls at five o’clock. She asked how we were getting on, and I told them we were playing dressing-up.\n“You haven’t got them in the pool yet, then,” she chuckled. “Poor little things, they were so nervous about nude bathing this morning!\nThey’ll be even worse with you there!”\nThe girls had now followed me in, with Rebecca holding Lynn’s bra around her tiny breasts, so I handed the phone over to Shelley and went outside again. Some of the girls followed me. “This is so tight it’s squashing my penis,” I explained with a laugh as I pulled off the costume. The tightness, continuing while I answered the phone, had made my penis swell and it was now standing almost straight out.\nThe girls looked at it in alarm, aware that it had changed its size and shape, so I quickly put on my underpants again. Then I fetched a deck chair from the playhouse and sat down in it, as Shelley came out of the house again. “That’s enough of costumes for me; there’s nothing my size,” I said. “I’ll just watch the rest of you.”\n“Let’s have a fashion parade wearing our costumes,” suggested Tina.\n“And Roy can be the audience.”\n“Yes, and he can judge us,” put in Rebecca. “Lynn, you must take part with us as well.”\n“We’ll call it the Miss Beautiful Costume competition,” Nicky decided for them all.\nThe girls thought this was a fine idea, so they looked around for their favorite costumes and change into them. Angela stopped a moment to whisper into my ear, “I think you’re very brave.” I was glad that my inelegant problem with the costume had not made me a laughing stock. It showed at least they respected me, except perhaps for Laureen.\nThey had just started when Shelley suddenly announced, “I need a wee.”\nSo saying, she whipped off her panties, stood up close to a nearby tree with her legs apart and let loose a stream of urine towards the tree.\nShe always prefers to relieve herself this way. When she was only about three or four she watched me urinating and was fascinated by the way I stood up to do it into the bowl, or against a tree if we were outside.\nI let her finger my penis, which she did very thoughtfully and said, “I wish girls had one of those.” But she seemed to decide from then on that if she couldn’t have a penis of her own, at least she could urinate standing up like a boy. As she grew taller, though, she found she could not urinate accurately enough into the bowl, and so whenever possible she would do it outside where there was space and she did not have to aim carefully.\nI remember that in her first year at school she got herself into a lot of trouble when she was caught urinating in the corner of the school playground - standing up, holding her panties in one hand and lifting her skirt high as she did so. At first I think they thought she was deliberately exposing herself, but fortunately her class teacher knew that she came from a nudist family and persuaded the headmaster to make allowances for her. But during the next couple of years I had to stop her several times from doing that in public, until she reluctantly learned for herself.\nMost of the other girls stopped dressing and watched her, with perhaps some amusement. They clearly knew that this was the way she often did it, and she had probably done it that way this morning while they were there. Laureen for one turned to look at me to see what interest I was taking in the display, but I didn’t show any. I still do find it interesting for Shelley to do this, but I have seen it many times. Once when Shelley was about five, when she was sitting on my lap, she lifted her arms to push back her hair and I tickled her under the armpits. She screamed with laughter and urinated all over my legs. Ever since then, I have told her I prefer her to use the tree, and it has become a family joke that she enjoys as much as anybody. I don’t know whether the trees are too happy about it, though.\nWith girls being the creatures they are, it took perhaps half an hour or more for them to find the clothes they wanted and to change into them. Some of them tried several before they finally made their choice, with Nicky being particularly unable to make up her mind. While I was waiting I marked out a stage in front of the verandah for them to walk up and down.\nEventually they were ready. I was to judge who was Miss Beautiful Costume, and it wasn’t going to be easy. They seemed strangely shy of going on stage first. Then Shelley said, “Lynn’s the oldest, so she must go first. We’ll go in age order.”\nLynn didn’t mind, so she stood by the side of the stage and the others worked out their positions in age order, which they knew pretty well, behind her. Shelley was at the back, as her birthday is right at the end of the school year. The judge sat there in his underpants waiting for a bunch of (in most cases) elegantly dressed girls. When they were ready, I called out, “Number one!” and Lynn marched on to the stage.\nI’m afraid I can’t say she was very good. First of all she had chosen that old dress of Shelley’s which was too tight for her and revealed her panties at the bottom. She had never had any interest in fashion parades, as was clear when she did her best to walk up and down, turn round and pose. After a few tries she walked off the side of the stage to a round of applause, came straight over to me and threw herself on to my lap, laughing. As she sat on my bare leg I could feel the sensual touch of her panties rubbing against it. I stroked them gently with my hand.\nRebecca appeared to be next in age order, and she obviously knew much more about modeling than Lynn did. She had found a brilliant Spanish dress with a full skirt, and she made a real meal of it, turning, posing, bending and stretching, with a lovely smile. There was a petticoat underneath which hung down a little, though, which spoilt the effect slightly. After mutters of “Hurry up!” from those in the line, she finished her act and came over to join us. She stood just next to me, smiling and leaning her arm on my shoulder.\nThe next in line was Nicky, who had eventually chosen an Indian sari.\nIt was a little tight, but it looked good. She also took quite a long time before joining us as well. She stood on the other side of me and put her arm on my other shoulder.\nThen came Laureen. She had decided to be a Hawaiian girl. She wore a grass skirt, through which her panties showed whenever she moved, but she didn’t seem to mind my seeing them now. On top she wore Lynn’s bra, which was too loose for her. When she came down, she sat cross-legged on the ground to one side of the rest of us.\nNext was Angela, wearing a beautiful old-fashioned bright sky-blue dress, almost the same color as the clothes she had arrived in. It was a little too tight for her, but it had a lace bodice at the top and the skirt came down in folds and layers, each with a lining of white frills. She looked delightful as she twirled most gracefully and the skirt swung gaily around her knees.\nAs Angela came down to join us, Lynn stood up and squeezed out of the little dress she was wearing. Clad only in my underpants, I had forgotten how hot it was, especially for those with tight clothes. Lynn sat down again, with those exciting panties pressed against the top of my thigh. Looking down, I could make out a darker mass through the crotch material that I knew was her mat of pubic hair. I smiled at her, and my penis fought against my underpants.\nTina was next. She was wearing the bikini, having changed into it quietly in front of me. Performing in public is not what she likes doing best, and she was quickly off the stage again.\nFinally came Shelley, now ready and eager to show off. She was wearing a Scottish costume which I think was supposed to go with the kilt. The little pleated skirt, too small for her, bounced up and down as she twirled, flashing those rich white panties all the time. I felt such a warmth in my stomach and loins as I watched her and felt Lynn. Shelley danced, throwing up her arms, kicking out her legs and spinning like a top. It seemed as if she would never stop, until the others started shouting at her, and she came off the stage panting for breath and smiling.\n“And now we go over to our judges, who will tell us who Miss Beautiful Costume is this year,” announced Laureen in a grand voice. All the girls looked towards me, smiling.\nI had been doing a lot of thinking, and found it very difficult. But in the end I had to make my choice. I stood up, hoping the shape of my underpants at the front did not look too obvious. Standing in front of the stage, I announced, “And our number three prize winner today is . .\n\" I paused for effect. “Shelley!”\nShelley gave a squeal, jumped rather inelegantly over to the stage and spun round twice, her skirt swinging up and revealing her panties again. “Shelley, it’s meant to be Miss Beautiful Costume, not Miss Beautiful Panties!” laughed Laureen.\nI went on, “Our number two prize winner is . . . Nicky!”\nWith a beaming smile Nicky came forward and stood in front of me in her sari while the others applauded.\n“And our grand winner!” I called out. “Miss . . . Beautiful . . .\nCostume . . . for this year . . . Angela!”\nAngela, in that lovely blue dress, broke into a beautiful big smile and her cheeks went pink again. She stepped gracefully forward and I pretended to present her with a prize. She blushed again as I lifted her off the ground and kissed her on the cheek, and then unexpectedly she returned the kiss, quick and wet, as I put her down.\nThe losers did not seem too disappointed, as I suppose they knew they were not quite as good as the winners. Laureen did ask me, though, pretending to look very sad, “What was wrong with my Hawaii costume?”\nI pointed to the problem. “Your bra is not big enough for you,” I grinned. Laureen and the others giggled, as they knew it was the other way round. Laureen, still pretending to be cross, pulled off the bra and threw it at Lynn, then broke into a grin.\n“Can we take the costumes off now?” asked Nicky, who was looking very sweaty. “We should have had a cooler competition in this weather.”\n“Yes, we should have a Miss Beautiful Panties competition, like Laureen said,” laughed Rebecca.\n“Ooh, that’s a good idea - let’s do that!” exclaimed Shelley, jumping up and down and deliberately flicking the front of her skirt up.\n“Shall we?” Nicky looked rather doubtful.\n“Yes, let’s! Come on, girls!” squealed Shelley, throwing off her costume. “Lynn’s ready for it already!”\nThe girls now began to look as if they were doing something a little naughty, as they took their costumes off and started examining their own panties to see if they had a chance of winning. Probably it would not have bothered them were they by themselves, but they were not quite used to me yet.\nAngela stood next to me, looked at me shyly and said, “Please help me.”\nI was a bit surprised, so I replied, “Help you how?”\n“Take my costume off,” she answered. “My wrist is sore again.”\nI wondered if it really was sore, as she had not seemed to have a problem putting it on, but I was only too eager to help. There was a row of tiny buttons down the front, which fitted quite tightly on her.\nI undid them carefully, feeling her chest and stomach pressing against my fingers as I dug them under the buttons. I spun her round to undo the sash at the back, and then gently slipped it down off her shoulders. She snuggled closer to me, pressing her bare chest against my arm. As I pried the bodice off her, I brushed the back of my fingers against one of her little nipples and could feel the soft tiny point. I moved my hands gently down her warm body, over her soft flat tummy, pulling the dress down slowly.\nThen I pulled it down to her ankles, revealing her soft white panties.\nAngela stepped out of it and smiled at me. “Thank you,” she whispered, blushing again. I thought she was going to kiss me, but she changed her mind. I put my arm round her naked waist, landing my hand on the side of her panties and gave her a gentle rub. The panties, as soft as they looked, moved under my hand and she smiled at me again, cheeks still glowing.\nThe other girls were by now lined up for the Miss Beautiful Panties competition. My heart warmed as I watched them, with their little bodies just beginning to show signs of womanhood. Laureen was standing there idly putting her thumb under the elastic waistband of her panties and flicking it out so it snapped back. Tina was standing with her hands down the back of her panties so I could see the sweet round curve of her bottom, perhaps because she had no pockets to put them in.\nShelley was dancing around gaily, calling out, “I’m first this time!”\nAs Angela joined them they formed a line, waiting to go. Somehow they seemed more excited about Beautiful Panties than they had about Beautiful Costumes. Perhaps most of them were enjoying a new freedom for the first time - and there was also the forbidden feeling of naughtiness, perhaps.\nShelley came first, strutting up and down, sticking her chest out and head back, one hand saucily on her hips and the other waving gaily in the air, turning, bending and then dancing. The rich whiteness of my favorite type of panties shone in contrast to her brown sun-tanned skin; I would have no problems in judging this competition. She really enjoyed herself again, and once more the others had to shout at her to persuade her to leave the stage. She leapt off the stage and on to my lap. I wrapped my arms round her and enjoyed the warm feel of those delicious panties.\nThen came Rebecca, with her white, slightly baggy panties with their little teddy bears. Again she put up a very elegant display, before coming off the stage and giving Shelley a nudge. “We take it in turns on this seat,” she told her. Shelley obediently slid off my lap and Rebecca, smiling confidently into my eyes, sat down with her legs over the side of the chair. I put my arms loosely around her, but carefully placed so I had a hand on her panties. They were cool, soft and thin to the touch.\nLaureen was on already, strutting around in her pink, which somehow suited her character. I guessed by now that all her smart talk in the past and her insistence that I would not see her naked had been an act, as she put on a very sensual display, curving her body smoothly and writhing as if she were in pain. At one stage she turned round and stuck out her bottom towards me, enabling me to see the crack up the middle very clearly through the thin pink material. She kept thumbing the elastic in the waist of her panties, pulling it out and letting it back again. Then she twirled around, put her thumbs in the sides of her panties and pulled one side down and back up again and then the other as she did a jig. I could see as she did it the smooth valley of her groin each side, but no further; she took good care not to show too much. She finished her show with a bow and a curtsey, curtseying not with a skirt for obvious reasons, but with her panties, pulling them out to the sides as far as they would go, and then letting the elastic snap back again.\nI wondered what she would do when she came off the stage. She had been aloof before, but now she came over and motioned to Rebecca, who obediently slid off my lap. Then Laureen jumped on, giving me her biggest smile, and I could see real warmth shining out of her eyes. I was winning with her! I put my arms round her again, and felt the soft fragility of those pink panties with my hand. Laureen put a hand down to help her find the position I wanted, right on top of my penis, and I’m sure not by accident. Then she settled back against me, and I gritted my teeth with pain. She was sitting right on top of my penis, which had become most excited by these developments and was gasping for more space for itself.\nI survived with difficulty, and had mixed feelings when the next act was short. Tina came on, very self-consciously again, and her panties were not very attractive, an almost grayish color and obviously rather worn. Her body was quite flat and her ribs showed through her chest clearly. Laureen did not look very pleased at having to leave her seat so soon. It looked as if all the girls had agreed privately that my lap was the seat for the most recent contestant. Tina smiled so sweetly into my eyes as she took her seat, and I smiled back and wrapped my arms warmly around her, forgetting at first where I always want my hand. Then I shifted my position, partly to give my penis some more room, and put my hand on the side of her panties. They felt a little rough, but there was a smooth skin underneath that I could also feel.\nNicky came on next, looking perhaps a little embarrassed that her pale blue panties were rather loose. She did not do much stretching but simply walked up and down, turning round a few times, and then came to take her place on my lap. I held her gently, noticing that her panties were actually patterned in squares separated by little ridges rather than colors. As I moved my hand, the loose material shifted under it.\nI pushed gently, and found a loop opening up at the back. By looking down behind her back as she faced the stage, I could see right down to her soft white bottom.\nAngela was already performing and I had to keep my eyes on her. Her white panties shone when she moved into the sunlight through the tree branches, and her face shone in a half-smile. She finished quickly, eager I suspected to claim a seat on my lap, but, just like her, she walked over very slowly, pretending not to care. She sat down with a pink-faced smile and leaned back against me. When nobody else was looking, she put her head back, gave me a light loving kiss on the cheek and turned away again, blushing. I gave her a squeeze and a rub with my hand, covering her panties on her left groin. I could feel the groove down there, soft and inviting.\nLynn was at the end of the line this time. Although I have seen her naked many times, I find her panties more sexually arousing than her nudity. As she walked and turned, I found my eyes fixed on those half- transparent frills around the crotch, clear enough to show something darker the far side. My body began to respond, and I shifted uncomfortably under Angela.\nLynn finished and came to take her seat, although she would not be able to stay there long. She smiled confidently at me, but I whispered to her, “I can’t possibly let you win, you know!” She grunted, smiling, and I knew she understood.\n“Come on, judge, who won?” called out Rebecca. I walked out slowly to the stage, trying to think. This time I had been so excited with the experience that I had forgotten that, but at least I only had second and third place to think of.\nI waited, smiling, for silence as I thought. Then I announced, “Our number three prize winner is . . . Rebecca!” I actually wanted to name Angela among the winners, but thought I had better not, as she had won last time. Smiling, Rebecca came to the front.\n“And number two . . . Laureen!” I called out. With her wide confident grin Laureen marched up to the stage and curtseyed to the audience again, pulling her panties wide at the side but remembering to pull the material back so that I couldn’t see down the front.\n“And finally, our Miss Beautiful Panties winner is . . .” I began. At that moment Shelley started strutting proudly out to the front, with a mischievous smirk on her face. Teasing her, I said, “Our Miss Beautiful Panties winner is Lynn!”\nShelley stopped and stared at me, her mouth dropping open in surprise.\nI burst out laughing and corrected myself, “No, it really is you, Shelley.”\nSmiling again, Shelley came up to receive her imaginary prize and a kiss. Then she turned to the others and said, “I knew all the time I would win because Roy says these are his favorite type of panties.” I wondered how many of the others would now be begging their mothers to buy the same sort. Angela for one, I could tell just by looking at her.\nFrom Miss Beautiful Costume to Miss Beautiful Panties . . . I wondered if the girls had any further beauty contests in mind. They did indeed.\nChapter 4 Shelley was not long in coming up with her next idea. “Let’s have one more competition,” she said, her eyes sparkling. “This one will be a Miss Beautiful Skin competition!”\nThe other girls looked uncomfortable. “What’s that?” asked Tina, although I’m sure she knew.\n“We do it in our skins!” explained Shelley, whipping off her panties and capering about. “Like this, naked!”\n“That would be a Miss Beautiful Boobs and Pussy competition,” said Laureen with a wicked grin. “You can do it if you like, but I won’t.”\n“Oh, Laureen, it’s very good fun when you try it,” Lynn encouraged her.\nSome of the other girls looked uncomfortable, though, and there were one or two glances in my direction. I thought I had better show no interest and go away for a short while in the hope that might help them to decide in favor. So I stood up and said, “I’m thirsty. I’ll go and get us some more lemonade.” Then I went into the house.\nI came out three or four minutes later carrying a tray of drinks, hoping that they might all by now be dressed (or rather undressed) for Miss Beautiful Skin. But they were still standing around in their panties. Shelley was stepping into hers again and saying, “Well, I think you’re just spoilsports. It doesn’t matter with Roy!” Lynn stayed quite naked, though.\nAs I held out the tray I said, “Shelley, if they’re not happy about it, it’s best not to do it. I don’t want anybody feeling bad. Let’s just keep to things that everybody agrees on.” I hoped this might have the opposite effect of encouraging them to take part after all, but they still didn’t look happy.\nShelley tried to argue while taking her plastic cup, but instead knocked it over, spilling the lemonade all down my front and soaking my underpants. “Ooh, sorry,” she exclaimed guiltily, as the others jumped back to keep dry.\n“Well, I’ll just have to be Mr. Beautiful Skin until these dry,” I laughed, putting the tray down and slipping out of my underpants. I rinsed them under the tap and left them in the sun to dry.\nThe girls had their drinks, obviously thinking about what to do next.\nI’m sure they wanted very much to swim in the roasting hot weather, but did not want to go in without their costumes. Probably someone would suggest swimming in their panties in a moment, and I would feel I ought to agree, though I was hoping for something a little less over-dressed.\nThen Rebecca, full of energy, shouted out, “Let’s play Catch!” She touched Shelley on the arm and scampered away. “You’re it!” she laughed.\nThe others joined in immediately, running away squealing as Shelley chased them. Then she came back and touched me as I stood still watching them. “You’re it!” she shouted.\nI was ready for that, and as she turned to run away I shot out a hand and touched her on the shoulder. She turned and touched me again, but I was again too quick for her, touching her back before she got away.\nAfter this had happened three or four times, she shouted out, “That’s not fair! You can’t do that when you’ve just been caught!”\nThe other girls seemed to agree, so I developed another plan to save my energy. As Shelley chased me, I ran behind Angela as she fled. I held out my hand for Shelley to touch behind me, and immediately passed on the touch to Angela, who was in front of me and under the new rules could not touch me in return. Angela caught Tina, who also started chasing me. This time I followed Shelley in the same way, and touched her as soon as Tina touched me. It must have looked a strange sight if anybody had been able to see us, a naked teenage boy running all over the place with little girls in panties.\nAll the girls to be caught seemed to want to catch me for a while until they found that I could be caught quite easily, but was always able to pass it on to another girl immediately. Then they lost interest and chased each other and Lynn, deciding I was no fun any more and leaving me.\nNicky was having a bit of a problem, though. Her panties were a couple of sizes too large for her, and when she ran they started slipping down. Several times I saw her hastily pulling them up over her cute white bottom, and when it was her turn to chase she had to run with one hand on her waist to hold them up. The other girls thought this was quite funny.\nThen the game took a new turn. Laureen was chasing, and she was after Nicky. Nicky found it difficult to run with one hand on her panties, and when Laureen caught her, she didn’t just touch her but grabbed her round the waist, pulling her panties down with her arms so that Nicky’s bare white bottom shone in the sunlight.\nNicky squealed and broke away, pulling them up again hastily. Laureen stood there laughing excitedly, but as she did so Shelley ran up behind her and mischievously pulled her panties down at the back too. Now it was Laureen’s turn to scream, as she pulled them up again quickly, shot a glance in my direction and then chased after Shelley. She quickly caught her and pulled down her panties too, only for Tina, of all people, to pull hers down at the back again.\nImmediately this was a new game. All the girls were chasing each other, trying to pull their panties down. Most of the pulls were from behind and just far enough to uncover the bottom. Then, as Angela tried to catch Laureen, Laureen put her arms out to grapple with her, only for Nicky to pull her panties down from behind so sharply that they sank to her knees and I caught a glimpse of her beautiful pink vagina again.\nThis time she knew it. She tried in vain to free her arms from Angela to pull them up again, but could not, so she fell forwards to the ground to cover herself, pulling Angela down with her.\nI was prepared to stop the fun immediately if any of them did not like it, but they were all screaming and laughing wickedly as they circled each other, trying to find an opening. Nicky was the easiest victim as her panties were so loose that they came down easily. She fell backwards to the ground, knees up and apart, as Rebecca tried to pull her panties down from behind, only for Shelley to nip in, grab Nicky’s panties round the crotch and pull them down almost to her knees. As she kicked, I caught a glimpse of a little slit reaching up between her legs. I watched with Lynn, a broad smile on my face, and counted to myself. Five girls apart from Lynn and Shelley, and I now had three out of five: Laureen, Tina and now Nicky. I felt rather like a heel for counting vaginas, but I was scoring only with my eyes and developing a real tenderness for their owners. It has that effect on me. I will never be a sexual molester because I feel so loving and protective towards the girls I get to see naked.\nAngela ran up to me to hide behind me, although no one was chasing her.\nI bent down and took hold of her panties around the waist, pretending I would pull them down. She squealed and caught hold of me round the waist, but didn’t try to stop me. But I couldn’t bring myself to do it.\nNot that I meant to - I expected her to squeal and struggle, but she acted as if she would have let me.\nThen again the game took a different turn. “Let’s get Nicky!” shouted Laureen, and all the girls seized hold of the unfortunate Nicky. I hurried over, ready to call a halt if necessary. But although Nicky was kicking and shouting, she was also laughing so hard that I saw no need to stop them. They had her on the ground, still kicking, and Laureen pulled her panties right down to her ankles, giving me another glorious view of this beautiful little girl’s most secret place - soft, pink and adorable.\nPerhaps Laureen thought that by selecting others to strip, she was taking attention away from herself. It was Shelley’s turn next, or so Laureen intended. “Quick, get Shelley!” Laureen shouted, making a grab for my cousin.\nBut Shelley broke away, and she had the answer to the situation.\nWhipping off her panties, she waved them above her head and shouted, “You can’t get me now!”\nAs Laureen came to a frustrated halt, Rebecca pulled at her panties from behind. Laureen turned on her, but Rebecca took her cue from Shelley, pulling off her own panties and dancing away. “Can’t get me either!” she gloated. Another beautiful sight for my eyes, and I just hoped that nobody was going to look in the direction of my penis for the time being. Four out of five I had seen now.\nThe fifth and last came immediately. Angela did not want to wait for Laureen to turn her attention to her. “Please take off my panties for me before they get me,” she asked, holding up her sore wrist to explain why she could not do it herself.\nThere was nothing I wanted to do more. Kneeling down, I turned her to face me. Then I placed my hands on the elastic top of her soft white panties and pulled down slowly and gently, savoring every moment. Down past the valleys of her groin which led down like a V I went, and then I could see the skin turn inwards at the very top of her vagina. I reached round the back to pull the panties down over her bottom, and then pulled down at the front to expose that delightful little vagina completely. I was in an excellent position to see even the almost invisible fair hairs lining it, still very short but one day to grow.\nShe had no visible mound to speak of, but the skin just curved smoothly downwards to disappear between her legs. I felt my penis jerk between my own legs as I pulled the panties down to her ankles. She put her hands on my shoulders and stepped out of them, as naked as the day she was born. I put my arm gently around her bare waist as she whispered her thanks and then turned to look at the others, arms round my neck.\nTina had long since removed her panties, and now the only one whose private place still lay hidden was Laureen. The others advanced on her, all still giggling at the naughtiness of it all. Laureen made a break for it, heading straight for me. I was still crouched down next to Angela as Laureen ran straight into my arms, shouting, “Save me, Roy!”\nThe others all gathered round, red-faced, panting for breath, stark naked and not ashamed of it for the present. They were not quite ready to seize Laureen as she clung on to me. “Pull her panties down, Roy!”\nShelley shouted.\n“I don’t do that sort of thing to girls unless I am invited,” I replied.\nLaureen was not about to invite me. She reached down, threw off her panties herself, tossed them in the air and ran. “Come for a swim!” she called back over her shoulder, and she leapt straight into the pool, naked.\nIt was most certainly time for swimming now. All of us, including Angela with her supposedly sore wrist, ran over to the pool and dived in. It is a shallow pool, with the water nowhere much more than a meter deep. It is also quite small, so the eight of us had very little room to ourselves. But the cold water did restore my penis to its usual size and shape.\nI dived in, and when I came up for air the person next to me was Laureen. She squealed and jumped at me, wrapping her arms round my neck and trying unsuccessfully to push me under the water. I could feel her little pointed breasts pushing softly against my chest. “This is fun!”\nshe exclaimed. I wrapped an arm round her as she tried to slither away and pulled her back to me. Most conveniently, my hand was placed over her left nipple, firm but yielding and with a little lump somewhere down underneath.\n“Who was it who wasn’t going to let me see her naked?” I teased her gently, nibbling at her ear.\n“I don’t really mind,” she told me, and then to prove what she said she pushed herself out of the water to sit on the side of the pool, opening her legs so I could enjoy another view of her vagina. “But I’d never let any other boy see my pussy. Or my boobs, even. Only you.”\nI felt honored. “I don’t know why not,” I smiled at her. “You have such a beautiful body.”\nSuddenly she went shy again, blushing, putting a hand down to cover her groin and slipping away into the water. But I could tell she was pleased.\nOne of the best things about swimming with girls is that under cover of the water they will allow me to do things to them that they would feel shy about above it. These girls came to wrestle with me and seemed to ignore the fact that my hands often came in contact with their wet little breasts and sometimes their vaginas. They would kiss me wetly, and often their legs brushed my penis.\nI was just putting Rebecca over my shoulder, enjoying the cold feel of her tight little bottom, when I heard a voice calling, “Catch me, Roy!”\nThere is a little slide at the far end of the pool and Shelley was sitting at the top, with her legs spread apart, ready to slide into me.\nI tipped Rebecca over my shoulder and held out my hands to catch her.\nShe whizzed right into me, landing on top of me with her legs around my chest.\nLaureen was already on her way to the slide, scrambling out of the pool on her elbows with her backside in the air and her vagina showing beneath it like a zip fastener. Others followed. Gaily they would scramble to the top of the slide, then sit down with their knees up and apart in front of me before sliding down into my arms. Lynn joined in as well, and came through the first time so fast that I actually got a mouthful of her pubic hair as her legs landed exactly on the top of my shoulders.\nLaureen now seemed to be taking a pride in giving me a magnificent view of her pussy, as she calls it, spreading her legs wide and sliding down on her back with her legs high in the air, shrieking with laughter. Her bottom hit me in the chest, and as I staggered backwards she flopped over on to her back, leaving her open vagina on her pubic mound sticking up inches in front of my nose. It took all my willpower not to kiss it. Not yet.\nFinally our energy began to run out. One by one the girls crawled out of the pool to lie in the shade, most of them flat on their backs pointing their hairless little vaginas to the sky. I was able to see that Laureen had some long hairs developing between her legs, but none of those little vaginas had yet been touched by the sort of thick hair Lynn had.\nTina, the barest of them all, crept close to Lynn and whispered to her, while pointing towards her pubic hair, “Will I look like that when I’m big?”\nLynn smiled and said in her Danish accent, “I am not very big, but maybe you will look like it.” Not that Tina ever looked likely to grow big, either. Lynn went on to explain how girls often look different as they grow older, some having more hair or a different color or shape of hair in their pubic area than others.\nThe young ones to me all look almost the same, when standing, at least.\nSome vaginas are smaller or shorter than others - Tina’s was very small, while Rebecca’s was perhaps the longest, followed by Laureen.\nSome open more easily than others when spread - it was easy to see right inside with Shelley and Laureen, while I glimpsed the shiny white of the membrane as Angela, knees up and legs apart, brushed some grass cuttings firmly aside from her vagina. Nicky, though, can sit cross- legged with the lips of her vagina still staying firmly together. Some have more of a mound than others. Tina and Angela were very flat, while Rebecca’s stood out clearly, the bulging lips turning inward to make a very exciting deep black valley.\nBut in ordinary positions there is very little difference, and when you have seen one, you have seen them all. I wouldn’t care a great deal if it was not for the occasional thrill, as with Laureen at lunchtime, of seeing something forbidden, or the trust shown by Tina, for example, the first of the five friends to give me the gift of a free view.\nThings like this give me real warmth that makes it all worth seeing.\nIf I do not found a girl attractive, I really don’t want to see any more. But these were all very attractive little girls, although younger than I, and their trusting nakedness brought a warmth and excitement to my loins.\nShelley was the last out of the pool. “I need the toilet again,” she announced, fingering her vagina for a moment. “I drank a lot and I almost did a wee in the pool.” She went over to the nearby tree, opened her legs wide and sprayed it with a stream of urine.\n“I wonder what it’s like pissing that way,” said Laureen, giggling and scrambling to her feet. She went over to Shelley, stood next to her and let loose. While Shelley thrust her vagina forward, though, Laureen was looking down at what she was doing, and the urine splashed straight downwards between her feet.\nMy penis now started jerking wildly, and I rolled over to try to hide it. The other girls all wanted to try it. Nicky, giggling, thrust her pretty little hips back and tried to reach the tree from two yards away, but landed well short. She put her fingers under her vagina to give it a push, and managed to reach a bit further.\nTina did not open her legs wide enough, and the urine dribbled all down her leg, causing her to squeal and look for some leaves to wipe herself. Rebecca managed in the same way as Shelley, pelvis forward and urinating steadily in a thick stream. Angela, like Laureen, was content to drop it straight down to the ground.\nI could hardly believe my eyes. This was about the most incredible sight I had ever seen. I often see girls naked, and some of them don’t mind me watching them relieve themselves, but not many older than five and certainly never a group of ten-year-olds. Over near the hedge Lynn, more conventionally, was squatting to do hers.\n“That’s how boys do it,” Shelley informed them all when they had finished. “I always do it that way when I can. But boys can do it further than I can. They can even do it upwards.”\n“Is that true, Roy?” Rebecca wanted to know.\n“Can you show us?” asked Laureen daringly.\nAfter all I had said about ‘it doesn’t matter’, I could hardly refuse.\nI stood up, aware that my penis was now pretty large and strong.\n“Sometimes it looks bigger than others,” commented Tina, looking at my penis, quite puzzled.\n“That’s because they use it for sex, silly,” Laureen told her bossily.\n“It gets big and hard so they can stick it in your wee,” added Nicky.\nTina looked shocked and obviously had not heard about the facts of life. “That must hurt!” she exclaimed.\n“It does the first time, but after that it’s not so bad,” declared Laureen, as if she had all the experience.\nTina looked bewildered. “But why do they put it in your wee?” she asked.\n“That’s how grown-ups make babies,” Rebecca explained patiently. “Stuff like wee goes through his wee into your body and sometimes a baby grows.” Obviously the word ‘wee’ in their vocabulary could at different times mean a penis, a vagina or urine.\n“Maybe Roy and Lynn can show us how it works,” suggested Laureen, with a slightly embarrassed smirk.\nI drew the line at that. “Oh, no, we’re not ready to make babies yet,”\nI said firmly, sitting down and hoping they had forgotten about my first demonstration.\nBut they hadn’t. “Roy, please show us how boys wee,” begged Laureen, pulling her face into a very attractive pleading look.\n“All right,” I agreed, turning to Shelley’s tree. Holding my penis in my right hand, I tried to urinate, but I was a bit self-conscious and it took several seconds before I could start.\nThe girls stared fascinated as I moved my penis around to send the spray up the trunk of the tree almost to my chest level by pushing hard, and a further distance across the ground than any of them could manage. “Gee, I can’t do it up there,” said Nicky in wonder. They were most interested to see how I could aim anywhere I wanted just by moving my penis, while they of course could do very little to control their stream.\n“In junior school I had a friend called Thomas,” I told them. “He could wee so hard that one day when we were in the toilets he wee’d right out of the toilet window. So we all shouted, ‘Hail to the rain-maker!’”\nThe girls giggled. “Did he get into trouble?” asked Tina.\n“None of the teachers found out,” I replied as my supply ran out. I shook my penis dry, which also caused some interest.\n“What shall we do now?” asked Angela once the show was over.\n“Miss Beautiful Skin!” shouted Shelley, jumping up and down.\n“Yes, let’s!” agreed Laureen, her eyes sparkling. What a change in less than an hour! Her expression still showed that she thought it was a very naughty thing to do, but now she was no longer worried about me it was very exciting as well. There was a chorus of agreement from the others, and they started off at a run towards the stage.\nLynn and I followed them, but I thought I had better say something before we started. I knew the parents, mostly diplomatic staff, were far more open-minded about nudity than the English school, but I didn’t want any trouble. “Listen,” I said to the girls. “Perhaps we shouldn’t do this. Some parents when you tell them might think we were doing something rude, and you might get into big trouble and cause trouble for me as well. Maybe we shouldn’t even have swum naked.”\n“Oh, that doesn’t matter, we just won’t tell them,” replied Laureen.\n“Will we, girls?”\n“No,” they all chorused, so I took it as safe. I settled down in my deck chair to watch the show.\nShelley insisted on being first again as it was her idea. As she went on, dancing around as usual and displaying her lovely little body so freely, I thought how different she and Lynn looked from the others.\nThose two had a lovely light tan all over their bodies from years of nakedness in the sun. Shelley was a little lighter where her school swimming costume fitted over her, as there were obviously times when she had to use a costume. But the difference was hardly noticeable.\nAs usual, Shelley had almost to be chased off the stage, after which she ran down to sit on my lap again. She put an arm round my neck, gave me a massive kiss and pressed her cheek against mine as Nicky tiptoed on to the stage. “I’m sorry, but I can’t let you win again, Shelley,” I whispered to her, getting a gentle groan in reply.\nNicky is a keen swimmer, but she obviously used her costume for it all the time. Her golden-brown tan came to an abrupt end where her school costume began, and her chest, back, tummy, loins and bottom were all a pale white. She was so pretty, but I felt a bit afraid that so much sun might harm such a white skin. She gracefully pointed her toes, danced and leapt. Without looking like a flirt, she managed to look dangerously seductive without even trying, and the other girls all stared at her as well.\nShe came down to take Shelley’s place on my lap, smiling at me with her wide hazel eyes and pulling her gently curling hair into place. Then, blushingly, she kissed my cheek. I returned it gently and she smiled back. What a beauty!\nAll Shelley’s other friends had bodies which showed clearly the marks of swimming costumes worn regularly, and large private areas which had never seen the light of sun before. Rebecca, the next, had three different hues to her body, as she obviously wore quite tiny bikinis regularly and her stomach and back were partly tanned. Rebecca too gave me a warm smile and a kiss as she settled down on my lap, and this was clearly now the unspoken rule.\nLaureen came and capered around seductively, but was perhaps a little too obvious in showing off her pretty little breasts, like new toys - which indeed they were. Despite the lack of flesh on her tummy, her bottom was perhaps a little too large. The other girls, I noticed, when they sat on my lap made sure they sat clear of my penis, still being a little uncomfortable with it, but Laureen again made sure she brushed it with her hand and then sat in such a way that it touched her bare thigh. Then she gave me a big sharp smacking kiss, giggled and turned to watch the stage.\nAngela was another very sweet entry, not quite so pink-faced as usual, but still very clearly out to impress me. I was entranced by her lovely smooth body all the way down from her little nipples to the soft, tender folds of skin between her legs. When she had finished she settled down very gently on my lap and gave me the cutest little kiss that I was naturally delighted to return.\nThen came Tina, and I was painfully aware that she was the only one not to have won a place yet in these competitions and afraid that it was hardly likely I could award her anything for this, as she always did everything so shyly. But all the same I gave her a big beaming smile as she stood at the front of the stage, waiting for my attention. Then slowly, gently, she walked, turned, jogged, stretched and danced a little. Suddenly she had found her confidence from somewhere and I was most impressed. Her little bony body was flat but somehow graceful, and I noticed that her bottom was so small and smooth that it hardly stuck out at all.\nLynn, at the end again, actually looked the least impressive of them all. She just doesn’t seem body-conscious at all and didn’t seem to know how to show it off to good effect. Still, I got my kiss before I stood up to announce the winners.\n“Third prize goes to . . . Angela!” Blushing fiercely now, Angela came up for her kiss and prize. She gave me a warm hug, accidentally pushing her side against my penis as she did so and quickly moving it away again.\n“Second prize goes to . . . Tina!” The girl herself, standing at the back, looked round with an open mouth in surprise, not expecting anything. Then she gave a big but shy smile and came forward. Ever so gently, I knelt down to give her a hug and a kiss, glad that I could honestly give her something for a good show.\n“And our Miss Beautiful Skin for this year is . . . Nicky!” I announced. There was warm applause, as for the others, but also some surprised murmuring. I couldn’t quite understand why, as Nicky in particular had moved and displayed herself perfectly. Smiling, Nicky came up and rested her cheek against my shoulder before giving me a long, loving hug and kiss.\nThen Laureen said, “Well, they were good, but we thought Lynn and Shelley would beat all the rest of us.”\nI felt surprised. “Why?” I asked.\n“Well, they are the same color all over,” explained Laureen. “The rest of us are all patchy because we always swim in our costumes when we go anywhere else.”\nI hadn’t consciously thought of that when judging. The others had seemed so attractive to me simply because of their pretty little white bodies where the sun had never ventured before. But I didn’t want to say so, in case it put them off nude swimming. So I thought quickly and then said, “Well, you know, I didn’t think it would be fair to count them in this competition. They have an unfair advantage, so I thought I wouldn’t count that.”\nThey seemed to accept what I said, and then Rebecca said, “I’m thirsty.\n“Please may we have some more lemonade?”\nI agreed and was just about to go inside when I looked at my watch, the only item of clothing I had been wearing. “It’s almost four o’clock now, and your parents are due in half an hour,” I said. “We had better be getting our clothes on in case any of them come early.”\n“Remember, don’t tell,” Laureen instructed the others.\n“May we have another swim first?” asked Angela. I gave them five minutes and then went inside.\nInside the kitchen I was pouring the lemonade when Tina, still naked, came in through the door. She smiled shyly as I looked at her and said, “Thank you for being so kind.”\nI crouched down and she walked into my arms, putting her head against my shoulder. I noticed that she smelt slightly of urine from where she had dribbled down her leg. I knelt with one knee up in front of me and one behind, and she straddled herself on the one in front, her tiny vagina pressing against the top of my thigh. We cuddled before she gave me a wet kiss and then ran out of the door for a swim, her flat little bottom wobbling as she did so.\nI brought out the drinks and called the girls, who drank and then we all changed back into our clothes, feeling a big sense of anti-climax.\nIt had been great, and all Shelley’s friends looked starry-eyed, as if they had just returned from the most wonderful show or display they had ever seen. “I wish we didn’t have to wear clothes,” I heard Nicky say as she put on her slightly large light blue panties again. “I’m sure my mum and dad will never let me be naked at home.”\n“Well, why don’t we start our own nudist club?” asked Shelley, her eyes sparkling. “We won’t tell anybody what it is, except my mum, and she won’t mind and she won’t tell. Let’s have our first meeting on Monday.”\n“Roy, can you come?” asked Laureen, and I was happy to see the note of pleading in her eyes. “And Lynn?”\n“I’m sure we can,” I answered. “You’ll need somebody to be in charge while Shelley’s mum is at work.”\n“And we’ll all wear mini-skirts to come in!” Shelley continued excitedly.\n“Oh, no, we won’t!” I broke in. “You’re not getting me in a mini- skirt!”\nThe girls laughed. “You can wear the kilt!” Rebecca suggested.\n“Or that Superman outfit!” giggled Laureen.\nAgain I felt excitement warming my loins. I was sure Monday would be even better, if possible.\nPart 5\nOn Monday morning Lynn and I set off for my Aunt Sue’s house bright and early before my aunt left for work. We had a slight problem on the way as we cycled over to her house.\nWe had just cycled out of the gate when I turned round to say something to Lynn, who was cycling behind me, and suddenly noticed what I should have noticed before. Lynn was wearing her usual very short mini-skirt, a green one this time, and as her legs pumped up and down I suddenly noticed, instead of her usual sexy white panties, her thick mat of curly light brown pubic hair. I stopped straight away.\n“Look, Lynn, for goodness’ sake go and put some panties on,” I urged her. “I don’t want everyone we meet on the road seeing up your skirt like that. You might cause some accidents. We don’t want anybody killing himself through watching you instead of the road.” (“What a way to go!” I thought to myself.) “They won’t do that. I don’t mind,” protested Lynn, shrugging her shoulders.\n“Well, I do mind,” I argued. It was not often we did argue. “You must go and put some panties on. And bring a hat or a jersey to keep on your lap while we’re cycling. It’s not good in this country to show your panties in public either.”\n“If you don’t want being seen with me, you go in front and I will come behind where nobody can see we are with each other - together,” Lynn replied.\n“No, that’s silly,” I told her. “You said you’d let me teach you the ways of this country when you came, so you must do as I say. Quickly!”\nLynn still argued, and I started to get angry, which upset her a bit.\nIn the end, she dropped the bicycle to the ground and went inside. She was out again in a minute, saying nothing, but lifting the front of her skirt to show me those white panties underneath, with the almost transparent frills at the crotch. I hoped nobody else was watching. She pushed her hat rather crossly down into the gap between her thighs and followed me as I cycled down the road.\nThis delayed us a bit, and Aunt Sue was waiting for us by the driveway.\nWe were still earlier to arrive than any of Shelley’s friends, though.\nShelley was there, wearing a little dark blue mini-skirt that just covered her panties - assuming that she was wearing any. She gave us both an excited hug and kiss, and then told us, “Rebecca and Tina can’t come. Rebecca’s going out and Tina’s got diarrhea. She did it in her panties at breakfast and she’s crying all the time because she wants to come.”\nI was very sorry to hear that. I had liked them both, especially that little Tina, so timid yet so loveable and in need of protection.\nPerhaps she had become too excited about this day. Shelley went on, “I’ve invited two more girls to take their places, though - Brenda and Sally.”\n“Did you tell them it’s a nudist club?” I asked.\n“Well, not exactly, because their mums might have heard or they might have told them,” explained Shelley. “I said it was a mini-skirt club and they must come wearing their mini-skirts.”\n“I don’t think that’s very fair,” Aunt Sue told Shelley. “You need to tell them beforehand what you are going to do. Many girls I’m sure would be most unhappy just to visit a friend and then find out they have to take their clothes off.”\n“They might be too shy to do that, especially with me here,” I put in.\nShelley looked crestfallen. “Well, they won’t have to if they don’t want to,” she answered. “But before long I know they’ll want to, like all the others did on Saturday. Here comes somebody.”\n“All the same, I think there must be no taking off of clothes unless everybody present agrees,” said Aunt Sue firmly, as the first car came down the driveway. “Roy, will you see to that?”\n“Yes, I will do,” I agreed, rather annoyed with Shelley. Her thoughtlessness could spoil the day.\nThe car stopped beside them and Laureen got out. On Saturday she had been wearing a flowing skirt down to her knees, but today she was wearing about the flimsiest mini-dress I have ever seen - apart from Lynn’s, of course. It was very broad, floating out around her body, barely covered her bottom and was made of black and orange floral material so thin that I could make out some very tiny panties underneath.\nHer mother called to Aunt Sue through the car window. “I hope they’re all going to stay out of the public view, considering the dress Laureen is wearing today!” she laughed. “She insisted that was the one she wanted.”\n“Yes, we’ll keep her on the property,” Aunt Sue assured her. This was clearly one of the more liberated mothers. Aunt Sue introduced Lynn and me to Laureen’s mother, reminding her that we had done ‘such a wonderful job of entertaining the girls on Saturday’. I smiled and used my best manners, knowing how important it was that the parents thought I was a suitable person to help look after their daughters.\nThe others started to arrive. Next was Angela, who looked up at me shyly, blushing a little as usual. She was wearing all white, a white blouse and a short white pleated tennis skirt. Again Aunt Sue introduced Lynn and me, as she did with all the parents.\nThen came the new girl Brenda, whom I hadn’t met before. Brenda is small and petite, with straight fair hair coming down in a ponytail behind her. She is very thin, though, rather like Tina, and I could very easily have clasped one hand round her upper arms if I had wanted.\nShe was wearing a light violet top and a short skirt in dark purple.\nShe looked rather quiet and shy of me. I wondered how she would feel when she found out she had joined a nudist club.\nNicky came next, looking as beautiful as ever, if a little too grown up, in a white top and short tight black skirt. As soon as her mother had driven out, she raised the front of the skirt to reveal bright white panties and said, “I was going to wear red panties today but I thought the colors wouldn’t match.” I was secretly pleased - red seems a very silly color for panties to me and it always seems to cause rude comment among boys if discovered.\n“Very nice, Nicky,” laughed Aunt Sue. “You know, when I was at school we all had to wear the ordinary school panties, the same color and pattern as the uniform. But some of us used to wear our own panties underneath, and we would go into the toilets at playtime and show each other what we had on. It was mostly white in those days, but some of us wore some very frilly things.”\nThe last to arrive was the other new girl, Sally. I immediately thought Sally looked about the untidiest girl I had ever seen, and very little has happened since really to change my mind. She was wearing a royal blue dress that hung straight down from her shoulders like a sack, without any waist. Her hair was quite long and rather curly, but looked more like a bush than anything else. She had a big smile and was clearly not shy of me or anybody else. Her mother who dropped her off looked untidy as well, although very cheerful. Sally was soon giggling and squealing away with Laureen, and I thought the two of them made a good pair.\nIn between the girls arriving, I had given Shelley an idea of what we should all start off doing this morning, with strict instructions to all the girls that had been here on Saturday that nudism was not even to be mentioned for half an hour at least, and even then they were to ask me for permission before they decided on anything. I repeated that I thought Shelley had been unfair to ask Brenda and Sally round without telling them it was a nudist club, although Sally did not look the sort who minded. Aunt Sue agreed, and after Sally had arrived she climbed into her car and drove off to work, leaving us alone for the morning.\nSally had never been to Shelley’s house before, so she demanded to see everything in the garden. We went around the front, and Sally immediately raced for the little climbing frame, swinging upside down from the top rail and laughing loudly.\n“You’ve got a hole in your panties,” Laureen sang out as Sally swung over the top. Through a two-inch hole in her pink frilly underwear we could see the middle of the crack in her bottom.\n“I know,” Sally laughed. “That’s so I can do a poo without taking my panties off!” And she burst into silly giggles. This girl, I thought, was something else.\n“Come on, Roy, let me tell Sally about our club,” Shelley whispered to me. “I’m sure she wouldn’t feel bad about it.”\n“Maybe, but Brenda might,” I whispered back. Brenda was standing at the back, looking rather out of place.\nThey continued their tour of the front garden and Sally exclaimed, “Oh, you didn’t tell me you have a pool! I didn’t bring my costume!”\nShelley began to say, “You don’t need . . .” but I gave her a hard nudge and she stopped.\n“But I can swim in my panties,” Sally continued happily. “I swim in my bare bum at home!”\nThis time Shelley forgot herself and burst out, “Oh, goody, so do we!\nThis is really a nudist club, you see, so . . .” Then she remembered, too late.\nI looked back quickly at Brenda, who was staring at them, looking startled. I glared at Shelley, who looked very crestfallen and guilty because she always tries to please me, and then said, “In this place everybody can just wear whatever they want when they swim - it doesn’t matter.”\n“I didn’t know; I didn’t bring my costume,” whispered Brenda.\n“That’s all right, you can borrow Shelley’s if you’re too shy to go without,” I said. “But we won’t swim just yet. We’ll finish the tour of the garden and then see what you want to do.”\nThe tour took quite a long time because the garden is about two acres in size and the back is an absolute jungle, apart from a small clearing outside the back door. When Shelley’s family first moved into that house three years ago, they decided it was too expensive a task to have it cleared and employ enough workers to keep it cleared, so they just allowed it to grow. The grass is long and thick, but they have never seen a snake there, so the worries they had at first have gone. There must be hundreds of trees in there, including fruit trees, some growing together to form thickets.\nSometimes Shelley and I, along with my nine-year-old sister Jenny who was on camp at the time of this story, play hide-and-seek there, but it isn’t a very popular game because it’s so difficult to find anybody. I think Shelley still suspects there are wild animals living there.\nHardly likely, but there are hundreds of birds.\nSally especially was fascinated by this jungle and suggested hide-and- seek right away. We told her how difficult it was to find anybody, but the other visitors were also keen so we agreed to play it later.\nWhen we got round to the front again, Shelley followed my next suggestion. “Miss Beautiful Mini-Skirt competition!” she announced.\nWe did it the same way that we had done on Saturday, with myself sitting in a deck chair as judge and using the area in front of the verandah as a stage. I took my shirt off as the first step of the day.\nShelley led the way in her dark blue mini-skirt, and I was relieved to see as she bent that she was indeed wearing panties, her usual rich white woolen ones that I like so much. As on the Saturday, she came down to sit on my lap and gave me a hug and a kiss when she finished, again taking a long time over her performance.\nSally, now she knew what to do, would not be stopped. She rushed on next and gave a fast and breathless performance in her blue shift, adding a handstand in the middle that collapsed and left me looking at those frilly, holey pink panties. When she finished, she leapt at me like an excited dog, jumping on my lap and giving me a tight hug round the neck and a wet kiss on my chin. Then she leaned back against my chest, and I could feel her hot little body as I held her.\nLaureen followed, and her tiny dress proved as flimsy as it looked.\nEvery time she stretched, it rode up and revealed large areas of white skin almost up to her belly button, as I’m sure she intended. She was no longer wearing the pink panties of Saturday but a very small pair of white briefs with purple stripes diagonally across them, just enough of it to cover her vagina and little more. Then she ran over, pushed Sally rather roughly out of the way and jumped on to my lap, giving me a hug, a kiss and a massive grin.\nNicky was next, with her short, tight black skirt. Her white panties flashed nicely under that skirt when she stretched or knelt, and when she turned round it was tight enough to see the outline of her panties before she even bent over. This time she wore a shiny white pair that looked as if they were made of silk, rather than the larger pale blue ones that had started such excitement on the Saturday. Then came Angela, her white pleated skirt flapping up, especially at the back.\nWhen she knelt down with one knee up, spreading her arms wide, I could see a little red heart on the panties just where the top of her vagina would be at the front.\nBrenda, it seemed, was not happy about going on by herself, so she went on with Lynn. Lynn was never likely to be a good example of modeling, although I did notice she was still wearing her panties as she moved. I was wondering what Brenda wore underneath, but she did not show anything. She just walked up and down, turning around once or twice.\nHowever her violet top and purple skirt looked very attractive and swung nicely as she walked.\nNow the show was over I had the winners to announce. Number three I named as Nicky, number two as Angela, and finally, “Miss Beautiful Mini-skirt today is . . . Brenda!” Looking surprised and rather nervous, Brenda came out to the front to collect her imaginary prize.\n“That’s a lovely skirt you’re wearing; you look so pretty,” I whispered to her, and she looked me in the eyes at last and gave a trembling smile.\n“But she hardly did anything,” complained Shelley.\n“We’re not judging on what people do, but on what people wear,” I explained. “This is Brenda’s first time on parade, so give her a chance.”\n“What was wrong with my mini-skirt?” Laureen wanted to know.\n“It’s supposed to be Miss Beautiful Mini-skirt, not Miss Beautiful Panties,” I grinned, remembering Laureen saying exactly the same thing to Shelley on Saturday.\n“Yes, let’s have another Beautiful Panties competition,” suggested Shelley eagerly.\n“Later on,” I said, knowing that Brenda at least was not ready for it.\n“We were going to play with the costumes first.” I thought that this would be a good way to prepare Brenda for it, as it had the other girls on Saturday.\nThe girls went opened the playhouse and dragged out the massive costume boxes, while I went inside for the first round of lemonade.\nAs I was pouring them in the kitchen, Laureen came in through the door with a big grin on her face. “Just come to say hello,” she said, and leapt into my arms, reaching up and holding on to me round the neck.\nI staggered back, taken by surprise, putting the jug down with difficulty. Then I put my hands under Laureen’s bottom to hold her up.\n“I hope you don’t mind me holding you like this,” I said.\n“Why?” she asked, burying her face in my shoulder.\n“Because your dress is so short I can feel your panties,” I explained.\nNot that there was much of the panties either, and my hands felt more of the side of her bottom.\n“That’s all right, you can feel as much as you like,” she told me. “I want you to.” I did so, rubbing my hands gently over her bottom as I held her. The pants were a little coarse, not in the same category as they had been on Saturday.\n“Have a look,” Laureen invited me, scrambling down, turning round, lifting her skirt at the back and sticking her bottom out. They were white with purple stripes running diagonally across them, what little there was of them. At the back they seemed to disappear into her crack and I could not think they were very comfortable.\nI gave her a gentle spank right in the middle, feeling the crack down the middle of her bottom as I did so. “Anything else you want me to feel and see while I’m at it?” I grinned.\n“Yes,” she smiled, pulling her panties down at the back and revealing her bottom. I had noticed before that it did stick out a bit.\n“Very well,” I said, rubbing my hands gently over her soft white flesh.\nWhen I was satisfied I asked, “Anything else?”\n“Yes,” she said, standing up and turning to face me. Her hands went up to the buttons on the front of her dress. Then suddenly she seemed to turn shy. She turned round, said, “I’ll show you later,” and went back outside to her friends.\nI brought the lemonade outside to find the girls again in various stages of undress. Laureen was ready for me, stark naked with the bikini in her hands, ready to put it on. Brenda, changed into a long green dress, gasped as I came out and placed her body in between myself and Laureen so I would not be able to see her naked, but I deliberately took no notice of either of them as I held the drinks for them to take.\n“Remember on Saturday when Shelley spilt the lemonade down your underpants,” Laureen reminded everyone with a giggle. She was now wearing the bikini.\n“Here’s the Superman costume, Roy,” said Nicky, wearing only her white panties. She brought it over. “Please put it on again,” she said with a giggle.\nOne stage at a time, I thought. “I’ll do that later,” I promised. “I haven’t tried on that pirate costume yet.”\nThey found it for me, so I stripped down to my underpants. At this stage I looked at Brenda and told her how nice she looked. She smiled with a bit of embarrassment to see me almost naked, but I knew that she would soon get over it as I showed I didn’t care. Then I put on the pirate suit. It was not very exciting, so I took it off again and found the kilt. Again the girls got me to do a Highland fling for them.\n“Now the Superman costume,” said Nicky firmly, handing it to me. I couldn’t very well back down now, as I was carefully training Brenda, who still had not changed out of her dress. The girls gathered round, and I suspected this would now become a regular club joke.\nI took off my underpants and, with a grin on my face, tried again to put on the bottom part. There were squeals of laughter as it got stuck again at the top of my legs and I could not get it over my penis.\n“Let us help you,” decided Laureen. “Come on, girls.” She reached out, put her thumb under the tight elastic of the bottoms and pulled. Some of the other girls gathered round to help. Laureen put her other hand in to help as well, pushing it against my penis as she did so. All the girls pulled upwards, but could not shift it, until the elastic suddenly broke.\nI could now pull them up more, just enough to cover my penis, and they were tight enough not to fall down. I glanced at Brenda and saw her watching with a stunned look on her face. As I put the top on, I saw her unbutton her dress and slip it off down her body, showing me for the first time her flimsy pale yellow panties.\nAfter some more dressing up, Angela called for another Miss Beautiful Costume competition, which we had, and was won by Laureen in an elegant evening gown. Then the call went up for Miss Beautiful Panties. I still wasn’t sure about Brenda but couldn’t hold the girls off any longer. I was ready to insist that Brenda stay out of it if she didn’t want to take part. I had by now replaced the Superman costume with my own underpants, as they were more comfortable. I was surprised to find myself enjoying more and more the interested glances and admiration the girls threw at my penis whenever I changed; as mine was the only one, it made me feel special.\nI told Shelley at the start that she could not be Miss Beautiful Panties again, as she was wearing the same sort of panties as she had done on the Saturday, but she would still be allowed to do her act.\nBrenda was quite happy now to join in with her little pale yellow panties pulled up high over her skinny tummy. Rebecca was unable to come and Laureen’s panties were not very good quality, so there would be some completely new winners this time. I gave it some thought.\nEventually I awarded it to Nicky, followed by Angela and then Sally, saying that apart from the hole she had a very admirable pair. Again I explained that I was not counting Lynn, although she had remembered to bring with her some very fine panties!\n“Excellent,” agreed Laureen, reaching out, grabbing hold of the hole in Sally’s panties and pulling downwards. Sally’s little white bottom flashed into view, and she squealed, turned round and tried to pull Laureen’s down. But Laureen was already pulling them off herself, and again my heart skipped a beat as I caught my first sight of the day of that adorable vagina. Laureen laughed loudly and danced away, waving her panties above her head.\n“That’s cheating!” shouted Sally, standing there with her bottom still exposed. A moment later Nicky had pulled the panties down further, and she then had to grab Sally’s arms as Sally tried to return the compliment. By now Sally’s panties were down by her knees but her back was to me.\n“Get Sally, everybody!” shouted Laureen, jumping on her friend and pulling the panties to her ankles. Sally whirled round, and I had my first view of her soft white vagina.\nShe was taking it in very good spirit, so I had not stopped the other girls, but Brenda was another matter. Lynn put an arm protectively around her, but Sally shouted, “Get Brenda now!” Brenda whimpered and clung to Lynn.\nI quickly stepped forward and shouted, “No, stop!” The girls took notice at once, so I put my hand on Brenda’s shoulder and just said, “This sort of game is only for those who want to play it, and Brenda doesn’t, so you must leave her.”\n“Nicky, then!” shouted Laureen, pulling at Nicky’s white panties.\nScreaming and laughing, Nicky was lifted off the ground and her panties removed while she struggled and kicked. Angela did not wait for her turn, but removed hers of her own accord. All naked now, they turned and ran for the pool.\n“Do you want to swim, Brenda?” asked Lynn.\n“Yes, but not . . . not naked,” whispered Brenda. “And if I use my panties someone may pull them off.”\n“Not while I’m there,” I promised her, but Lynn was already saying, “Why don’t you change into that bikini from the costumes? That should be safe.”\nBrenda nodded, but shot a glance at me, so I took off my underpants and followed the girls to the pool, careful not to look back. It was essential to win her trust. When I reached the pool, I quietly warned the girls to leave Brenda alone when she came.\nA few minutes later Brenda, wearing the bikini, and Lynn, wearing her smile and her skin, came over to the pool. Brenda had perhaps been coached by Lynn, because she stood at the side of the pool and shouted, “Look at me!” Some of them stopped and turned, and Brenda, smiling, called out, “I’m wearing the costume from the box.”\nLynn had been right. The girls had accepted it and some of them wondered why they hadn’t thought of that. As Brenda slid into the pool, Angela said, “I wish we could have a Miss Beautiful Bikini competition.”\n“Ooh, I think we can!” suddenly exclaimed Shelley. “Roy!” She swam over to me and whispered in my ear.\nI nodded and replied, “Well, we’ll see after the swim.”\nAfter the swim we all went to lie in the early morning sun, which was still not too hot. I lay on my back with my limp penis between my legs and gazed at the feminine beauty around me. Truly little naked girls are the most beautiful sight in the world, if only they all realized that.\nLaureen and Sally were wrestling and giggling together, and it was a feast for the eyes to watch their legs waving up and down, sometimes spread and sometimes straight. Angela lay next to me, and I admired the soft smooth curve all the way down from her tummy and the gentle folds of skin between her legs. Nicky was idly tickling her vagina with a stalk of grass, and giggling to herself and wriggling in a very exciting manner.\nThen Shelley came over and sat down between my legs, holding on to them and laying her head back on my tummy. I could feel my penis against her back, and hoped it was going to stay still. Angela also moved closer at that, resting her head on my chest.\nI looked around for Lynn and Brenda. They were sitting together behind me, to the left, talking quietly. Lynn had her left leg on the ground and her right knee up, showing a wonderful expanse in between. Then I suddenly noticed that Brenda had taken the bikini off and was now as naked as the rest of us. She was still rather uncomfortable with it, though, as she was sitting hunched up with her knees tightly drawn up and her chin on the top of them, but at the bottom by her heels I could just make out the lovely little bulge and the tail end of her vagina.\nShe was lovely! As I gazed on her, my heart felt very warm and protective towards her. She was now one of mine!\nAfter a few minutes Sally suddenly stood up and announced, “We’re now going to play hide-and-seek! Blocks!”\n“Blocks!” we all shouted.\nAccording to local rules at the English school, the last person to shout ‘Blocks’ is the one who has to catch or do whatever else nobody else really wants to do. Every time our family has a meal with Shelley’s family, even if it is a barbecue, Shelley always shouts at the end of the meal, “Blocks clearing the table!” Unfortunately for her, her family doesn’t play by English school rules and she usually has to lend a hand anyway.\nLynn was only vaguely aware of this ‘rule’, and so she was later than everyone else to call out “Blocks!”\n“Lynn, you’re It!” Sally told her. “You have to find us all. You have ten minutes on my watch to find us, and your score is the number of people you catch in that time. Girls, when you’re caught, come back to the pool. We’ll take it in turns to catch.”\n“Brenda, do you want to come with me?” asked Lynn kindly. When Brenda, still cuddling her knees tightly, nodded, Lynn said in her stilted English, “Brenda and I will catch together. We will stay with each other so that it is fair.”\nAll were agreed, so we put on our shoes as the ground would be rough at the back, but no other clothing. Lynn and Brenda turned towards a tree and began to count clearly, while the rest of us all took off down the side of the house for the massive back garden. Having played with Shelley at times, I knew the best places to hide and headed for my first place, plunging into the long grass. Then, when I turned round, I saw all the girls following me.\n“Come on, spread out,” I whispered to them. “There’s plenty of room here.”\n“I want to come with you,” Shelley whispered back.\n“So do I.” “And me,” came several voices.\nI laughed at them, and said, “Look, you can’t all come. That would spoil the game.”\n“We’ll take it in turns, then,” decided Nicky. “I bag first turn!”\n“No, I’m first,” argued Shelley, holding me tightly round the waist as though I were her own private property.\nAn argument began, and I had to break in and say, “Well, we’ll have to find some way to work this out. But Lynn and Brenda will be coming soon, so we haven’t time now.”\nThey were just beginning to come up with ideas when we heard dimly Lynn’s voice from the front garden: “Coming, ready or not!”\n“We’ll have to go back and start again while we sort this out,” I said.\nWe plunged back through the grass just in time to see Lynn and Brenda coming round the corner of the house. When Brenda saw me coming, she shyly put a hand down between her legs as cover and hung behind Lynn.\nI explained the situation to Lynn, and then Shelley explained to me how they were going to decide who came with me first. “We’ve all chosen a number between one and five,” she said. “Now you choose one of those numbers and the person whose number it is goes with you.”\n“I’ll take number five, then,” I decided.\n“Ooh, that’s me!” smiled Angela quietly, blushing as usual. “I’m first!”\n“Lucky thing,” said Laureen enviously.\n“You’ll all get your turn,” I grinned.\n“And Angela, you’re It when Lynn and Brenda have found everybody,” said Shelley.\nAgain we set off while Lynn and Brenda counted. This time all the girls spread out, looking for good hiding places, while Angela followed close behind me as I knew where we were going for our first place. It would be a tight fit, but we would be well hidden.\nChapter 6 I plowed through the long grass towards the very back of the garden, with Angela following me. I knew there was quite a large hole under a pile of logs in the far corner, and I was sure Lynn and Brenda would not be able to find us there.\nIt was not very easy scrambling through the jungle without the protection of clothes. I scraped my testicles climbing over a low branch, but gritted my teeth against the pain rather than let Angela know. We had to hurry, not knowing exactly how long it would be before the search began. Over to our right I could hear the low voices of the other girls as they looked for places to hide.\nAt last we arrived at the pile of logs in a small clearing. I bent down and showed Angela the small hole by the closest log. “In here,” I whispered.\nAngela looked at it with her gentle blue eyes, and then at me. “It’s not very big,” she whispered back.\n“It’s bigger inside,” I said, scrambling down through the gap. It was about three feet wide and three feet high. I sat at one side, knees under my chin and waited for Angela to scramble down.\nThere was not too much room for her, and she put first her right leg and then her left inside. Then she squatted, stretching her right leg across as she moved in. I held my breath as I feasted my eyes on her beautiful little vagina, only a foot in front of me. She put her head inside, opposite me, and sat down with a slight bump, knees up and legs apart. I could see that lovely little slit from top to bottom.\nIt’s strange how girls can go so quickly from modesty or shyness to complete trust. I looked lovingly at Angela sitting opposite me, only a few inches away. Two days earlier she would never have shared her nakedness with me, yet now she seemed quite unaware of it.\n“I feel squashed,” she whispered.\n“It’ll be all right,” I whispered back, moving my legs over hers. We were sitting now with faces less than a foot apart, and my penis almost touching her vagina. I smiled at her. She liked to pretend to be so composed, but she was really a very emotional girl - or was it just that she was in love with me? I took my elbows off my knees and gently cupped her face in my hands, kissing her gently. She blushed furiously I could see even in the dim light of the hole, but smiled at me very shyly but very lovingly. In the distance I thought I could hear Lynn’s call.\nI pulled her a little closer. She put her arms round my neck and placed her cheek against mine. I could now feel my penis throbbing just under her bottom. I held her sweet little body close to mine, skin against skin, and it was lovely.\n“You know something, Angela?” I whispered. “I love you.”\nAngela stirred against me and I wondered what she was feeling. This time I could feel her cheek hotly against mine. Then she replied in a trembling voice, “I love you too.”\n“You are so pretty,” I went on. “And such a lovely person. You know, whenever you want me, I’ll be there for you.” I told her where my house was, and kept on whispering sweet nothings into her ear. She cuddled me tightly and responded to my kisses. I could feel her smooth skin pressed against my cheek, my arms, my chest, my stomach and my bulging penis. But I would never abuse this sweet, innocent girl.\nThen I heard could hear a rustling in the jungle just above us and heard the murmur of voices. Lynn and Brenda were coming our way. I whispered to Angela to stay quiet, and we waited. They headed for the log pile and walked round it in case anyone was behind it. I could see Brenda standing almost above us, her thin legs meeting at the top in a tight little vagina, the first good view I had had of her. If she had looked down I’m sure she would have seen us, but she was looking round her instead. They saw nothing and soon moved off.\nWe waited, and then we heard a yell of triumph from perhaps thirty yards away. It was Sally. “That’s ten minutes and nobody found me! All right, everybody, you can come out now!”\nSmiling, we emerged from our hole, and immediately saw we were quite dirty from the slightly damp soil. We made our way back to the pool, stopping to wash ourselves on the way. Angela crouched down by a tap and I washed her back, bottom and legs as well as I could, and she did the same to me. That was why we were last back at the pool, to see that Lynn and Brenda had only been able to find Laureen. The girls were waiting impatiently for me to choose another number.\n“Angela, you’re chasing now,” Shelley told her.\n“Roy, will you come with me?” asked Angela, looking pleadingly into my eyes.\n“No, those are the rules,” decided Shelley. “Roy must now choose a number for someone else to hide with him. Any number except five.”\n“All right - number one,” I said.\n“Yes!” screamed Laureen. “That’s me!”\nAs Angela counted, I led the way to my next hiding place, with Laureen keeping very close behind me. This one was a thicket. There were several bushes all very close together, growing so thickly that it was impossible to see into them. But once somebody plunged inside, there was an open place about two yards wide with plenty of room to hide.\nI led the way, plunging through the thick leaves and twigs into the open space. There was a small pool of sunlight, and I sat down in it on a thick pile of dead leaves. Laureen looked delighted as she flopped full length next to me and then rolled over on her side, propping herself up on one elbow. “This is like a little house,” she whispered.\nThe bushes around grew so thickly that it was impossible to see more than a few spots of light the other side. Nobody who didn’t know it existed could think of finding anybody there.\nI lay back, and Laureen turned and laid her head back on my chest. I’m sure she must have heard my heart pounding as I gazed down the length of her body. I could see down her slim neck to those two little mounds on her chest with clear nipples on top. Then down her pale white stomach to her loins, down to her groin, but from my position not quite far enough to see any further. I gave her shoulder a gentle rub with my hand.\nAfter a moment she sat up and looked at me challengingly. “Close your eyes,” she instructed. I did so. She took my hand and moved it, putting it down on a small soft lump. “Feel it,” she ordered.\nI felt her little breast gently with my fingers. Firm on top, but wobbly as I stroked it. Not knowing how much it would hurt, I rubbed and felt very carefully. Then she moved my hand over to the other one.\n“What are these things?” I asked, still with my eyes shut and pretending not to know.\n“Haven’t you ever felt a boob before?” came Laureen’s voice, pretending to scold. “All right, you can open your eyes.”\nGently I pulled her under the shoulders to move her up and across my chest, with her fair hair resting under my chin. Then I put my arms round her, one hand on each breast, and stroked gently. It felt so good, and I suspected she was watching to see what effect this had on my penis.\nAll was quiet around us. After a while Laureen told me a second time, “Close your eyes.” Then she took my right hand and moved it again, pulling it almost to the full length of my arm. Then she put it down again, placing it carefully. I could feel something warm and soft and slightly damp that went down in the middle and ended between two long soft poles. I ran my finger very lightly up and down the middle, and Laureen giggled and jerked her body suddenly. “That tickles,” she giggled.\n“What is it?” I asked her.\nLaureen put her head back and I could feel her warm breath in my ear.\n“It’s a very special reward,” she breathed, so quietly I could hardly hear her and very unlike her usual strident tone. “Stroke the little pussy!”\nI opened my eyes and stared at her, pretending to be horrified.\n“Laureen!” I breathed in a shocked tone. “I can’t believe it!”\nLaureen began to give a squeal of laughter and then strangled it quickly. “It’s all yours today,” she whispered, putting an arm round my neck and pulling her body further up so that her vagina was more easily within my reach. “Tickle me again.”\nI did, rubbing those little folds of skin very lightly with my fingers, each time causing her body to jerk and her mouth to splutter as she choked back her giggles. “When you’ve finished it’s my turn,” she whispered to me. I did not really want to let this precocious girl loose on my penis, so I hoped I could stretch out ‘my turn’ as long as possible.\nAs I moved my fingers slowly lower, caressing gently, the wriggles and giggles increased. She lay back with her legs open and her little breasts about six inches from my face, kicking and giving little moans as my fingers explored the bottom-most part between her legs. Then I seemed to find a particularly sensitive part, as she gave a sudden sharp jerk backwards and a muffled shriek.\nAt that moment I heard a voice a few yards away from us, on the other side of the bushes. “Who’s that?” called Angela. “There’s somebody in there.”\nLaureen clamped her hand over her mouth and stared at me in horror, eyes filled with guilt. Then slowly she seemed to realize that she had only been heard and Angela could not have known what we were doing. But we froze, hoping Angela would not know where the sound had come from.\nWe heard a rustling of leaves and saw some twigs move. After a few seconds Angela broke through and stared at us. “I’ve caught you!” she exclaimed in glee. Then she looked around and said, “This is just like a little cave!”\nCaught, we followed her out and then made our way back towards the pool, with Laureen looking very disappointed. I had mixed feelings, wondering just how far Laureen would have gone had she not given the game away. I felt rich warmth in my loins from the memory of what we had done together, but was in a way relieved that she had not been able to let herself loose on my private parts.\nWe found Nicky there already, caught by Angela. We had a quick dip in the pool before we heard Sally’s triumphant cry announcing that ten minutes were up and she still hadn’t been caught. All the girls returned, but were thirsty, so we had another drink. Then I chose number four.\n“Me, me, me!” squealed Nicky, bouncing up and down like a two-year-old, then wrapping her arms found my waist and putting her curly head against my chest. We made for the back while Laureen counted, Nicky still holding on to my hand.\nThis time we made for a tree. There were several mulberry trees only about twenty yards from the back door but the leaves, used to feed Shelley’s silkworms, were so thick that it was impossible to see up into the branches. The ground was thick with fallen mulberries and our feet were immediately stained purple. I put my hand against the trunk of one a little further in. “Let’s go up here,” I whispered. “Can you climb it?”\n“I may need help,” she said, looking at it.\n“Tell me what you want me to do,” I whispered, not wanting to touch a naked body without permission.\n“Lift me up,” she said.\nI knelt down, put my arms round her thighs and my shoulder under her bottom, and gently lifted her up so she could stand in the fork of the tree. I soon realized I had chosen the wrong girl to hide with in a tree. Nicky is such a little beauty that I think her parents had brought her up to be very ladylike, and she seemed to have no idea at all about climbing trees. She stood in the fork looking helpless until I told her where to put her foot next. She was still struggling when we heard Laureen call and we were still not hidden.\n“Quickly,” I hissed, putting a hand under her bottom and hoisting her up to a strong branch. She struggled clumsily to find something to hold on to. “Hold the trunk,” I hissed, clambering up after her. I pulled myself quickly on to the next branch, about three feet above her head, and squatted. My left arm was wrapped around the trunk and my penis dangled between my legs.\nI reached a hand down. “Grab my hand,” I told her. When she put a hand up, I reached down full length, grabbed her firmly around the wrist and then stood up, hauling her bodily up to the branch with me.\nShe squealed quietly and looked at me in wonder with those big beautiful hazel eyes. “Gee, you’re strong!” she said in awe, sitting next to me on the branch, her leg against mine.\nWe still weren’t quite out of sight so I whispered, “Next branch. Stand up.” I had chosen the wrong tree as well as the wrong girl. This one did not have enough branches close to the ground. Nicky immediately put one mulberry-stained foot on the next branch while I held her, stretching her leg high to reach it.\nAt that moment I could see between the branches Laureen making her way quietly through the trees, on a course that would take her close to us.\n“Still,” I whispered, and Nicky froze while I held her tightly.\nI watched as Laureen crept stealthily almost underneath us, looking this way and that but never thinking to look upwards. I turned back to Nicky, and suddenly realized what I could see. There, a few inches away from my eyes, was the most perfect little vagina you could imagine, stretched slightly open to reveal a darker pink and little folds of flesh and membrane inside. I gazed enraptured, a warm smile taking over my face. She was indeed a little beauty in every way. Only with great difficulty did I stop myself from kissing her there.\nShe was looking down at me with a white face, though. We were more than three yards above the ground and she was frightened, unused to it.\n“Just one more branch,” I whispered. “I’ll hold you.”\n“Please help me up,” she whimpered.\n“Shall I push you here?” I asked, indicating the place under her crotch but not wanting to touch without permission. I couldn’t in fact see any other way to hoist her up from below.\n“Yes,” she whispered, so I put one hand underneath, trying to avoid putting pressure on her vagina, and pushed gently, steadying her with my other hand. She scrambled up rather clumsily, sitting on the branch and holding to the trunk for dear life. Keeping a hand on her still, I lifted myself up next to her.\nI saw little tears welling over her eyelids and rolling down her pretty face. “What’s the matter, darling?” I whispered, using a pet name without even thinking about it and putting an arm tightly round her.\n“You hurt me,” she whispered. With my arm round her, she let go of the trunk with one hand and clutched her hurting vagina, doubling up a little.\n“I’m sorry, I would never ever want to do that,” I whispered, full of tenderness, kissing her gently on the cheek. She didn’t respond, but I held her closely, pressing my cheek against hers. About a minute later, as the pain wore off. She looked at me and smiled, her big eyes still damp. I reached up a finger and gently dabbed away a teardrop from her eye.\n“I like you,” she whispered. “You’re kind.”\n“I love you,” I whispered back. “You’re sweet.”\n“I love you too,” she responded, laying her golden head on my shoulder.\nI laid a hand gently round the back of her head and kissed her again.\nAgain my heart and my loins warmed with the pleasure of this moment.\nA few minutes later we heard a wail of frustration from Sally, caught for the first time, and a yell of triumph from Laureen. It was not long afterwards that we heard Sally, from the direction of the pool this time, call for time up. I climbed down the tree first, bit by bit, and helped Nicky down from each branch. So often I reached up for her, finding her legs open before me and her arms round my neck as I helped her down. At the bottom she reached up to put her arms round my neck and we had another good hug, the warm skin of our chests pressing against each other. “There you are,” I whispered, smiling into her blue eyes. “Didn’t I tell you that you were always safe with me?”\nWe were the last to arrive back at the pool, due to the time taken climbing down the tree. Angela and Lynn had been caught as well as Sally, and I chose number three. Sally gave a squeal and Shelley a groan, and I took Sally with some misgivings.\nMy three best hiding places had been used, but the others didn’t know that - or some of them didn’t, anyway. “Take me where you took Laureen,” demanded Sally, holding my hand and looking up at me with her wide, baby-blue eyes, her untidy hair spread all over a dirty but attractive face. I thought to myself that this girl may be a bit of a terror, but at least everything about her was straight-forward and honest.\n“We can’t go in the same place again; we’ll be found,” I protested.\n“Yes, we can; no, we won’t,” pouted Sally firmly. She swung behind me and grabbed me by the shoulders. “Piggy-back! Up!” She leapt up and threw her arms round my neck, while I grabbed her round her legs. “Gee up, horsey!” she cried, giving me a smacking kiss by my ear.\nI carried her all the way to the little thicket and crouched to go inside with her on my back. She squealed and ducked her head to avoid the low branches. I suddenly wished I had been firm about finding somewhere else. Alone in here with Sally could be dangerous.\nI slipped her down behind me, and she lay on her back with her legs curled up under her chin, so I could see everything from her cute bottom to the mound where her vagina ended, all the way up like a zip fastener to the top. My penis began to respond, so I sat down at an angle to try to cover it.\nSally sat up, with her knees up and well apart so as to give me the best possible view of her vagina. It was wide open, gaping, with a dark moist pink color inside. She bent her head between her legs to look herself, and then looked up at me again, with a challenging look of daring and excitement on her face. Was she trying to shock or embarrass me? I didn’t know, but decided to play it cool.\n“Very nice,” I said casually. “Do you always show boys what you look like inside?”\nSally giggled. “Only boys I like,” she said. “Let me show you how I did a wee-wee when I was little.” She shot a little jet of urine from her vagina towards me for a moment, and repeated it several times.\n“Remind me not to sit there,” I said, turning my eyes away to stare through the leaves in case Nicky was looking for us.\n“Look what I can do,” said Sally. I turned to see her licking a finger and then pushing it in and out of her vagina, holding it open wider still with her other hand.\n“We could have sex in here, you know,” Sally said in a very precocious way. “And nobody would find out.”\n“Have you ever had sex before?” I asked her, still playing it cool.\n“Oh, yes, a few times,” she claimed, but her open face showed quite clearly that this was not true.\n“Who with?” I asked.\n“Oh, some boys,” she answered. “Do you want me to show you how?”\nI thought that was enough. I was sorely tempted, but my sense of responsibility, and perhaps fear, took over. “Look, I’m not going to have sex with you,” I told her firmly. “It’s against the law, because you’re too young.” (So was I, but that was beside the point.) “It would be an awful thing to have sex with you when I’m supposed to be looking after you. Now behave yourself properly. That’s a very stupid and naughty way to behave with a boy, and you could easily do it with a boy who would hurt you.”\nTo my astonishment, Sally looked completely shocked. She stared at me in horror with wide open eyes. Big tears welled up and rolled down her cheeks. She suddenly looked so pitiful and ashamed. She certainly wasn’t putting on an act. Once again my feeling for helpless females rose to the top.\n“Come here, Sally,” I said gently, holding out my arms to her.\nWith tears still falling, Sally shuffled obediently over to me, looking at me all the time with big mournful eyes. I sat her on my thigh and put my arms round her gently. She buried her face in my shoulder and I could feel her body heaving as she sobbed.\n“Listen, Sally,” I whispered in her ear, and spoke slowly and gently to her. “I don’t want you to get hurt. I would never ever do anything to harm you, but other people might. I love the way you are so full of fun and friendliness. Being naked is wonderful and good fun. But it’s not good to show off your body and think about having sex. It’s too dangerous. I want to look after you and protect you. But I can’t always do that, so you must look after yourself.”\nHer body stopped heaving, but her face remained buried in my shoulder and I wondered what she was thinking. After about a minute she finally raised her head and looked at me with her dirty, tear-stained face.\n“Sorry,” she whispered. I gave her a gentle kiss on the nose, and slowly saw her face light up. “I love you,” she said, giving me a smacking wet kiss on the cheek. “I don’t mind you seeing my pussy because I trust you.”\nSuddenly she was back to her usual happy self, but somehow different, without so much silliness. She chattered away in my ear, probably about her family or school or something, but I was hardly listening, just enjoying the protective love I suddenly felt for her.\nShe lay back with her head on my shoulder and took my hand. She guided it downwards to that secret place between her legs and placed it on her vagina. “Please stroke me,” she whispered, turning her head to look at me pleadingly.\n“All right, as you’re so much more sweet and sensible now,” I whispered, stroking her gently, feeling with my fingertips her little mound and the soft warm slit in between.\nShe closed her eyes, a look of intense pleasure on her face.\n“Mmmmmmmmmm!” she hummed, and wriggled gently with ecstasy. “I love it when you do this to me,” she whispered. “Tickle me too.” I did so gently, and she wriggled and giggled most delightfully. I kissed her cheek gently, and she gave me a wet, dirty, sticky kiss in return.\nThen suddenly she remembered and looked at her watch. “We’ve had three minutes extra!” she squealed, leaping up and dashing out through the bushes. “Yippee!” I heard her yelling. “Time’s up and nobody’s found me!”\nI followed her out through the thicket, grinning. She grabbed me by the hand and started dragging me towards the pool. “We’d better wash your face first or everyone will know you’ve been crying,” I told her. We stopped by a tap and she let me wash all the tears and grime off her face gently. I tried to pull her untidy hair back, but as soon as I let go it just flopped back again. “We’ll have to get a stapler for your hair,” I joked.\n“What number?” shouted out Shelley, jumping up and down, as we got back, to find that this time Brenda and Angela had been caught.\n“Number six,” I called out teasingly.\n“There isn’t a six - it’s me, number two,” she insisted. “Come on, let’s go.” As we trotted off round the back of the house, Shelley whispered, “I’ve got a good idea. Let’s just sit on the back doorstep!\nI bet Sally will never think of looking for us there!”\n“She’ll see us when she comes round the corner,” I argued.\n“No, she won’t; you don’t know Sally,” giggled Shelley. “Come on, let’s do it.”\nRather doubtful, I followed her over to the back door, about fifteen yards along the wall of the house from the corner. It was partly hidden by a flower bed, but nobody looking in that direction could fail to see us.\nWe waited a short while, then heard Sally’s yell: “Coming, ready or not!” Moments later she came racing round the corner of the house, across the small back lawn and plunging into the jungle without so much as a glance round.\n“Told you!” giggled Shelley. She had been right.\nAfter a moment Shelley stood up and came to sit on my lap, legs apart and facing me. She looked serious. I put my hands on her hips and rubbed her up and down gently. Then I asked, “What’s the matter, Shell?”\n“Roy,” she said, slowly and thoughtfully. She paused. “Roy, do you love the other girls more than me?”\nI smiled gently at her, shaking my head. I was sure she meant her friends rather than Lynn, as she had never shown any jealousy of Lynn, recognizing it was a different relationship. “No, no,” I replied, moving my arms up under her shoulders to rub the back of her neck.\n“Nobody can ever take the place of my little cousin. You’re always going to be special to me. But I like your friends too, so I’m just spending time getting to know them.”\nShelley put her face close to mine, smiling into my eyes. “Just testing you,” she said, but I knew it was more than that. She leaned back with her eyes shut, head back until she almost touched the ground with her head while I held her. She may be my cousin, but it still warms me to see her vagina open so trustingly like that. Then I pulled her up and we sat and waited, Shelley’s head on my shoulder.\n“All my friends are in love with you,” she whispered.\nIt was probably true, I thought. I had never rated myself as being particularly good-looking, but I realized it was more than that. Was it because I was always gentle with them? Because I made them feel beautiful? Because I made them feel safe? Because I trusted them as well, even with my own nudity?\nAs we sat there, first Brenda and then Nicky walked past us to the pool, having been caught. They both saw us, but we put our fingers to our lips to keep them quiet.\nThen at last we heard Sally calling from the depths of the jungle, “Ten minutes and I’ve found two people. Come out, everybody!”\n“Let’s wait till she comes back,” laughed Shelley.\nA minute later Sally came into sight, walking out of the jungle. She saw us immediately, and stopped and stared. “Hey, what are you doing there?” she demanded.\n“We were here all the time!” laughed Shelley, standing up and clapping her hands with glee. “You ran right past us and you didn’t even see us!”\nFor once, Sally was almost speechless. Then she had a good giggle about it as we returned to the pool.\n“Now it’s Lynn’s and Brenda’s turn to go with Roy,” said Shelley.\n“Three is too many, I think,” smiled Lynn. “I can stay out this time.\nBrenda, will you go with Roy?” She smiled at me. “We can hide together when we get home,” she said.\nBrenda looked at me rather timidly, unable to make up her mind. I smiled at her encouragingly. “Please come with me, Brenda,” I asked her. “But you don’t have to if you don’t want to.”\nBrenda turned to Lynn and said, “I’ll go.” She smiled up at me rather tremblingly, and then put her cold little hand into mine.\n“Let’s find a tree to climb,” I suggested. “Shelley knows this garden so well she knows all the other hiding places, but it will take her a bit longer to look in all the trees.”\nBrenda nodded confidently, and I quickly found she was a very good tree climber. I watched her climb nimbly up a tall tree near the back fence, moving easily from branch to branch and giving heart-warming glimpses of her vagina between her legs. I did not choose a mulberry tree as I was sure Shelley would look there first, but not too many of the others had thick enough leaves. Often hiders could get away with a rather bare tree, though, as the seekers often forgot to look upwards.\nWe sat over the leafiest part on the tree we could find, and I asked Brenda if she often climbed trees. In a quiet whisper she told me about her old house in England where they lived before moving out here, and how it was next to a wood where she often climbed with her older brothers and sisters. She was the youngest of a large family, and it seemed to me as if she had been rather ignored. We straddled the branch facing each other, and she now seemed quite unconcerned about my exposed penis or her own vagina, small and tight.\nFrom where we sat we could see glimpses of Shelley rummaging through the bushes, knowing the most likely hiding places and finding the others one by one. She also remembered to look into trees, but the ten minutes were almost up, and we were just wondering if we might avoid being caught, when she came our way, scanning the trees, and quickly saw us. “Roy, Brenda, got you!” she screamed at the top of her voice.\n“That’s everybody! I’ve won!”\nI started to move down the tree, but Brenda said, “Wait!” I stopped and looked at her, smiling. She hesitated and then said, “I - I want to kiss you.”\n“On one condition,” I told her gently. “On condition I kiss you back.”\nFor answer she put one arm round my neck, holding on to the tree with the other, and gave me a sweet little kiss on the cheek. I gave her a warm one in return, and she broke into a brilliant smile.\nWhen we returned to the pool, the others told her that she hadn’t won yet as I had not yet been It. “All right, then, last round,” she agreed. “Roy, let me seek with you!”\nI had a loud clamor of girls all wanting to seek with me, but I solved it by saying that wouldn’t be fair and I would seek alone. I put my face to the tree, closed my eyes and counted to two hundred before calling out and going on my search.\nIt was very quiet, and at first I was puzzled as I searched here and there, including the mulberry trees. But I could not find any girl anywhere. Suddenly I wondered if they were perhaps all hiding together.\nThat would not surprise me, and there was only one place where they could be.\nAs silently as possible, I moved towards that little thicket. I was so quiet that as I stopped next to it I could hear a very faint murmur of voices from within. But quietly as I tried to push my way in, I could not help rustling branches and all fell immediately silent.\nI pushed my way through the brush and put my head through into the open space. I saw seven little bodies, curled up flat on the ground, still and silent. They could all have been asleep the way they looked. The nearest one was Nicky. I reached out my hand and gently tickled the sole of her foot.\nThe silence was broken. Nicky jumped and screamed, and then laughed hard. The others all got a fright at the scream, and jumped up with squeals of their own. I leapt into the middle of them, wrestling gently with any body in my way. Then they recovered and all dived on top of me. I gave up and lay on my back, with seven delightful girls pinning me down and laughing at me.\n“Tickle him!” shouted Nicky. They all tried, but I am not very ticklish and they didn’t have the technique, so it had little effect.\nLaureen let out a deep breath. “That’s been a wonderful morning,” she announced. “I’m thirsty.”\n“Drinks, then,” I suggested. “Help me up.” I held out my arms and, giggling, the girls pulled me to my feet, with Lynn and Sally pushing from behind as well.\n“Then what shall we do?” asked Angela on our way back to the house.\n“Miss Beautiful Skins!” shouted Nicky, who had won on Saturday.\n“Miss Beautiful Boobs and Pussy,” giggled Laureen.\n“That wouldn’t be easy,” I said, “unless you all wear different skins from the ones you wore on Saturday.”\n“Let’s have Miss Beautiful Bikini,” suggested Shelley.\n“We can’t do that because we’ve only one bikini,” said Angela.\n“We can make bikinis for everybody,” announced Shelley. “Purple mulberry bikinis! I’ll tell you how!”\nPart 7\nWe had our drinks while Shelley talked excitedly about her idea. “It’s called body painting,” she explained. “And we’ll use mulberry juice.\nWe’ll pick up all the mulberries lying on the ground and make them into juice. Then we can paint bikinis on ourselves and have a Miss Beautiful Bikini competition!”\nThe girls all loved the idea. “And you must do it as well, Roy,” insisted Shelley, supported by the others. “And Lynn.”\nAfter drinks we all began to move outside to the mulberry trees. “What shall we put the juice in?” asked Laureen.\n“I’ll get some jars from the cupboard,” said Shelley.\n“They won’t hold very much juice,” I said. “Can you think of anything bigger?”\nThey couldn’t, so I made my suggestion. “Perhaps we can get that wheelbarrow out of your shed and fill it with mulberries. Then we can take it in turns to get in the wheelbarrow and stomp all the juice out of the mulberries. We’ll get plenty that way.”\nThe girls looked at each other, eyes shining. They liked that idea. We opened the shed and I trundled the barrow to the trees with difficulty, because they all wanted a ride in it. Then we set to loading the barrow with mulberries.\nWhen it was half full, I said, “That should be enough for everybody.”\n“Now over to the pool,” said Shelley.\n“I don’t know whether your mum and dad would want a purple lawn,” I answered. “I think we had better do the stomping somewhere over here where it doesn’t matter if we spray mulberries everywhere.”\nThey saw the sense of that, so we wheeled the barrow into a little clearing. “Me first!” shouted Shelley. I held the barrow steady while she trod on the mulberries, carefully at first but then gaining in confidence. Soon she was leaping up and down, dancing and singing, and sending mulberry parts and juice flying. The rest of us, close by, began to get stains on our skins.\n“What a good thing we haven’t our clothes on,” laughed Nicky. “My mum would be so cross if I got mulberry juice all over my dress.”\nAfter a minute or two Shelley gave way to Laureen and each of the girls took a turn. There was much laughter and more mulberry juice going everywhere, so I said, “If you get any more juice on you, nobody will be able to see your bikinis when you make them.”\n“We’ll have to wash off first,” said Brenda, who managed to climb on the barrow for the next turn.\nAfter about twenty minutes they had all had their turn, some more than once, and the barrow was awash with juice, amid of course a great deal of other squashed mulberry parts. All of us were stained with the purple juice and would have to wash before we could do any painting of bikinis.\nWhile I wheeled the barrow, the girls ran for the garden tap, while Shelley ran indoors for some flannels and soap. She found four of each, so the flannels had to be shared. There were choruses of “Please wash me, Roy!”\nI was rather worried about both the washing and the painting, as I did not want to be in trouble for touching girls around the vagina - unless invited, of course. So I said, “Look, we’re going to need to do this in pairs. I’ll go with Lynn, because she’s my girl-friend and it’s time I gave her some attention.” Also it wouldn’t matter where I touched Lynn.\n“So perhaps the rest of you can get into pairs.”\nThey paired off quickly, with some moans about how lucky Lynn was.\nShelley went with Brenda, Nicky with Angela, and of course Laureen and Sally got together with much giggling. “First of all we wash each other,” I said. “And then we can paint each other.”\nEach pair took a flannel and got to work. Lynn and I were much cleaner than the girls and most of the juice was on our legs. Sally needed more cleaning than anybody, as she had managed to sit down in it while she was trampling the mulberries. Laureen had her lying down on her front while she rubbed away at her bottom. “You know, Sally, you have a very wobbly bottom,” she said as she scrubbed. “I hope your boobs don’t grow like that.”\nThe other girls were getting impatient, so I said, “Don’t worry too much about it now; that’s her problem really.” So Sally got off her tummy and we prepared to paint.\nWe trundled the barrow over to the area near the pool, although I warned everybody at the start that they would not be allowed to swim and mess up the pool water until they were quite clean again afterwards. “What’s the use of a bikini if you’re not allowed to swim in it?” asked Shelley.\n“How often do you ever swim in a bikini?” I asked, and she laughed.\nShelley had fetched a jug for each pair, and we filled our jugs at the barrow, emptying out all the solids still there. Sally immediately spilt hers down her leg and had to go and wash again. Unfortunately there were no paintbrushes, apart from a toy one of Shelley’s that was much too small, so we had to paint with our fingers.\n“The best way I think is to make an outline of the bikini first,” I suggested to them all. “Then when you have that right, you can fill it in. Just like when you paint a picture.”\n“Let’s do you first,” I said to Lynn. So she stood there while I put some juice on my fingers and traced the outline on her body. I was well prepared to enjoy myself as I stood behind her and gently drew the outline of a bikini top around her swelling breasts. They are very clearly defined so I just ran my finger around the outside.\nI soon realized that it is not so easy to do a good job after puberty, as Lynn’s pubic hair prevented me from giving her a proper bikini bottom. I had to stop when my fingers reached her hair, but not before she shivered, giggled and said, “That tickles!”\nI kept an eye on the other girls, and every pair seemed to be having long discussions, with a lot of trial and error, over where to draw the lines. I was soon painting in Lynn’s bikini top, smearing the mulberry juice over her breasts. They are soft but firm, and I took particular care drawing little circles round the nipples simply because I enjoyed the feel of them wobbling gently under my fingers as I painted.\nI looked at Lynn, and we laughed into each other’s eyes. Forgetting the others for a while, I impulsively laid Lynn down on her back, sat gently on her tummy and leaned closely over her face as I rubbed in the purple juice very gently. When I had finished, I painted in the bottoms, although again I had to stop when I reached the pubic hair.\nLynn insisted on as small a bikini as possible, so I did just enough to cover her groin. Then I turned her over and gently kneaded it into her firm tanned bottom and down between her legs, feeling the long hairs hanging down and her mound ever so carefully and delightfully.\nI stood back and looked at it, but wasn’t really satisfied. Mulberry juice is not thick enough for painting people properly with, and it didn’t look as close to being a proper bikini as it would had we been able to use paint.\nLynn wanted to know what she looked like, so I went indoors and managed to unhook a large mirror and bring it outdoors. Lynn looked at herself but didn’t seem very impressed, and I don’t blame her. All the other girls crowded round, in various stages of being painted, to see how they looked. Most of them had not got very far yet. They seemed rather disappointed that the juice was not working very well.\nNow it was Lynn’s turn to paint me, just the bottom part, of course.\nShe put it on as thick as she could, also stroking it carefully into my penis and testicles as I stood there trying not to get aroused. But the results were pretty pale.\nLynn had finished me before the other girls had even got halfway. We went round to have a look. Sally was smearing juice all over Laureen’s pubic area, and she was asking, “What happens when I do a wee?” Brenda was rubbing vigorously at Shelley, who was helping, but again the mulberry juice was not most effective. Nicky was standing elegantly with her hands on her head while Angela painted her bottom.\nThen Sally said, “You know, mud would be better than this. Roy, may we paint with mud?”\n“That sounds like a good idea,” I agreed. Most of the girls agreed excitedly, although Nicky did not look happy. I think she’s too ladylike to enjoy the idea of mud.\nWe scampered round the back to the shed, where Shelley found some empty pots. We dug up some earth from the jungle and then went to add water.\n“Just a bit at a time,” I told them. “If you get the mud too thin, it won’t work properly.”\n“Do we have to use mud too?” Lynn asked me, also not liking the idea.\nShe was referring to the two of us.\n“I don’t think so,” I replied. “We’ve got our costumes, even if they’re not very clear.”\nLaureen and Sally, of course, put in too much water in spite of what I said, so they had to pour some of it out and fetch some more soil. They all mixed and squeezed in the pots with their fingers and soon had some good thick smooth mud ready to use.\nLaureen stood up quickly and started smearing mud all over her front and down between her legs, while Sally protested that this was supposed to be her job. Laureen had been too enthusiastic, and mud started dripping down her leg. She had a thick coating of mud over her skin, but it was still possible to trace the outline of her vagina through it.\nNicky decided to keep to the mulberries, although it was not very effective, but Shelley was another enthusiastic mud-user. When Brenda proved to be slow and hesitant in applying it, Shelley called on me to come and help. Brenda didn’t mind, so I started off rubbing mud gently into her smooth round bottom. This brought appeals for help from the other pairs, though, so I stopped so as to avoid getting involved, and Lynn took over.\n“The winner of the Miss Beautiful Bikini competition,” I said, “will be the painter, not the wearer! So I can’t go round doing it for you all.”\nSlowly the bikinis took shape and developed. Many of the girls used a mixture of mud and mulberry juice, and even tried to decorate them with leaves, although most of them quickly fell off when the mud dried. It took a long time for them to agree on the shapes and the materials, and I honestly had to admit the results were not very good. We really needed proper paint, such as is used in proper body painting, and I would have to ask Aunt Sue about that.\nI would have preferred to wash my own costume off, but the girls protested. They may have looked at least partly as if they were wearing costumes themselves, but mine could never pass for a costume with the genitals hanging down and nowhere to tuck them, whereas a girl’s can largely be hidden. Anyway, at least I didn’t have to take part in the competition, and I sat as usual in my deck chair to judge.\nIt was not very inspiring this time. Sally insisted on being first, and she was rather too muddy. The mud had run in streaks down her legs and she had not been able to rub it off very well. She would certainly have been a show-off as a model, as she put on a very artificial act, turning and stretching and dancing with exaggerated elegance. As with the other mud costumes, the shape of her vagina was still clear. She had obviously been told what to do when she finished, as she minced daintily off the stage over to my deck chair, leaned on my shoulder and then rolled on to my lap.\n“Yuck!” I protested, half in fun, as large areas of dried mud came in contact with my own skin. She only smiled and sat quietly on my lap, much more sensible in her behavior with me now, but quite confident of her ability to charm me with her new method. And she did succeed.\nNext was Laureen, in thick mud but with even worse streaks down her legs. I was glad some of the others looked better than these two, but I knew now it wasn’t easy to produce good costumes with the limited materials we had.\nNicky and Angela had done a fine job between them. Nicky had refused to use mud but Angela, who had painted her, had painted very carefully a little purple bikini. Her little nipples and vagina were delightfully evident, but there were also darker and lighter patterns. Angela, who followed, had also used mainly mulberries, but Nicky had painted little dots and patterns in mud, so the effect was good.\nShelley’s costume had been partly painted by Lynn and myself, so she understood reluctantly that her costume, which should have been credited to her partner Brenda anyway, could not win this time. She was mainly in mud, and quite neatly done. She had been responsible for Brenda’s costume, which really did look good - as good as can be expected using mud. It supposedly had frills at the edges, fingered in very carefully, and animal heads had been outlined by way of patterns.\nOnly one thing had been forgotten, which became clear when Brenda stretched her legs up and revealed an expanse of white and pink under her crotch, which Shelley had forgotten about.\nThird prize I gave to Angela’s costume, painted by Nicky, and second to Nicky’s costume, painted by Angela. Brenda looked overjoyed to win first prize for hers, though the real winner was the painter, Shelley.\n“I want to wash off now,” said Nicky, shivering a bit because some heavy clouds had blown over the sun, and it looked like we might be in for one of those occasional midday summer downpours. The activity had not actually been a great success, although they had enjoyed it, and none of them really wanted to walk round in their painted costumes all day.\n“Why wasn’t my bikini good enough?” demanded Sally as we walked round to the taps.\n“Too much mud!” I explained to her.\n“I like being muddy,” she said. “You should be more muddy too.” She wrapped her arms round my waist and tried to rub off all the mud on her on to me.\nI reached down and slung an arm round her waist, then lifted her upside down that way. She screamed and laughed, kicking her legs wildly over my shoulders with her muddy little vagina right under my nose.\n“If you like being muddy, you can have some more,” I laughed, carrying her over to the barrow. I dumped her in the barrow and rolled her in the mulberry juice that was still there, while she laughed and screamed and kicked. “Quick, girls, bring the rest of that mud!” I called.\nGiggling, they ran off and came back with the pots still with plenty of mud inside.\nWe poured the mud over the thrashing body of Sally, who was by now almost helpless with laughter. Then I rubbed it in, all over her chest and her body, her bottom, her legs, even down between her legs. There was plenty of it and we all loved it.\nAt last we stood back and looked at out handiwork. Sally was covered with sticky brown mud from her shoulders downwards. As she kicked, the barrow tipped over. She landed in a muddy heap on the grass, and the remaining mud in the barrow sloshed out on top of her. She was a hilarious sight, and she was laughing almost until she cried. Then she got up and chased us, wrapping her arms round us and giving us as much of the mud as she could when she caught us.\nFinally, when the fun had worn off, it was time to get clean. “Right, in pairs again,” I said, as we filled some buckets with water from the tap and got the flannels and soap again. There was much giggling and squealing as the costumes came off. I soaped and flannelled Lynn over gently, rubbing the mulberry juice carefully off her breasts and loins, and then she did the same with my now very faded costume.\nWe were all just finishing the job when some big drops of rain began to fall. They quickly became heavier.\n“Shall we go inside?” Nicky asked me, just finishing the job of wiping off Angela’s cute bottom.\n“We’re too wet, I think,” I laughed.\n“I want to play in the rain!” shouted Shelley. Dropping the flannel and soap, she spread out her arms and scooted off at top speed, racing through the heavy rain, screaming with delight.\n“Catch her!” shouted Laureen, and she and Sally went racing after her.\nThe others soon followed, and I ran with them, enjoying the cold teeming rain pouring down on to my body.\n“Catch Roy!” screamed Shelley, turning and running towards me. I ran towards her rather than away, and she hurtled into my arms, wet and slippery as an eel. We both tumbled on the ground, laughing, and the other girls piled on top of us. Slippery wet bottoms tumbled on top of me as I struggled to sit up. Laureen was sitting on my chest, soaking wet vagina open inches from my nose. Sally pulled her backwards, and her legs shot upwards and then rolled off.\nIt was a glorious rough-and-tumble, and even Lynn joined in, although this is not normally her type of activity. Her pubic hair was glistening as water ran down it, making it look almost like a little beard. I grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her round, but my hands slid off her soaking wet breasts. Nicky, laughing, sprawled across my chest, and I could feel her little wet nipples. I reached out both hands to grab the nearest body to me, and a slippery wet Brenda slid into my arms and out again before I caught her more tightly. But her soaking little body again slipped out of the bottom of my grasp.\nScrambling to our feet, we chased each other round again. Sally slipped and fell over backwards, making an exhibition of herself as usual as she swung her open legs in the air, howling with laughter. Nicky looked a beautiful sight as she stood still in the rain, legs together so that her little vagina looked no more than an extension of the groove between them, head back, eyes closed, arms stretched upwards as she tried to catch the rain. Then Angela pointed to the tree near the verandah. There were our clothes, out in the rain and soaking wet!\nThere was nothing we could do about them, so we continued to enjoy the rain. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, it stopped. Clouds remained over the sun and a wind sprang up. Suddenly we felt chilly. I glanced downwards and saw my penis, small and tight in the cold rain, and my testicles, clinging up closer to my body.\n“I think we need a hot shower,” I grinned at the others. We could get that easily enough inside the house, but we were all soaking wet. Sally made a great display of her chattering teeth.\n“I know,” said Shelley. “Roy, you dry yourself and go inside. Then you can carry us all to the shower!”\nMy little cousin has some weird ideas, but I liked this one. The only problem was what to dry myself on, as it was all so wet outside. In the end I ran round the back, put my arm through the window, pulled a kitchen towel off the hook and ran back again with it.\nI sat down on the front doorstep but was not allowed to dry myself. The girls seized the towel between them and tried in a very disorganized way to dry me. I insisted that my feet and legs were the most important part as they would be in contact with the polished floor and carpet, and eventually, swamped by chattering girls who rubbed my legs up and down, I felt I was reasonably dry.\nStill a little damp, I entered the house and walked down the passage to the bathroom near the end. I turned on the heater and the shower, and then came back for the girls.\n“We’re going by numbers again,” Shelley told me. “Choose a number between one and seven!”\nMy first choice turned out to be Brenda. I lowered my head while she, smiling, reached up with her arms and clasped me round my neck. Then I gently lifted her in my arms and carried her down to the bathroom. She felt as light as a feather, and I loved her thin little face as she looked up so trustingly at me.\n“You don’t seem nervous of me any more!” I smiled at her as I put her gently down on the side of the bath.\n“Now I know you’re kind,” she whispered shyly. “I wish you were my big brother.”\n“Well, I wish you were my little sister,” I replied, smiling, as I returned for the next load. She slipped into the shower, where the water was now beautiful and warm.\nMy next choice turned out to be Angela. She lay peacefully back in my arms, her own arms folded across her tummy and her little bare body glistening with drops of water and goose flesh. She felt cold as I hugged her to my chest, but then I probably did to her as well. The only trace of color I could see on her was in her cheeks, pink as they so often were.\nI wondered if she blushed several hundred times every day, or whether it was just with me. Shelley later told me that it was mainly with me.\nAngela always pretended she did not like boys, according to Shelley, but she was certainly quite hopeless at pretending with me. I pressed my cheek against her forehead as I carried her down the passage and whispered, “You’re a very special girl.”\nLynn won the next round. I was quite used to carrying her, so the younger girls had felt lighter to me. She traveled with her arms round my neck, with her left breast pressing against my chest.\nSally, the next, had to be different. She wanted to be carried like a koala, sitting on my hips with her legs spread out each side of me, head against my throat and arms round my back. As I carried her, she released her arms and flopped backwards, head down and vagina wide open at my stomach level. With her head down and untidy hair hanging almost to floor level, I had to waddle along carefully until I dumped her on the toilet seat, much to her amusement.\nBack I went for Laureen. “I’m rather heavy,” she warned me as I picked her up side-saddle, her bottom resting on my hip. It was a rather awkward way to carry her anyway, and I caused much mirth as I staggered along, pretending to be ready to collapse under such a heavy load.\nAn impatient Shelley was next, leaping up and wrapping her arms round my shoulders, head and cold wet hair pressed against my neck. I held her just under her bottom as I carried her down to the bathroom, which was now getting rather crowded. The shower was, anyway, as all the girls I had carried in were squashing into it together, amid much squealing and laughter.\nFinally I went back to Nicky, who was shivering. Her little body felt so cold as I picked her up tenderly and held her in my arms like a baby. She snuggled up against me for warmth, and I smiled down at her, admiring the curves in her body. Her fair hair was still curly despite being wet and her little round face showed beautiful dimples as she smiled up at me despite her cold. Her neck curved beautifully down to her little round chest, and her sides curved in again and then out at the hips, all the way down between her legs, where I could just make out the top of her vagina lips curving delicately inwards.\nI kicked the front door shut and carried my little beauty into the bathroom, to find the shower bursting with girls. “Gangway!” I ordered, trying to push my way in, still carrying Nicky. I couldn’t, but willing if not so strong hands reached out to pull her inside. I could feel the warm steam flowing out of the shower and a few splashes of water. The noise was indescribable as seven naked girls squealed, sang and chattered away loudly as they warmed up. I sat on the side of the bath and waited for them, shivering.\nAfter about five minutes I heard Lynn’s voice saying, “Girls, what about poor Roy? He must be cold! We must get out and let him have a shower.”\nThey wanted to stay in, I could tell, but kindness won over and they began to emerge from the cubicle, grabbing for towels. Still shivering, I went in. It was such a relief to feel the warm water pouring down over my body.\nShelley put her head inside the shower. “May I come back in with you?” she asked.\nWithout thinking I said, “Yes,” and so opened the floodgates. Shelley leapt through the door into my arms. A moment later Sally’s face pushed its way inside, quickly followed by the rest of her body, and a horde of other bodies followed. Within seconds I was pressed against the back wall, with my penis squashed against Shelley’s tummy and scarcely able to move. The girls were all reaching out their arms towards me, wanting a hug and a cuddle. Lynn I saw at the back, smiling but unable to get in.\nThe little bodies felt warm and fresh now, and I quickly began to warm up. The spray sprinkled warm water over us all, and whenever I reached out I seemed to get a tangle of wet hair, which was tumbling down over their eyes and faces. Sally grabbed an arm and slobbered kisses over it. Nicky, arm at full length, was stroking my chest over Sally’s head.\nIt all felt so good, so wonderfully good.\nIn the end we all tired of it. We squeezed our way out of the shower, and of course the girls all wanted me to dry them. Taking Angela first, I wrapped a towel gently around her, knelt down next to her and rubbed.\nShe never took her blue eyes from me as I massaged her body, from head to toe and between her legs, ever so gently. I would never break the trust of these delightful little girls by abusing them sexually, although I do allow myself loving touching in private areas when I know they want me to. Carefully I lifted the towel to dry her hair and our bare bodies pressed together, her stomach pressed against my chest with her damp vagina just below as I rubbed.\nWhen I finished, I decided it was Lynn’s turn, as she had not been able to join us in the shower. She leaned back against me, eyes closed with a smile playing over her lips, as I dried her hair, then gently massaged her firm breasts. Working my way down, I tenderly dried her pubic hair and between her legs, and heard Laureen whisper, “Just like a husband and wife.”\nOne by one I dried them - Shelley, my excitable and loveable little cousin with her warm nature and warm body; the beautiful soft curvy Nicky; thin, delicate little Brenda; the saucy, wriggly and sometimes delightful Laureen; and the partially reformed Sally. It was a pleasure that I never wanted to end.\nBut it had to come to an end, and we had a problem. It would soon be time to go home and all our clothes were wet. Most of Shelley’s had just gone into the wash, so she had little to lend and I told her in any case I would not be seen dead in one of her mini-skirts.\n“I think we’ll just have to put on our wet underwear,” I told them all, “and explain that we got caught outside when the rain began. We needn’t mention that we were naked then anyway.”\nOutside the clouds had cleared away and the sun was shining down hotly again, raising steam from the driveway, the roof and the garden. I slipped with regret into my underpants. The girls sat on the front doorstep or on the ground next to it, putting on their panties. My loins warmed as I watched them lift their legs, saw the soft white lips of their little hairless vaginas from top to bottom, and grateful that I was counted as trustworthy of seeing what I did.\nThen we sat around on the grass in the shade waiting for the cars to arrive. Lynn was next to me, leaning on my shoulder with her head back and resting against my cheek. The girls were chatting, often several at once to me, and in front of me Laureen and Sally were talking and giggling together. Laureen idly reached inside her brief panties to scratch gently, giving me a glimpse of her lovely pink and white vagina as she did so. This was where it all started for me on Saturday, I remembered, when this pert, saucy girl had lost the pink panties she had been wearing then.\nLaureen glanced across at me and grinned, still scratching and quite careless of the fact that I could see her budding womanhood. My loins warmed again with the pleasure. “This is the life,” I thought. I said aloud, “What a lucky man I am. Here I am, sitting in the sun with my lovely wife and all my beautiful daughters.” I waited for the giggles to subside. “This is the life!”\nThe End\n",

  <div class="post-content"><h5 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#chapter-1">#</a></h5>
<p>My name is Roy and I was 15 years old at the time of this story. This is the story of a wonderful afternoon I enjoyed last year with my cousin Shelley and some of her friends.</p>
<p>Shelley was then 10, and we have grown up together almost as brother and sister. In fact, we have been closer than most brothers and sisters in many ways, not least because our families are nudists. Right from the beginning, then, ever since I helped change her nappies, we have been used to seeing every part of each other&rsquo;s bodies and have no secrets from each other.</p>
<p>The best way to describe Shelley, I suppose, is &lsquo;pert&rsquo;, although in a nice way. She is about average height for her age, is slim, has dark eyes and dark straight shoulder-length hair and a long fringe. She is very confident, perhaps as I would like to think because as a nudist she has never had anything to hide. She has always treated me just like a big brother, except that she respects me a lot more than many girls do their older brothers, including my own sister!</p>
<p>Anyway, a few days ago I was just finishing my lunch at home, with my girl-friend Lynn, when the telephone rang. My mother answered it and said it was for me. It was my Aunt Sue on the line. She had a problem and wondered if Lynn and I could help her.</p>
<p>First of all, she had planned that day, a Saturday during the school holidays, to take Shelley and some of her friends to a sort of open day at the embassy in the city centre where she works. I would probably have gone with them if Lynn had not been with me. The friends&rsquo; parents had dropped them at her house and she had driven them into the city, only to find that there had been a bomb scare and the whole open day had had to be postponed.</p>
<p>So my aunt took them all home again, and they decided between them that the girls might as well stay there for the day, rather than call their parents to collect them at an inconvenient time. Then, just as she had been about to prepare lunch for them, her telephone rang. An elderly friend of hers had had a nasty fall, broken her hip, and was being taken to hospital in a pretty bad condition. The friend had called for my aunt, and she knew she had to go and see her immediately.</p>
<p>Her problem was what to do with Shelley and her friends, who were all most disappointed to hear that they might have to be rushed back home.</p>
<p>Then Shelley suggested that she asked Lynn and me to come over and look after them for the afternoon. So, Aunt Sue asked me, could we help her out, and right away?</p>
<p>I had a quick word with Lynn, who was quite happy about that, and then told Aunt Sue we would be right over. We quickly flung on some clothes and hurried across, I on my own bicycle while Lynn borrowed my eight- year-old sister Jenny&rsquo;s. Jenny was away on a camp at this time.</p>
<p>It was about two miles to Aunt Sue&rsquo;s house, and it took us exactly ten minutes to get there from the time I put my phone down. We arrived to find Aunt Sue waiting in her car outside the gate, eager to be off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks very much, guys,&rdquo; she called out as she drove away down the road.</p>
<p>We cycled inside, and I closed the electronic gates behind us. Then we cycled down the drive and round the corner of the house towards the back door. It was there that we ran into an ambush.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was a deliberate ambush. Shelley and her friends had just been coming to meet us, and we met unexpectedly in that spot around the corner. As I cycled round the corner, with Lynn immediately behind me, Shelley flung herself at me, arms outstretched to wrap round my neck, shouting delightedly, &ldquo;Roy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t been expecting it, and her &lsquo;attack&rsquo; caught me off balance. I toppled over, still on the bicycle, with Shelley on top of me. As I landed on the ground, not really hurt but certainly startled, she rolled off and landed on her back just in front of me, laughing, with her knees up, giving me a wide view of her lovely white woolen panties under her short blue skirt.</p>
<p>Although most of the time Shelley and I have been together we have both been naked, I&rsquo;ve always shared an interest in her clothes, and she actually chatters away to me about her underwear very easily. No doubt when she feels ready for her first bra I will be the first to know, and she will probably ask my advice about what sort to get, too. I am not sure I want to go with her to buy it, though! Often when we are clothed she will show me what panties she is wearing, especially if she has a new pair. I have told her I like those woolen ones best, a rich white color with wide elastic hems and no lace. They feel so good, too; I can remember at times sitting with her on my lap and rubbing my hands gently on the material covering her soft little bottom while she smiles lovingly up into my face.</p>
<p>As a nudist I have never been curious about female anatomy, but I don&rsquo;t feel I know a girl properly until I have seen her naked and seen what type of underwear she uses. It still gives me warmth and a thrill to feel I&rsquo;ve been let in on something normally special and secret with the majority of the world&rsquo;s population. With Lynn I was lucky, as I first met her on a nudist beach. But more of that later.</p>
<p>As I lay with my right leg under my bicycle, enjoying the view up Shelley&rsquo;s skirt, I became aware of gales of laughter above me. The other five girls who were with her all seemed to think this was Christmas. I laughed too, and reached out my hand for Shelley, who scrambled to her knees and then threw herself, more successfully this time, into my arms, kissing me warmly on the cheek.</p>
<p>Lynn was behind me, still sitting on her bicycle and laughing too in her quiet way. Then I saw one of the other girls, whom I knew as Laureen, step over to her and whisper, more as a word of slightly shocked warning than anything else, &ldquo;You know, your skirt is short; you show your panties when you have your leg up like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Lynn, this is about the most stupid thing that anyone can say. Lynn is actually Danish, where most of the beaches are wide open for nudists. When she is clothed, she likes to wear the shortest mini- skirts possible. She says this is the only type of clothing in which she can feel at all free, and it is only reluctantly that she bows to convention and wears panties underneath. I think she would actually be quite happy walking down the main street of town stark naked, she is so unconcerned. So showing her panties means nothing at all to her.</p>
<p>She actually wears very attractive, sexy panties, when she can be persuaded to wear them at all. They are a brilliant white color, but the front of the crotch is made of an almost transparent kind of frills. I remember the day after she first arrived, we went to the big city park and set there opposite each other and talked. She sat there cross-legged, quite unconcerned that she was displaying those exciting panties in all their glory. I was more concerned than she was, with so many other people walking around, and I was afraid of what they might be thinking about me, with such an exhibitionist girl-friend. I made the excuse that my back was sore and suggested we sat on a bench. She leaned back and relaxed with her knees about a foot apart, so that was no better. I quickly encouraged her to sit on my lap. She did so, and I put my arms round her with my hands resting gently between her thighs so as to cover her from public (or pubic!) exposure.</p>
<p>After that, I got her to wear longer skirts when we went out, explaining that this country was much less liberated about female clothing than Denmark. Not that she had anything longer than mid-thigh.</p>
<p>But, with the hurry to get across to Aunt Sue&rsquo;s house, I had forgotten to check that she put on a longer dress. These girls, coming from the slightly staid English school in the city, might think her exposure rude.</p>
<p>Laureen&rsquo;s warning to Lynn had about the same effect on her as it would had she said, &ldquo;You are wearing a watch on your wrist.&rdquo; Lynn just did not understand why it should be a problem. Then she remembered what I had told her, so she just smiled at Laureen and said, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roy might see,&rdquo; I heard Laureen whisper. Obviously this girl didn&rsquo;t know me at all.</p>
<p>Lynn looked quite bemused again. Then she said again, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Roy doesn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; And she lifted her skirt up casually for a moment to show Laureen more of what she was wearing.</p>
<p>I pretended I had heard nothing of this, as I responded to Shelley&rsquo;s extravagant affection. Then, as if the last twenty seconds had not been enough, one of her friends spotted the little plastic dog I have on the handlebars of my bicycle. She squatted down on her haunches to have a closer look, giving me a clear view up her bright red skirt. She was wearing light blue panties, a couple of sizes too large, so I could see the sweet rounded curve of her bottom underneath as the leg openings hung down.</p>
<p>This was a girl I had not met before, but I soon learned that her name was Nicky. After I had gazed at her panties for a few seconds, I looked at the rest of her, and saw a real little beauty. This is the sort of girl you might see advertising soap or something in long-ago advertisements. She has wide blue eyes and her golden hair hangs down over her shoulders in natural curls. She has charming little dimples when she smiles and a lovely clear skin but, best of all, she seems completely unaware of her beauty.</p>
<p>Shelley pulled me to my feet and said, &ldquo;You must meet my friends.&rdquo; Most of them I knew by name, but little more. Shelley and I like to be alone together where we can enjoy our nudity without any intrusions, and as far as I knew girls at the English school were not into nudity. Now I know a little better. Besides, the English school is full of embassy children who move on every few years, while we live in the city permanently, so we have to get used to a quick turn-over of friends.</p>
<p>That difficulty has also drawn us closer together. Since I am in the senior school and Shelley in the junior, I don&rsquo;t meet her friends at school.</p>
<p>I saw that they all had soaking wet hair, so I knew they must have been swimming before lunch, and very recently. I wondered if they had been swimming naked, as our families do. Then I realized that probably they had, as they would not have had their swimming costumes with them. I wondered how they felt about that, now that they had tried it perhaps for the first time.</p>
<p>Shelley later told me that they had indeed been swimming naked, encouraged by Aunt Sue, who had herself been the first to strip off on this hot day and plunge into the pool. Some of the other girls, Shelley said, had been very reluctant to swim naked outdoors, but in the end they had all given in. As Lynn and I had been in the middle of our lunch, Aunt Sue had gone inside, still naked, to prepare lunch, and that&rsquo;s when she had the telephone call about her friend. She came out to tell the girls, and that was when Shelley had made the suggestion that Lynn and I come over to look after them.</p>
<p>According to Shelley, consternation broke out among her naked friends as Aunt Sue went indoors to phone us. Panic-stricken that I might be coming through the gate at any moment, they leapt out of the pool with one accord, scrambling for their clothes and pulling them on before they had even dried themselves. Shelley had not planned to dress at all, but her friends eventually persuaded her to do so. She took her time, and then walked with them round the back of the house towards the driveway to wait for us. Just at that moment, we had cycled round the corner into the &lsquo;ambush&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Shelley introduced her friends to me. Laureen was still standing next to Lynn, struck dumb by Lynn&rsquo;s complete lack of inhibition about her underwear. Laureen is the tallest of the girls, slender but somehow elegant, with shoulder-length fair hair and a very wide row of teeth when she smiles - often a rather cheeky smile. She was wearing a white top and a bright orange and yellow skirt that swung down to her knees - but, as I was to find out, she could be quite careless with it.</p>
<p>All the girls, in fact, were wearing pretty dresses or skirts that day, having expected to go on a very special visit. My heart warmed as I took in their combined beauty. Young girls naked look most beautiful of all - as long as it is natural and uninhibited, not showing off. Next to that, I enjoy the beauty of their underwear or their skirts and dresses. I do not believe shorts or jeans look good on any girl; they make their bodies look misshapen instead of enhancing them. To me, it takes their sex away from them.</p>
<p>Laureen I immediately felt a bit doubtful about. She looked to me as if she could be a little too precocious. I thought I would have to go carefully with her.</p>
<p>I was introduced to Nicky, still crouching to look at my plastic dog, and a couple of the other girls bent over to look at it too. When they looked up again I was introduced to Angela and Rebecca.</p>
<p>Angela is small, quiet and quite pretty, with light brown hair and wide blue eyes. She was wearing a sky-blue blouse and skirt, which matched her eyes perfectly. She looked at me almost out of the corners of her eyes and smiled slightly, without opening her lips, her cheeks showing a flush of pink as she did so. &ldquo;This girl likes me,&rdquo; I thought with some amusement. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want me to know, but she isn&rsquo;t very clever at hiding her secret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca is very friendly and likeable. She has an English father and a Spanish mother, and I later heard she was the first of Shelley&rsquo;s friends to swim naked that morning - due, no doubt, to the Spanish mother&rsquo;s influence. Even today, the Europeans are much more relaxed about nudity than the British. She is an interesting chatterbox, and very enthusiastic about everything. She has dark brown hair, brown eyes and a slightly olive skin, but apart from that looks more English than Spanish. She was wearing a beautiful white blouse, looking rather Spanish with its frills around the shoulders, and a dark blue pleated skirt.</p>
<p>We all almost forgot the final girl in the group, standing at the back.</p>
<p>This was Tina, small, with light brown hair and blue eyes, and a rather pale face that I did not think very attractive. She was wearing a pale pink dress and hardly smiled or looked at me. She looked like a shy little mouse, and not a very happy one either.</p>
<p>Then I introduced Lynn to the girls. She had now dismounted and was standing next to her bicycle, so she was not shocking the girls with her panties any longer, although I did see them glancing at her short skirt with rather mixed expressions on their faces. But they did take to her quickly and crowded round her, asking her about Denmark and sometimes causing her difficulty by talking so quickly it was hard for her to understand.</p>
<p>After a couple of minutes Shelley reminded us that it was lunch time and I had been elected to prepare it for them. No, they did not know what they had been going to eat but were sure I could handle the situation. Shelley led the way into the house through the kitchen door.</p>
<p>We entered the house and trooped through to the kitchen. I was relieved to see a number of hamburgers and rolls laid out on the kitchen table; no doubt Aunt Sue had been just about to cook these in the microwave when the telephone rang. I found some margarine in the fridge and began to butter the rolls while the girls, forgetting me, plied Lynn with questions. I did say forgetting me, but Angela did not, every now and then shooting glances at me out of the corner of her eye and then blushing most attractively when she realized I had seen her. I encouraged her quietly with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you meet Roy?&rdquo; Rebecca wanted to know. So Lynn told them the story, in rather hesitant English. I wasn&rsquo;t sure the girls should hear all this, but Lynn was quite unconcerned.</p>
<p>The previous summer Lynn had gone with her family on holiday to a nudist beach in France, the famous Cap D&rsquo;Agde, where they coated themselves in sun cream and spent most of their time lying in the sun.</p>
<p>One afternoon, the rest of the family - Lynn&rsquo;s parents and her younger brother - decided to go to the nearby shopping centre. Lynn was quite happy to stay on the beach, so they left all their belongings with her while she lay on her back in a lounger and sunbathed.</p>
<p>She suddenly opened her eyes with a start, and had a very nasty shock.</p>
<p>She had felt a hand tickling her pubic hair. I should say that Lynn has quite a mat of hair downstairs, despite being only my age; in fact, she has more than I do. As I tell her, though, I need to keep mine cut rather short as in the hot weather thick hair becomes very itchy for me when I sweat, and in non-nudist places that is not considered an ideal place to scratch. Lynn&rsquo;s is thick and light brown, though, so it is actually scarcely possible to see her vagina for it.</p>
<p>She looked up to see a stocky boy of about 15 with an ugly face and a half-erect penis leering at her. He spoke to her in French, which she barely understood, and she did not know what he was wanting, except that it was not pleasant. As he reached his hand out again, she cowered back and tried to call for help, but her voice stuck in her throat. Not that it might have done any good, as the beach was crowded, but nobody around seemed to be taking the slightest notice of this boy&rsquo;s lechery and Lynn&rsquo;s predicament.</p>
<p>The girls were greatly shocked by the story so far. They showed little surprise at the news that Lynn had been on a nudist beach, but then they had found out that morning, if they hadn&rsquo;t known before, that Shelley&rsquo;s family were nudists. But they gave little gasps of horror and fell deadly silent when Lynn told them how she had been touched in her most private place. I could see from the corner of my eye some of them shooting glances at me, obviously thinking that I shouldn&rsquo;t be there to listen to this, but I kept my eyes firmly on the rolls I was buttering as if I hadn&rsquo;t heard a word.</p>
<p>This is where I come into the story. I was walking along at that time, exploring the beach, as we also holiday there some years. Then I saw this lout with a stubby grizzly weapon sticking up between his legs, bending over a girl who at first glance appeared to be only about Shelley&rsquo;s age. She looked quite terrified, and it was obvious that he was about to do something indecent to her and that there was nobody to stop him. Nobody except me, that is.</p>
<p>I think it was the fact that Lynn&rsquo;s apparent size reminded me of Shelley that suddenly filled me with anger; had anybody treated my little cousin in this way, I would certainly have been uncontrollably furious. I grabbed the older boy roughly by the shoulder. He swung round and moved back straight away, probably thinking it was the girl&rsquo;s father come to rescue her. Then he saw it was only I, half a head shorter and perhaps two years younger than he, and he immediately became aggressive. He started swearing at me, but I cut him short.</p>
<p>Clenching my fists and very angry, I glared at him in fury. &ldquo;Get out of this before I smash your face in!&rdquo; I remember saying in a determined hiss.</p>
<p>People nearby were now starting to take notice with the possibility of a fight looming, and I suspect it was this rather than any real fear of me that made him back off. I took a step towards him, fists clenched and ready to fight for my life should he try to land the first blow. He backed away as I repeated, &ldquo;Get out! Just get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking flustered, he glanced at Lynn, still cowering at the far end of her lounger, and then back at me. I took another step towards him and repeated my demand. He spat at me, snarled in French, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back!&rdquo; then turned on his heel and stalked off with as much dignity as he could muster.</p>
<p>I saw him off, and then turned to look at Lynn, softening as I did so.</p>
<p>She still looked like a little child, but I could see her rounded breasts and mat of pubic hair as she opened her legs to draw her knees under her. She had short fair hair and blue eyes with rather an intense look, and freckles on her cheeks. I did not think she was especially beautiful, and in honesty I still don&rsquo;t. But she made me feel a man, and she has trusted me deeply from that day onward, and that is why I have loved her ever since.</p>
<p>She is indeed nearer Shelley&rsquo;s height than my own, small and sweet, although only a month younger than I am. She looked as white as a sheet and was trembling all over. I found myself trembling as well from the shock of it all. I am not an aggressive sort of person and I was amazed to recall how I handled this incident. Had I not been so furious, I could not have done it.</p>
<p>I made sure the lout continued on his way and then sat down gently on the far end of the lounger. I didn&rsquo;t want to get any closer in case I frightened her any more. Lynn kept staring at me, as if turned to stone. I didn&rsquo;t know whether she understood English or not; fortunately she knew enough for us to be able to talk to each other. &ldquo;What did he do to you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Lynn said nothing for a moment, then looked along the beach at the disappearing back of the lout. Then she whispered, &ldquo;He touch me - there,&rdquo; and pointed between her legs. She looked back along the beach again, and suddenly scrambled along the lounger to sit right beside me, leaning against me. Slowly and gently I put my arm round her. She was stiff and trembling. Then suddenly the dam burst. She buried her face in her hands and burst into deep sobbing, her back heaving as she tried to suppress the sound.</p>
<p>I just held her gently and waited. After about a minute the heaving settled down. Slowly she sat upright, still leaning against me, and turned to look at me with teary eyes. &ldquo;You saved me,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She put her hands on my cheeks and planted a kiss on my mouth. I smiled at her and responded.</p>
<p>After a short silence she looked up at me and said, in her Danish accent, &ldquo;Please. Can you stay a time? Stay till my father comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew she was afraid of the lout returning, and so was I. Perhaps he had gone to fetch some of his friends. But I told myself that he was hardly likely to come back looking for a fight in a public place. I knew I couldn&rsquo;t leave her until she knew she was safe. I hadn&rsquo;t been going anywhere in particular, but was merely exploring along the beach after lunch while my parents and sister rested in the chalets.</p>
<p>So I stayed, and we talked. She kept looking over her shoulder, in the direction the lout had taken, so we turned round to face that way. But he didn&rsquo;t return and we were both relieved that we never saw him again.</p>
<p>We had got to know each other quite well, with her still leaning against my shoulder and her hand on my knee, and me with my arm round her back, when she looked up and smiled for the first time. &ldquo;My father and my mother,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>A tall man and a short woman, together with a boy of about twelve, were approaching and looking at me rather suspiciously, no doubt wondering what I was doing with my arm round their daughter. But Lynn stood up and broke out into a torrent of Danish, obviously telling them all about me. At first they looked angry, then concerned, and finally the parents looked towards me and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for being good to our daughter,&rdquo; they said. They had brought some food back from the shops with them, and invited me to join them. I had already eaten, though, and Lynn didn&rsquo;t feel like eating, so we didn&rsquo;t eat much, but I was happy to stay and talk with them. Soon they were treating me like one of the family, and they were certainly very grateful to me.</p>
<p>After a while I said I would like them to meet my own family, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure where they would be. They would surely have finished their siesta by now, but I didn&rsquo;t know where they would go after that. We had just arranged to meet back for the evening meal at seven o&rsquo;clock. So I suggested I went and found them, then brought them to meet Lynn&rsquo;s family. I asked if Lynn might like to come with me.</p>
<p>They all agreed, and her father said to me, &ldquo;Buy an ice cream for you on the way. Please keep the change.&rdquo; He handed me a massive currency bill that I couldn&rsquo;t possibly spend all at once.</p>
<p>I thought we would start looking for my family at our chalets. We had a quick dip in the sea, then trudged up the beach. On the way we passed a track where some teenagers on motorised scooters were skidding back and forth on the sand. We kept a sharp lookout for the thug, but he was not there. As we passed a large damp patch of sand just down from the showers, a scooter skidded in front of us. As the wheels failed to grip, it sprayed us with damp sand.</p>
<p>We were pretty annoyed, especially as the gentleman responsible scooted off without even an apology. As we were already wet from the sea, a lot of the sand stuck to our faces and bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we can wash it off in the showers at our chalet,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Within a minute we were there, but my family was not. I had the key to the chalet I shared with Jenny, my sister, in a small bag I had been carrying around with me, so I opened the door to let us in.</p>
<p>It was very hot inside, and Lynn gasped with the heat. Nothing would feel better now than a cold shower, so we headed for the bathroom at the back. Lynn decided she needed to use the toilet, showing no shyness as she sat down and urinated while I turned on the shower right in front of her.</p>
<p>I stepped into the shower and was washing off when Lynn finished. It felt great! I reached out a hand and gently pulled her into the shower with me. It was a small cubicle, intended only for one person, so we had to stand pressed right up against each other. That felt even better, with the cold water streaming down on us and our naked bodies in close contact. I put my arms around her while she nestled her head against my shoulder blade. I kissed her gently and shivered as I could feel her pubic hair against my penis. Only the coldness of the water prevented me from getting a hard-on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long we stayed like that, but eventually the water began to splutter and dry up. I turned off the tap, reached for the towels and threw them over the nearer of the two beds, my own. Then I flung myself on top, on my back, and stretched out my arms for Lynn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; I urged her.</p>
<p>She looked at me with rather mixed emotions, presumably wondering if I was intending to have sex with her and afraid of it. I smiled gently up at her. &ldquo;Let me promise you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I will never, ever do anything to you that you don&rsquo;t want me to.&rdquo; And I have kept that promise. Not only with Lynn, but with all girls. I get what I want in the end, the nice way!</p>
<p>Shyly she lowered herself between my arms, to lie on my chest. Our faces, cold from the shower, were cheek by cheek to each other, and hers was so lovely and soft. I could feel her little breasts against my chest and her heart thumping rapidly through them. A year later, they had grown quite a bit. Again I could feel her soft pubic hair on my hip, and my penis started to respond, but I controlled my actions. We just lay there for a long, long time, whispering to each other and fondling, with myself careful to make sure she was happy with what I was doing.</p>
<p>I had never stroked a girl in her private area before, but Lynn seemed to want me to do it, perhaps to make up for the way in which the lout had abused her there earlier on. I was very gentle, just enjoying the soft furry feel of her as she lay on her back across my chest and closed her eyes, a dreamy smile playing across her face. Occasionally she shuddered and then laughed, obviously with happiness. It must have had a healing effect on her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad Lynn didn&rsquo;t tell Shelley and her friends about this part. I&rsquo;m glad she didn&rsquo;t tell her parents, either, as they might have changed their opinion of me and our lives would have been different. In the end we found my parents walking on the beach, and introduced them to Lynn&rsquo;s parents. They got on well, and the end result was that this year, at my parents&rsquo; invitation, they arranged for Lynn to fly over and spend a month of her summer holidays with us, the official reason being so that we could help her speak English better!</p>
<p>I had been so long without her, and it was great to discover that she was as happy to see me again as I was to see her. We had kept in touch by letter, and she wrote some very long ones, but it wasn&rsquo;t the same.</p>
<p>When we met her at the airport, she just ran up and flung her arms round my neck, kissing me so lovingly and wetting my face with her tears. Shelley, who was with me, was rather jealous, and when Lynn finally let go she piled on me for her turn.</p>
<p>It was a great feeling to be so loved by two girls, although in different ways, as I always counted Shelley as family. Now, as I stood in the kitchen listening to Lynn speaking of me as a hero and seeing from the corner of my eye Shelley&rsquo;s friends gazing at me in admiration, I told myself that I would have a few more before very much longer.</p>
<h5 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#chapter-2">#</a></h5>
<p>&ldquo;You were so brave, Roy,&rdquo; said Nicky, smiling up at me after Lynn had finished her story of how we had met.</p>
<p>All the girls were gazing at me in admiration and I was feeling rather embarrassed. &ldquo;Well, there are some things you have to do,&rdquo; I said rather awkwardly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad I was there at the right time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shelley rescued me from my awkwardness with her suggestion. She stood in front of me with her chest out and hands folded together in front of her, her usual pose. &ldquo;Roy, may I show them that photograph of you and me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, fine,&rdquo; I agreed. I knew which one she meant. Aunt Sue kept several photo albums, many of them showing the family unclothed, and in the front of one was a brilliant large photograph of Shelley and me, side by side, arms round each other and wearing only our smiles. It was Shelley&rsquo;s favorite, and she wanted to have it framed and put on display in their lounge, but Aunt Sue said that some visitors might be offended by it.</p>
<p>Shelley came straight back from the lounge with the photo album and opened it up for the girls, who crowded round to have a look. It would be interesting, I thought, to see what effect it would have on these non-nudist girls.</p>
<p>Sure enough, as they saw the photo - or rather, the part of the photo containing me - they gasped, took a step back and their hands flew to their faces. No doubt they had seen smaller boys naked, or family members, but in the rather old-fashioned English school we all attended in the city, there would be no chance of any nakedness between sexes.</p>
<p>I have always been rather glad I have a normal penis, although had I been more like Lynn it would probably not have bothered me at all what sort of equipment I possessed. Nudists seem to accept each other, even if there are peculiarities in the genital area. Non-nudists seem to pick up differences. Too small, and they giggle. Too large, and you hear exclamations of &ldquo;Gross!&rdquo; In this case, they were just startled at seeing a nude picture of me when they had not expected it.</p>
<p>I often wonder what girls like these would have said had they had the chance to see Pete of the school senior football team in the changing rooms. He is 17, not very tall, but he has a penis that hangs down most of the way to his knees. Nudists like myself don&rsquo;t worry about things like that, but others make comments, such as the one usually heard as he makes his way to the showers: &ldquo;Careful you don&rsquo;t trip over it, Pete!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we go swimming, Pete has great difficulty in keeping it inside his swimming costume. Sometimes we can see the end sticking out at the top just below his belly button, and his friends warn him if there are girls around and make dirty comments if there are not. If he becomes aroused, no costume can hold it. I hate the stupidity of a world that makes an issue of things like that, and felt glad that Shelley&rsquo;s friends had at least been educated a bit in the pool that morning.</p>
<p>Pete is very proud of his appendage, and in the school they still tell a story of what he did in the fourth grade. The class were doing practical measuring of their bodies in mathematics, using their rulers, and writing down such items as, &ldquo;My foot is so-many centimeters long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Pete&rsquo;s entries read, &ldquo;My piss is 16 centimeters long.&rdquo; It earned him a very painful interview with the headmaster.</p>
<p>The girls really seemed startled to see a naked photograph of me, and amazed that I didn&rsquo;t mind. In fact, Laureen asked me, an expression of wonder on her face, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mind us seeing you naked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; I replied casually, smiling and shrugging my shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not going to see me naked,&rdquo; she replied defiantly, tossing her head back and swirling her skirt around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s fine, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I smiled. &ldquo;We all have free choice in this place.&rdquo; But I felt like saying, &ldquo;Want a bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the girls were still looking rather embarrassed by the photo, although Rebecca was paging through the album. Nicky obviously thought it was time to change the subject, as she turned to Shelley and asked, &ldquo;Shelley, may we play with your dressing-up box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shelley, perhaps rather strangely for a nudist, loves dressing up, and over the years she has gathered a large collection of clothes and costumes, helped in her hobby by Aunt Sue. She and her friends often play at dressing up when they visit her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; agreed the others, all following Shelley out of the kitchen towards the front door. All the costumes were stored in a little playhouse in the front garden.</p>
<p>As they went, Rebecca turned back, stretched out a hand towards Lynn and said appealingly, &ldquo;Lynn, come with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynn looked at me, so I smiled and said, &ldquo;Go and have a look while I prepare lunch; you&rsquo;ll find it interesting.&rdquo; She followed Rebecca out, leaving me alone to put the hamburgers into the microwave.</p>
<p>Once I had done that, I discovered that I was not actually quite alone after all. Glancing into the dining room, I saw the little Tina sitting there by herself, staring into space. That was rather puzzling behavior, I thought.</p>
<p>While I was waiting, I wandered into the dining room and sat down at the end of the table, next to Tina. She hardly looked at me. &ldquo;Are you feeling sick?&rdquo; I asked gently after a pause.</p>
<p>She shook her head and continued to stare into space. I waited, but she said nothing more. So I asked, &ldquo;Have you had a quarrel with the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this her face suddenly crumpled and tears began to run down her cheeks. She still said nothing, though, so I asked her, &ldquo;Do you want to talk about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she shook her head, and continued to cry quietly. &ldquo;I want to go home,&rdquo; was all she whispered. I moved my chair closer, stretched out my arm and put it on her far shoulder, with just a little gentle pressure to give her the chance to come to me or keep to herself as she chose.</p>
<p>It seemed to be the right thing to do, as she pushed herself off her chair and almost fell lightly into my arms, still crying.</p>
<p>I pulled her up on to my lap; she was only small and light. She put an arm round my neck and cried into my shirt, the tears quickly soaking through to my chest. I held her gently and waited until she had finished crying.</p>
<p>Then she looked at me and decided to explain. &ldquo;We went for a swim this morning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t have our costumes.&rdquo; She stopped and sniffed. I waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others went swimming naked,&rdquo; she went on after a pause. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t want to do that. Angela and I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She stopped and sniffed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others all told us to go and join them,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;And then Angela went, but I don&rsquo;t think she wanted to very much. I asked to borrow Shelley&rsquo;s school costume. But they wouldn&rsquo;t let me. They wouldn&rsquo;t let me swim in my panties, either. They made me go in naked when I told them I didn&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo; The tears began to flow again.</p>
<p>I shook my head silently. The problems it causes when children have been encouraged to be shy about their bodies! &ldquo;But what about Aunt Sue - Shelley&rsquo;s mum?&rdquo; I asked. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine her forcing anybody to swim naked, although she might encourage them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She just told me not to be so wet,&rdquo; whispered Tina, wiping away further tears.</p>
<p>Well, I could imagine my aunt calling that out in her loud voice, but I was quite sure it was said with a big smile on her face and that she would not have meant to put too much pressure on little Tina. Tina must just have misunderstood her. I tried to tell Tina that, but she broke in and said, &ldquo;All the others were shouting at me and they made me do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure what had happened there, but I said in a firm voice, &ldquo;Well, that was very wrong of them. I promise you that as long as I&rsquo;m here, nobody will force you to do anything you don&rsquo;t want to do. If they try, I&rsquo;ll shut them up straight away. I promise you&rsquo;ll be safe with me.&rdquo; Looking down at her rather plain face, I felt a sudden rush of affection for this sad little girl, and felt all I wanted to do was to protect her, much as I had done about Lynn on that beach a year earlier.</p>
<p>This seemed to reassure her. She put her hands round my neck, looked at me properly for the first time and tried to smile. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t seem to want to move, so we just sat there in silence for maybe half a minute. The microwave had done its job, but I enjoyed the experience of a trusting little girl on my lap. I wouldn&rsquo;t let her down. I think I must be a sucker for helpless females, but they give me so much in return.</p>
<p>Outside I could hear the noise of the other girls as they played with the dressing-up clothes. Then Tina looked at me and said, &ldquo;If we go swimming again, what should I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you to choose completely,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If you want to wear Shelley&rsquo;s costume or swim in your panties, or not swim at all, you do it, and I won&rsquo;t let anybody even talk to you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, do you think I should swim naked?&rdquo; she asked me.</p>
<p>I felt surprised, as it seemed as if she was coming round to the idea now. I answered, &ldquo;Well, I think it would be a good idea to join in with your friends if they all swim naked, but that&rsquo;s completely up to you.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll want to swim naked with me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tina looked thoughtful and then asked, &ldquo;Will you swim naked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to do that,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know whether I will, because it might make some of the others feel bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tina smiled again and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind.&rdquo; After a few seconds she said, &ldquo;Lunch should be ready now.&rdquo; She slipped off my knee and said, &ldquo;Come and see what the others are doing first.&rdquo; She took my hand and led me through the lounge to the front door.</p>
<p>It was quite noisy outside as the girls were excitedly playing at dressing up. The playhouse was much too small for them all to change inside, so they had spread the masses of clothes out on the grass under the tree next to it. The garden was completely hedged round, so nobody from outside could see them, otherwise they would surely have found somewhere else to change.</p>
<p>As I came out of the front door with Tina holding my hand, I could see girls in various stages of undress as they tried on the costumes. Lynn was down to her bra and panties, about to try on a long evening dress, perhaps almost for the first time in her life. I caught a glimpse of Laureen wearing her skirt but nothing on top, before she saw me come out and squealed, clutching her costume to her chest to cover it. This alerted the other girls, and Angela and Nicky, also half-dressed, covered up quickly and giggled.</p>
<p>I knew the best way to act was to show I wasn&rsquo;t interested and then leave them to dress again as soon as possible. So I just said, &ldquo;Lunch is all ready, so do you want to come inside for it or shall I bring it outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside,&rdquo; I heard several voices say, including Shelley. I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before as I was so used to it, but she was quite naked, about to try on a tiny bikini.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, I&rsquo;ll bring it out in five minutes,&rdquo; I said, turning to go back inside. Tina released my hand and went over to join the others with the clothes, which pleased me, as it meant she was joining in again.</p>
<p>As I went inside, I heard Shelley&rsquo;s voice say, &ldquo;Girls, we mustn&rsquo;t wear these costumes during lunch because we mustn&rsquo;t get them dirty or sticky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I waited in the kitchen for five minutes, setting out the food and plates on a large tray, along with some plastic cups and a glass of lemonade. Then I went to the front door and called out, &ldquo;May I come out now?&rdquo; I knew the most important thing at this stage of my relationship with those girls was to show that I could be trusted to respect their privacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the voices in reply, so I walked out with the tray. The girls were all dressed in their usual clothes again, except for Shelley, who was still slipping her dress over her head. And there was Tina, standing there in rather worn, off-white panties, about to put her dress on, and it was clear that she wanted me to see her like this.</p>
<p>It was probably just her way of showing me her love and trust, and I wondered, after what she had said to me inside, if she would also be willing to let me see her swimming naked. Her little body was quite white and flat, apart from her ribs showing clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall we have it?&rdquo; I asked the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat it in the tree house,&rdquo; suggested Shelley.</p>
<p>She has a large tree in her front garden in which her father built her a tree house, but I didn&rsquo;t think it would be large enough for all of us to have lunch together, and I said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try, anyway,&rdquo; said Shelley, leading the way to the ladder. Still holding the tray, I followed them over to the ladder and stood at the bottom while they climbed, without realizing that they were giving me a lovely display of panties as they went up.</p>
<p>First went Shelley, and to see those lovely white woolen panties while her short blue skirt rode up with every rung of the ladder she mounted warmed my heart, as it never fails to do. Then came Rebecca, silky white panties with little colored patterns across them; Nicky, with her loose pale-blue panties; and Tina, with her rather threadbare pair.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t seen Angela&rsquo;s before: plain white cotton and attractive to my eyes. Lynn followed them up, and with her very short skirt I could see all the way up to her belly button very easily.</p>
<p>Laureen didn&rsquo;t follow them up. She explained to me rather pertly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to go up; there&rsquo;s not enough room up there.&rdquo; I wondered if she had guessed that I might have seen their panties. I later found out that she had another reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please hold the tray for me, then,&rdquo; I asked, handing it over to her.</p>
<p>Rather taken by surprise, she accepted it, and I climbed briskly up the ladder to the top.</p>
<p>As I expected, all the girls were squashed rather tightly inside and there was clearly not enough room to eat a meal. Tina was sitting on the far side, knees up and apart, pretending to be unaware of the fact that she was revealing her panties to me again. The others were sitting squashed up close together, cross-legged with their arms around each other, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a splinter in my bottom,&rdquo; announced Shelley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll just have to eat under the trees,&rdquo; said Rebecca. So I led the way down again, with Rebecca&rsquo;s skirt flapping attractively just above my head all the way. I was now close enough to see that the patterns on her panties were of little red and blue teddy bears.</p>
<p>I was just taking the tray from Laureen when I heard a squeal and a bump behind me, and then squeals from the other girls. &ldquo;Oh, sorry, Angela!&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; &ldquo;What happened, Angela?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning round, I saw Angela lying on her side at the bottom of the ladder, struggling to get up. The others helped her to her feet. There were tears in her eyes and she looked shaken, but didn&rsquo;t cry. I could see that she was wearing some rather high-heeled shoes, probably from the costume box. They were hardly suitable for climbing, and she must have slipped and fallen from a couple of yards or more up the ladder.</p>
<p>Shelley led Angela over to me straight away. I put the tray down, knelt down and put my arm round her waist. She was too shocked to blush this time. &ldquo;Where are you hurt?&rdquo; I asked her gently.</p>
<p>The other girls were still all talking at once, so I only just heard her reply. &ldquo;My wrist,&rdquo; she whispered, holding a limp right wrist in front of my nose. A single tear trickled down her cheek. &ldquo;I landed on my wrist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I held her arm gently and told her to move her fingers, which she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be broken, so it&rsquo;s probably just a bit bruised or strained,&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll probably stop hurting soon.&rdquo; I smiled at her and rubbed her waist gently with my other arm, feeling the elastic waist of her panties under my fingers.</p>
<p>As I rose to my feet again, Shelley said to me, with a rather cheeky smile, &ldquo;Roy, aren&rsquo;t you going to kiss her better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why didn&rsquo;t I think of that?&rdquo; I reproached myself silently. It was an old family joke, and whenever Shelley hurt herself, or pretended to, it was my job to kiss her better. But I just said, &ldquo;Well, if Angela wants me to.&rdquo; I smiled down at her.</p>
<p>Angela looked up, rather startled, and blushed a little as she so often did. I thought she was going to say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; but instead she whispered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I was just putting it down to shyness and turning away from her when she suddenly changed her mind and said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knelt down next to her and laughed. &ldquo;No - yes?&rdquo; I teased her. &ldquo;How do you expect me to know what you really mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angela blushed again and then repeated, in the smallest whisper, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I agreed, putting on a funny tone of voice to make her giggle. &ldquo;Where would your ladyship like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her left cheek towards me and pointed with her finger to the middle. &ldquo;There.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I planted a warm kiss on the exact spot and rose to my feet, smiling, as she broke into a beautiful smile and turned away to try and hide it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are, it always works,&rdquo; I told them all. Some of the others were looking a bit jealous, and some very surprised. As I got to know Angela better, I later realized that they were surprised that she should agree, because usually she is a girl who likes to play it cool and pretend she doesn&rsquo;t have feelings. In that case, it&rsquo;s a pity she hasn&rsquo;t told her face about it, because it can be very expressive when she is taken by surprise or uncertain about things.</p>
<p>I was about to pick up the tray again when Shelley said, &ldquo;Roy, my bottom hurts. I got a splinter in it in the tree house.&rdquo; She turned around, lifted her skirt and stuck out her panties at me. &ldquo;There.&rdquo; She pointed to the spot.</p>
<p>I pulled the material down and had a look, but could see nothing sticking into her cute bottom. Then, when I examined the panties more carefully, I found a little splinter of wood that I pulled out and threw away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss better,&rdquo; she instructed me, sticking her bare bottom out at me again. If we had been alone, I would have kissed the spot in fun, but I thought her friends might be shocked, or giggle in a silly way, especially Laureen, who I now knew could be very silly at times. So I just patted it and kissed her gently on the cheek.</p>
<p>Carrying the tray again, I led the way towards my favorite tree near the swimming pool. For some reason, boys don&rsquo;t seem able to sit cross- legged as easily as girls, and I liked this tree to lean back on. I put the tray down in front of me and the girls sat around. Tina sneaked in on one side of me, while Shelley claimed her place on the other side.</p>
<p>The other girls sat round in a circle, with Angela standing still for a moment before sitting almost opposite me. Again her face told its own story of an amusing mixture of feelings. Half of it said, &ldquo;I wish I could sit next to Roy.&rdquo; The other half said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the others to know I wish I could sit next to Roy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was Lynn again, sitting carelessly cross-legged with her skirt up and open. Then my heart almost skipped a beat as Laureen sat down beside her. More careful than Lynn, she sat down opposite me, pushing her skirt down with her hand as she did so to make quite sure I couldn&rsquo;t see beneath. She sat on a twig, though, and lifted her left thigh to remove it from underneath. As she did so, I had a momentary glimpse up her skirt, and for a split second saw a pink bulge between her legs, where her panties should have been. Laureen was not wearing any panties! So that was why she had not wanted to climb the ladder to the tree house! Had she lost them or deliberately left them off that day?</p>
<p>Of course I said nothing, but Laureen seemed to stay very conscious of her vulnerability and kept her skirt firmly down over her ankles. I kept watching her out of the corner of my eye. She leaned forward to take a hamburger, reaching out with her right hand while her left remained over her skirt. Then she did the same with the lemonade. I felt sad for her. Nudists do not have to worry about that sort of thing at all, but these girls did not have that freedom.</p>
<p>We sat and talked while we ate, although Lynn and I just shared a small hamburger, having eaten one lunch already. Most of the conversation was about the clothes box, and the girls were keen to spend some more time there after the meal.</p>
<p>In the middle of lunch, Rebecca suddenly farted, not very loudly. She said, &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t seem embarrassed by it - the Spanish upbringing again, I should think - but some of the other girls giggled, especially Laureen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, giggling is silly,&rdquo; I told them, trying to look suitably disgusted by their behavior. &ldquo;That sort of thing doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rsquo;&rdquo; Laureen mimicked me. &ldquo;Nothing matters? Doesn&rsquo;t anything matter, Roy?&rdquo; She looked at me with a challenging smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not about people&rsquo;s bodies,&rdquo; I answered, rather sternly, trying to put to best effect my superior age and my position as being in charge of them all. &ldquo;Suppose it was you who farted, or suppose a boy saw your panties or saw you naked or going to the toilet, or something like that. Do you want him to think it doesn&rsquo;t matter, or that it does matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laureen, no doubt thinking of her own pantiless situation, went rather red, looked down hard at her hamburger, shrugged her shoulders and muttered, &ldquo;That it doesn&rsquo;t matter, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m in charge, I won&rsquo;t let anybody be rude about things that don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; I sounded like a teacher, I suppose, but I really believe that, even though when I say it I also hope secretly to soften them up so they won&rsquo;t mind showing me those things they usually keep private. By acting casual and clamping down on anything that might cause embarrassment, I make them feel safe with me - and they truly are safe with me. As I said before, I will never do anything to a girl that she doesn&rsquo;t want me to do. I just try to work patiently to make her want me to do it.</p>
<p>Some of the rolls were rather crumbly, and as Laureen pushed the last piece into her mouth it fell apart. Since her lips were wet with lemonade, she had crumbs sticking all over her mouth. There were no napkins, of course, and she forgot herself for one glorious moment.</p>
<p>Without thinking she lifted the hem of her dress to wipe her mouth, and I had a ring-side view right from her bottom almost to her belly button. The soft pink lips of her vagina, spread apart to reveal deeper pink folds of flesh inside as she had her legs crossed, filled my gaze.</p>
<p>I could make out no hair there yet, but had only a second to enjoy my good fortune before she suddenly remembered and pushed her skirt back down hard. She shot me a sharp glance to see if I had noticed anything, but I had already shifted my eyes elsewhere.</p>
<p>My heart was singing and my loins felt deliciously warm. The sight of naked girls does not particularly excite me in itself, although I find it a quiet pleasure and appreciate their naked beauty and their trust.</p>
<p>But getting a glimpse of the forbidden unexpectedly really turns me on.</p>
<p>I felt very tender now towards Laureen, having seen her humanity, her vulnerability, and got away with it.</p>
<p>One amusing thing that happened during our lunch was that Nicky thought she saw a spider on a branch of the tree to my left, and threw a plastic cup at it. She missed by quite a long way, and there was a lot of giggling. As we got up after lunch, with Laureen pressing down on her skirt very firmly as she rose, I walked round the tree to fetch it.</p>
<p>Nearby something on the ground caught my eye. It looked like a piece of pink cloth. I picked it up, to discover it was a pair of pale pink panties, with neat lacing round the legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, those are Laureen&rsquo;s!&rdquo; burst out Shelley. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t find them when we were getting dressed after swimming this morning. Laureen!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve found your panties!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laureen came round the tree, looking a little red in the face, and almost snatched them from me, saying &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; as she did so. I could tell she did not mean to be rude, but was feeling embarrassed. Nudists don&rsquo;t worry about that sort of thing, but Laureen didn&rsquo;t have the good fortune of that type of background. As she slipped them over her bare feet and pulled them up under her skirt, I smiled at her and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right; it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once she had her panties on again she seemed to recover her natural cheek. She was still a little red in the face, but she tried to smile back and said, &ldquo;I put them in the tree when I went swimming and the wind must have blown them down. Then she added saucily, &ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t see my pussy at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way she said it made it clear that she was sure that I hadn&rsquo;t, although perhaps she was just trying to make certain. But I didn&rsquo;t put her straight on that. I just smiled again, shrugged my shoulders and said, &ldquo;Laureen, if I had, I promise you I would never think or say anything bad to you. To me, this sort of thing doesn&rsquo;t matter. We&rsquo;re nudists in our family and we don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I walked over to collect the lunch tray, leaving her to think about it. I heard her muttering behind me, &ldquo;Yes, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<h5 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#chapter-3">#</a></h5>
<p>Let&rsquo;s play dressing up again,&rdquo; I heard Rebecca call to the others as I carried the lunch tray into the house. I also went to the toilet, quite a relief as the excitement of Laureen&rsquo;s panty episode had tightened up my bladder quite a bit. It was a sweet relief to feel the liquid bursting out of me. Then I went out to find the girls delving into the costumes.</p>
<p>This time they hardly took any notice of me as they undressed. They were getting used to me, and my casual remarks that &lsquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rsquo; had made them feel safe with me. Laureen, standing there wearing only her recently recovered pink panties, looked at me, smiled rather precociously and tossed her head back, though she did have one arm placed a little protectively across her chest, her hand resting on her other shoulder.</p>
<p>Then she bent down to pick up one of the costumes, and I caught a glimpse of a pretty little pointed breast, sticking up perhaps only two or three centimeters from her chest. As if she read my thoughts, she turned her head suddenly to glance at me, but I was quick enough to shift my eyes elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roy, come and dress up with us,&rdquo; Tina encouraged me quietly, slipping off a vest with a couple of small holes in it. Her parents didn&rsquo;t look after her terribly well, I thought.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t had much to do with Shelley&rsquo;s costume box, but I did know that it contained mainly girls&rsquo; clothes. So I answered, &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any boys&rsquo; costumes there, and you won&rsquo;t get me wearing one of those dresses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shelley, aren&rsquo;t there any boys&rsquo; costumes for Roy?&rdquo; asked Angela, as if to bring my attention to her as she stood there wearing only her soft white panties. She seemed to have forgotten about the accident to her wrist.</p>
<p>Shelley was busy with Lynn, who had just slipped out of her mini-skirt, and I could see Shelley was eager to wear it. She turned round and said, &ldquo;There are a few. I think there&rsquo;s a pirate costume and a kilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the kilt?&rdquo; asked Rebecca, holding up a piece of tartan clothing. Most of the costumes were kept in clear plastic bags so they would be kept clean but could still be identified.</p>
<p>Shelley nodded and grunted as she slipped on Lynn&rsquo;s mini-skirt. She didn&rsquo;t look too satisfied, though, as it was in fact about the length of her own dress. She was hoping for something really short. Lynn, for her part, had found a dress that Shelley used to wear about three years earlier, and was squeezing into it. A pale green color, it suited her well, except that it was even shorter than her own dress and her panties hung out of the bottom of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That kilt looks like a dress - are you going to wear it?&rdquo; Laureen asked me, deliberately moving her hand just slightly so as to expose to me one of her little breasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind wearing kilts,&rdquo; I grinned. I stripped off down to my underpants - brief and plain white, as I prefer - and then put on the white shirt and fixed the kilt, complete with sporran, around by waist.</p>
<p>Laureen, putting on a long, elegant pink dress, watched me dressing, while a couple of other girls were less obvious about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see you dance a Highland fling,&rdquo; suggested Nicky, just jokingly I think, when I had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better make some Scottish music for me, then,&rdquo; I grinned.</p>
<p>Laureen immediately cupped her hands round her mouth and started trying to make noises like bagpipes, and the others joined in. It was about the worst display of bagpipes I had ever heard, but I knew what I had to do, and danced around like a true Scotsman, swirling my kilt around and even adding a somersault in the middle. They quickly grew tired of trying so badly to imitate the peculiar bagpipe noises, though. When they stopped, so did I, and I flung myself backwards on to the ground, then sat up with my arms round my knees and smiling at them while they clapped. I knew they could see my underpants under my kilt, but I was still showing them that &lsquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Angela came to me for inspection, wearing a beautiful bright yellow dress which flowed around her knees. The colour didn&rsquo;t really suit her, but I smiled at her and told her she looked beautiful, which set her blushing so attractively again.</p>
<p>Then Tina came up. She had put on a little ballet tutu over her panties, but the sides came up very high, exposing the panties right to the top so it looked rather silly. She seemed to think so, as she asked me, &ldquo;Do you think it would be better to take my panties off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would look better that way,&rdquo; I answered, whereupon she pulled down the shoulder straps and started removing the tutu.</p>
<p>Laureen, now wearing a nurse&rsquo;s uniform and unable to mind her own business, came over and said to her, &ldquo;Tina, let me show you how to take your panties off under your tutu.&rdquo; Her idea, it seemed, was to pull one leg of the panties right down until she could take her foot out of it, and then easily pull the panties through the crotch of the tutu and down the other leg. She seemed most concerned that I should not see a girl naked, although obviously she knew I had done so with Shelley at least many times.</p>
<p>But Tina wasn&rsquo;t having any of it. &ldquo;No, I might tear them,&rdquo; she protested, turning away from Laureen and towards me, and pulling the tutu down to her ankles before Laureen could reach her. Her panties came down at the back as she did so, exposing her little white bottom.</p>
<p>Laureen sniffed and turned away, unwilling to associate herself with this distasteful event.</p>
<p>I did my best to look unconcerned and uninterested as Tina removed her panties and stood naked before me, her little white body standing out in contrast to her thin brown arms and legs. Her tiny vagina on its little mound was hardly visible between her legs. I forced myself not to smile as I thought to myself, as I so often do, that little girls are the most beautiful creatures on earth. Tina took rather too long in straightening out her tutu, but then put her legs into it one by one and pulled it on. She looked at me rather timidly, perhaps a little afraid I might have some silly comment to make about her nudity, but I just smiled and said, &ldquo;That looks much better. Are you going to do a dance for us now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head shyly, and then turned to Rebecca to show her.</p>
<p>Inside my heart was singing and my underpants felt swollen, warm and moist. I had won myself another conquest, another girl who trusted me enough to show me everything. Seeing Laureen accidentally reveal herself without her panties was a forbidden excitement, which is quite different from Tina&rsquo;s open trust.</p>
<p>The girls were still trying on different costumes and Lynn&rsquo;s mini-skirt was doing the rounds, but if they wanted the excitement of a very short skirt most of them were disappointed, as they were not tall enough. They were also admiring her panties, but were not yet confident enough with me to try those on in my presence.</p>
<p>Laureen was the only girl taller than Lynn, and she eventually had her turn at the mini-skirt. Much of Laureen&rsquo;s height was in her long legs, though, and the skirt just covered her underwear when she stood normally. Then she raised her arms and twirled around, revealing large expanses of pink panties while her friends giggled. Raising her arms, she swung her legs up in a hand-stand against a tree, and the dress of course flopped right down, even exposing her little breasts as she balanced upside-down. It seemed she was slowly becoming more confident in front of me, although she didn&rsquo;t want to show it.</p>
<p>Lynn&rsquo;s bra also aroused a lot of admiration. Seeing their interest, she took it off and gave it to Nicky to try on. Most of the girls were at this age just developing little bulges or points, apart from Tina, who was still completely flat. Laureen&rsquo;s little breasts were perhaps the largest of them, but Nicky was also developing little points that added to her natural beauty, if anything. I enjoyed sitting there and watching her, wearing only those slightly over-sized pale blue panties, wrapping the bra around those cute little pointed breasts of hers while the other girls watched keenly and competed for their turn.</p>
<p>It is a strange thing about Lynn that, although she does not like wearing panties unless she has to, she is quite happy to wear a bra even when nobody would know if she didn&rsquo;t. On this day she had actually been wearing a loose top with narrow shoulders, revealing large areas of white bra whenever she moved her arms. Not that this would ever bother her. She has strong breasts for her age, no points or unusual shapes, but just sticking out with straight profiles, broken by the nipples, in front of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any more costumes to wear, Roy?&rdquo; asked Lynn, wearing only those revealing brief panties and smiling at me as I was still sitting on the ground watching them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a pirate costume and a Superman,&rdquo; said Shelley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superman! I think he&rsquo;s a Superman!&rdquo; exclaimed Rebecca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Roy, try the Superman,&rdquo; Angela urged me, handing me the bag with the costume inside.</p>
<p>As I took it out, I saw that it was much too small for me. It was in three parts, with a cape and the black bottom part just like a swimming costume. It was supposed to meet the top part around the middle, but it was going to be difficult putting them on.</p>
<p>Still, I would try. I took off the kilt and shirt, and put them back in their bag. Then I picked up the bottom part of the Superman costume and looked at it. It was going to be a tight fit. I slipped off my underpants to try.</p>
<p>Again Shelley&rsquo;s friends didn&rsquo;t quite know what to do. They had already been a little shocked by the naked photograph of me, but here I was undressing completely in front of them. Laureen couldn&rsquo;t keep quiet.</p>
<p>She gave a giggle and announced, &ldquo;We can see your carrot, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood up straight and faced her, so they could see me clearly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s called a penis, actually,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laureen, don&rsquo;t be so silly,&rdquo; Shelley snapped at her. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Why don&rsquo;t you take your panties off too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not going to see my pussy,&rdquo; boasted Laureen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too private for boys.&rdquo; Little did she know! But I suspected the fuss she was making was now largely an act.</p>
<p>I put my feet into the Superman bottom and tried to pull them up. They came up past my knees and then grew tight around the thighs. They were too small to go over my bottom. I pulled them up at the front and back as far as they would go, but then got stuck. The top of my penis was still sticking stupidly out of the top and I could not get it inside.</p>
<p>Just at that moment, I heard the telephone ring inside the house.</p>
<p>Shelley had gone into the playhouse for some reason, so I had to run and answer it. I heard giggling from Laureen, I think it was, as I disappeared inside rather painfully with the costume around my bottom.</p>
<p>It was Aunt Sue, just phoning to check that everything was all right. I stood by the phone, with the costume too tight for me to sit, and looked down at the top end of my trapped penis while she told me that her friend was in quite a bad way and she would not be back for some time. I should be ready for when the parents came to pick up the girls at five o&rsquo;clock. She asked how we were getting on, and I told them we were playing dressing-up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got them in the pool yet, then,&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;Poor little things, they were so nervous about nude bathing this morning!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be even worse with you there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had now followed me in, with Rebecca holding Lynn&rsquo;s bra around her tiny breasts, so I handed the phone over to Shelley and went outside again. Some of the girls followed me. &ldquo;This is so tight it&rsquo;s squashing my penis,&rdquo; I explained with a laugh as I pulled off the costume. The tightness, continuing while I answered the phone, had made my penis swell and it was now standing almost straight out.</p>
<p>The girls looked at it in alarm, aware that it had changed its size and shape, so I quickly put on my underpants again. Then I fetched a deck chair from the playhouse and sat down in it, as Shelley came out of the house again. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough of costumes for me; there&rsquo;s nothing my size,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just watch the rest of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a fashion parade wearing our costumes,&rdquo; suggested Tina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Roy can be the audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he can judge us,&rdquo; put in Rebecca. &ldquo;Lynn, you must take part with us as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call it the Miss Beautiful Costume competition,&rdquo; Nicky decided for them all.</p>
<p>The girls thought this was a fine idea, so they looked around for their favorite costumes and change into them. Angela stopped a moment to whisper into my ear, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re very brave.&rdquo; I was glad that my inelegant problem with the costume had not made me a laughing stock. It showed at least they respected me, except perhaps for Laureen.</p>
<p>They had just started when Shelley suddenly announced, &ldquo;I need a wee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, she whipped off her panties, stood up close to a nearby tree with her legs apart and let loose a stream of urine towards the tree.</p>
<p>She always prefers to relieve herself this way. When she was only about three or four she watched me urinating and was fascinated by the way I stood up to do it into the bowl, or against a tree if we were outside.</p>
<p>I let her finger my penis, which she did very thoughtfully and said, &ldquo;I wish girls had one of those.&rdquo; But she seemed to decide from then on that if she couldn&rsquo;t have a penis of her own, at least she could urinate standing up like a boy. As she grew taller, though, she found she could not urinate accurately enough into the bowl, and so whenever possible she would do it outside where there was space and she did not have to aim carefully.</p>
<p>I remember that in her first year at school she got herself into a lot of trouble when she was caught urinating in the corner of the school playground - standing up, holding her panties in one hand and lifting her skirt high as she did so. At first I think they thought she was deliberately exposing herself, but fortunately her class teacher knew that she came from a nudist family and persuaded the headmaster to make allowances for her. But during the next couple of years I had to stop her several times from doing that in public, until she reluctantly learned for herself.</p>
<p>Most of the other girls stopped dressing and watched her, with perhaps some amusement. They clearly knew that this was the way she often did it, and she had probably done it that way this morning while they were there. Laureen for one turned to look at me to see what interest I was taking in the display, but I didn&rsquo;t show any. I still do find it interesting for Shelley to do this, but I have seen it many times. Once when Shelley was about five, when she was sitting on my lap, she lifted her arms to push back her hair and I tickled her under the armpits. She screamed with laughter and urinated all over my legs. Ever since then, I have told her I prefer her to use the tree, and it has become a family joke that she enjoys as much as anybody. I don&rsquo;t know whether the trees are too happy about it, though.</p>
<p>With girls being the creatures they are, it took perhaps half an hour or more for them to find the clothes they wanted and to change into them. Some of them tried several before they finally made their choice, with Nicky being particularly unable to make up her mind. While I was waiting I marked out a stage in front of the verandah for them to walk up and down.</p>
<p>Eventually they were ready. I was to judge who was Miss Beautiful Costume, and it wasn&rsquo;t going to be easy. They seemed strangely shy of going on stage first. Then Shelley said, &ldquo;Lynn&rsquo;s the oldest, so she must go first. We&rsquo;ll go in age order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynn didn&rsquo;t mind, so she stood by the side of the stage and the others worked out their positions in age order, which they knew pretty well, behind her. Shelley was at the back, as her birthday is right at the end of the school year. The judge sat there in his underpants waiting for a bunch of (in most cases) elegantly dressed girls. When they were ready, I called out, &ldquo;Number one!&rdquo; and Lynn marched on to the stage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t say she was very good. First of all she had chosen that old dress of Shelley&rsquo;s which was too tight for her and revealed her panties at the bottom. She had never had any interest in fashion parades, as was clear when she did her best to walk up and down, turn round and pose. After a few tries she walked off the side of the stage to a round of applause, came straight over to me and threw herself on to my lap, laughing. As she sat on my bare leg I could feel the sensual touch of her panties rubbing against it. I stroked them gently with my hand.</p>
<p>Rebecca appeared to be next in age order, and she obviously knew much more about modeling than Lynn did. She had found a brilliant Spanish dress with a full skirt, and she made a real meal of it, turning, posing, bending and stretching, with a lovely smile. There was a petticoat underneath which hung down a little, though, which spoilt the effect slightly. After mutters of &ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; from those in the line, she finished her act and came over to join us. She stood just next to me, smiling and leaning her arm on my shoulder.</p>
<p>The next in line was Nicky, who had eventually chosen an Indian sari.</p>
<p>It was a little tight, but it looked good. She also took quite a long time before joining us as well. She stood on the other side of me and put her arm on my other shoulder.</p>
<p>Then came Laureen. She had decided to be a Hawaiian girl. She wore a grass skirt, through which her panties showed whenever she moved, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to mind my seeing them now. On top she wore Lynn&rsquo;s bra, which was too loose for her. When she came down, she sat cross-legged on the ground to one side of the rest of us.</p>
<p>Next was Angela, wearing a beautiful old-fashioned bright sky-blue dress, almost the same color as the clothes she had arrived in. It was a little too tight for her, but it had a lace bodice at the top and the skirt came down in folds and layers, each with a lining of white frills. She looked delightful as she twirled most gracefully and the skirt swung gaily around her knees.</p>
<p>As Angela came down to join us, Lynn stood up and squeezed out of the little dress she was wearing. Clad only in my underpants, I had forgotten how hot it was, especially for those with tight clothes. Lynn sat down again, with those exciting panties pressed against the top of my thigh. Looking down, I could make out a darker mass through the crotch material that I knew was her mat of pubic hair. I smiled at her, and my penis fought against my underpants.</p>
<p>Tina was next. She was wearing the bikini, having changed into it quietly in front of me. Performing in public is not what she likes doing best, and she was quickly off the stage again.</p>
<p>Finally came Shelley, now ready and eager to show off. She was wearing a Scottish costume which I think was supposed to go with the kilt. The little pleated skirt, too small for her, bounced up and down as she twirled, flashing those rich white panties all the time. I felt such a warmth in my stomach and loins as I watched her and felt Lynn. Shelley danced, throwing up her arms, kicking out her legs and spinning like a top. It seemed as if she would never stop, until the others started shouting at her, and she came off the stage panting for breath and smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we go over to our judges, who will tell us who Miss Beautiful Costume is this year,&rdquo; announced Laureen in a grand voice. All the girls looked towards me, smiling.</p>
<p>I had been doing a lot of thinking, and found it very difficult. But in the end I had to make my choice. I stood up, hoping the shape of my underpants at the front did not look too obvious. Standing in front of the stage, I announced, &ldquo;And our number three prize winner today is . .</p>
<p>&quot; I paused for effect. &ldquo;Shelley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shelley gave a squeal, jumped rather inelegantly over to the stage and spun round twice, her skirt swinging up and revealing her panties again. &ldquo;Shelley, it&rsquo;s meant to be Miss Beautiful Costume, not Miss Beautiful Panties!&rdquo; laughed Laureen.</p>
<p>I went on, &ldquo;Our number two prize winner is . . . Nicky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a beaming smile Nicky came forward and stood in front of me in her sari while the others applauded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And our grand winner!&rdquo; I called out. &ldquo;Miss . . . Beautiful . . .</p>
<p>Costume . . . for this year . . . Angela!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angela, in that lovely blue dress, broke into a beautiful big smile and her cheeks went pink again. She stepped gracefully forward and I pretended to present her with a prize. She blushed again as I lifted her off the ground and kissed her on the cheek, and then unexpectedly she returned the kiss, quick and wet, as I put her down.</p>
<p>The losers did not seem too disappointed, as I suppose they knew they were not quite as good as the winners. Laureen did ask me, though, pretending to look very sad, &ldquo;What was wrong with my Hawaii costume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pointed to the problem. &ldquo;Your bra is not big enough for you,&rdquo; I grinned. Laureen and the others giggled, as they knew it was the other way round. Laureen, still pretending to be cross, pulled off the bra and threw it at Lynn, then broke into a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we take the costumes off now?&rdquo; asked Nicky, who was looking very sweaty. &ldquo;We should have had a cooler competition in this weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we should have a Miss Beautiful Panties competition, like Laureen said,&rdquo; laughed Rebecca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh, that&rsquo;s a good idea - let&rsquo;s do that!&rdquo; exclaimed Shelley, jumping up and down and deliberately flicking the front of her skirt up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; Nicky looked rather doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s! Come on, girls!&rdquo; squealed Shelley, throwing off her costume. &ldquo;Lynn&rsquo;s ready for it already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls now began to look as if they were doing something a little naughty, as they took their costumes off and started examining their own panties to see if they had a chance of winning. Probably it would not have bothered them were they by themselves, but they were not quite used to me yet.</p>
<p>Angela stood next to me, looked at me shyly and said, &ldquo;Please help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised, so I replied, &ldquo;Help you how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my costume off,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;My wrist is sore again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wondered if it really was sore, as she had not seemed to have a problem putting it on, but I was only too eager to help. There was a row of tiny buttons down the front, which fitted quite tightly on her.</p>
<p>I undid them carefully, feeling her chest and stomach pressing against my fingers as I dug them under the buttons. I spun her round to undo the sash at the back, and then gently slipped it down off her shoulders. She snuggled closer to me, pressing her bare chest against my arm. As I pried the bodice off her, I brushed the back of my fingers against one of her little nipples and could feel the soft tiny point. I moved my hands gently down her warm body, over her soft flat tummy, pulling the dress down slowly.</p>
<p>Then I pulled it down to her ankles, revealing her soft white panties.</p>
<p>Angela stepped out of it and smiled at me. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she whispered, blushing again. I thought she was going to kiss me, but she changed her mind. I put my arm round her naked waist, landing my hand on the side of her panties and gave her a gentle rub. The panties, as soft as they looked, moved under my hand and she smiled at me again, cheeks still glowing.</p>
<p>The other girls were by now lined up for the Miss Beautiful Panties competition. My heart warmed as I watched them, with their little bodies just beginning to show signs of womanhood. Laureen was standing there idly putting her thumb under the elastic waistband of her panties and flicking it out so it snapped back. Tina was standing with her hands down the back of her panties so I could see the sweet round curve of her bottom, perhaps because she had no pockets to put them in.</p>
<p>Shelley was dancing around gaily, calling out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m first this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Angela joined them they formed a line, waiting to go. Somehow they seemed more excited about Beautiful Panties than they had about Beautiful Costumes. Perhaps most of them were enjoying a new freedom for the first time - and there was also the forbidden feeling of naughtiness, perhaps.</p>
<p>Shelley came first, strutting up and down, sticking her chest out and head back, one hand saucily on her hips and the other waving gaily in the air, turning, bending and then dancing. The rich whiteness of my favorite type of panties shone in contrast to her brown sun-tanned skin; I would have no problems in judging this competition. She really enjoyed herself again, and once more the others had to shout at her to persuade her to leave the stage. She leapt off the stage and on to my lap. I wrapped my arms round her and enjoyed the warm feel of those delicious panties.</p>
<p>Then came Rebecca, with her white, slightly baggy panties with their little teddy bears. Again she put up a very elegant display, before coming off the stage and giving Shelley a nudge. &ldquo;We take it in turns on this seat,&rdquo; she told her. Shelley obediently slid off my lap and Rebecca, smiling confidently into my eyes, sat down with her legs over the side of the chair. I put my arms loosely around her, but carefully placed so I had a hand on her panties. They were cool, soft and thin to the touch.</p>
<p>Laureen was on already, strutting around in her pink, which somehow suited her character. I guessed by now that all her smart talk in the past and her insistence that I would not see her naked had been an act, as she put on a very sensual display, curving her body smoothly and writhing as if she were in pain. At one stage she turned round and stuck out her bottom towards me, enabling me to see the crack up the middle very clearly through the thin pink material. She kept thumbing the elastic in the waist of her panties, pulling it out and letting it back again. Then she twirled around, put her thumbs in the sides of her panties and pulled one side down and back up again and then the other as she did a jig. I could see as she did it the smooth valley of her groin each side, but no further; she took good care not to show too much. She finished her show with a bow and a curtsey, curtseying not with a skirt for obvious reasons, but with her panties, pulling them out to the sides as far as they would go, and then letting the elastic snap back again.</p>
<p>I wondered what she would do when she came off the stage. She had been aloof before, but now she came over and motioned to Rebecca, who obediently slid off my lap. Then Laureen jumped on, giving me her biggest smile, and I could see real warmth shining out of her eyes. I was winning with her! I put my arms round her again, and felt the soft fragility of those pink panties with my hand. Laureen put a hand down to help her find the position I wanted, right on top of my penis, and I&rsquo;m sure not by accident. Then she settled back against me, and I gritted my teeth with pain. She was sitting right on top of my penis, which had become most excited by these developments and was gasping for more space for itself.</p>
<p>I survived with difficulty, and had mixed feelings when the next act was short. Tina came on, very self-consciously again, and her panties were not very attractive, an almost grayish color and obviously rather worn. Her body was quite flat and her ribs showed through her chest clearly. Laureen did not look very pleased at having to leave her seat so soon. It looked as if all the girls had agreed privately that my lap was the seat for the most recent contestant. Tina smiled so sweetly into my eyes as she took her seat, and I smiled back and wrapped my arms warmly around her, forgetting at first where I always want my hand. Then I shifted my position, partly to give my penis some more room, and put my hand on the side of her panties. They felt a little rough, but there was a smooth skin underneath that I could also feel.</p>
<p>Nicky came on next, looking perhaps a little embarrassed that her pale blue panties were rather loose. She did not do much stretching but simply walked up and down, turning round a few times, and then came to take her place on my lap. I held her gently, noticing that her panties were actually patterned in squares separated by little ridges rather than colors. As I moved my hand, the loose material shifted under it.</p>
<p>I pushed gently, and found a loop opening up at the back. By looking down behind her back as she faced the stage, I could see right down to her soft white bottom.</p>
<p>Angela was already performing and I had to keep my eyes on her. Her white panties shone when she moved into the sunlight through the tree branches, and her face shone in a half-smile. She finished quickly, eager I suspected to claim a seat on my lap, but, just like her, she walked over very slowly, pretending not to care. She sat down with a pink-faced smile and leaned back against me. When nobody else was looking, she put her head back, gave me a light loving kiss on the cheek and turned away again, blushing. I gave her a squeeze and a rub with my hand, covering her panties on her left groin. I could feel the groove down there, soft and inviting.</p>
<p>Lynn was at the end of the line this time. Although I have seen her naked many times, I find her panties more sexually arousing than her nudity. As she walked and turned, I found my eyes fixed on those half- transparent frills around the crotch, clear enough to show something darker the far side. My body began to respond, and I shifted uncomfortably under Angela.</p>
<p>Lynn finished and came to take her seat, although she would not be able to stay there long. She smiled confidently at me, but I whispered to her, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t possibly let you win, you know!&rdquo; She grunted, smiling, and I knew she understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, judge, who won?&rdquo; called out Rebecca. I walked out slowly to the stage, trying to think. This time I had been so excited with the experience that I had forgotten that, but at least I only had second and third place to think of.</p>
<p>I waited, smiling, for silence as I thought. Then I announced, &ldquo;Our number three prize winner is . . . Rebecca!&rdquo; I actually wanted to name Angela among the winners, but thought I had better not, as she had won last time. Smiling, Rebecca came to the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And number two . . . Laureen!&rdquo; I called out. With her wide confident grin Laureen marched up to the stage and curtseyed to the audience again, pulling her panties wide at the side but remembering to pull the material back so that I couldn&rsquo;t see down the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And finally, our Miss Beautiful Panties winner is . . .&rdquo; I began. At that moment Shelley started strutting proudly out to the front, with a mischievous smirk on her face. Teasing her, I said, &ldquo;Our Miss Beautiful Panties winner is Lynn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shelley stopped and stared at me, her mouth dropping open in surprise.</p>
<p>I burst out laughing and corrected myself, &ldquo;No, it really is you, Shelley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling again, Shelley came up to receive her imaginary prize and a kiss. Then she turned to the others and said, &ldquo;I knew all the time I would win because Roy says these are his favorite type of panties.&rdquo; I wondered how many of the others would now be begging their mothers to buy the same sort. Angela for one, I could tell just by looking at her.</p>
<p>From Miss Beautiful Costume to Miss Beautiful Panties . . . I wondered if the girls had any further beauty contests in mind. They did indeed.</p>
<h5 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#chapter-4">#</a></h5>
<p>Shelley was not long in coming up with her next idea. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have one more competition,&rdquo; she said, her eyes sparkling. &ldquo;This one will be a Miss Beautiful Skin competition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girls looked uncomfortable. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Tina, although I&rsquo;m sure she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do it in our skins!&rdquo; explained Shelley, whipping off her panties and capering about. &ldquo;Like this, naked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a Miss Beautiful Boobs and Pussy competition,&rdquo; said Laureen with a wicked grin. &ldquo;You can do it if you like, but I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laureen, it&rsquo;s very good fun when you try it,&rdquo; Lynn encouraged her.</p>
<p>Some of the other girls looked uncomfortable, though, and there were one or two glances in my direction. I thought I had better show no interest and go away for a short while in the hope that might help them to decide in favor. So I stood up and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirsty. I&rsquo;ll go and get us some more lemonade.&rdquo; Then I went into the house.</p>
<p>I came out three or four minutes later carrying a tray of drinks, hoping that they might all by now be dressed (or rather undressed) for Miss Beautiful Skin. But they were still standing around in their panties. Shelley was stepping into hers again and saying, &ldquo;Well, I think you&rsquo;re just spoilsports. It doesn&rsquo;t matter with Roy!&rdquo; Lynn stayed quite naked, though.</p>
<p>As I held out the tray I said, &ldquo;Shelley, if they&rsquo;re not happy about it, it&rsquo;s best not to do it. I don&rsquo;t want anybody feeling bad. Let&rsquo;s just keep to things that everybody agrees on.&rdquo; I hoped this might have the opposite effect of encouraging them to take part after all, but they still didn&rsquo;t look happy.</p>
<p>Shelley tried to argue while taking her plastic cup, but instead knocked it over, spilling the lemonade all down my front and soaking my underpants. &ldquo;Ooh, sorry,&rdquo; she exclaimed guiltily, as the others jumped back to keep dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll just have to be Mr. Beautiful Skin until these dry,&rdquo; I laughed, putting the tray down and slipping out of my underpants. I rinsed them under the tap and left them in the sun to dry.</p>
<p>The girls had their drinks, obviously thinking about what to do next.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they wanted very much to swim in the roasting hot weather, but did not want to go in without their costumes. Probably someone would suggest swimming in their panties in a moment, and I would feel I ought to agree, though I was hoping for something a little less over-dressed.</p>
<p>Then Rebecca, full of energy, shouted out, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play Catch!&rdquo; She touched Shelley on the arm and scampered away. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re it!&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>The others joined in immediately, running away squealing as Shelley chased them. Then she came back and touched me as I stood still watching them. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re it!&rdquo; she shouted.</p>
<p>I was ready for that, and as she turned to run away I shot out a hand and touched her on the shoulder. She turned and touched me again, but I was again too quick for her, touching her back before she got away.</p>
<p>After this had happened three or four times, she shouted out, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair! You can&rsquo;t do that when you&rsquo;ve just been caught!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girls seemed to agree, so I developed another plan to save my energy. As Shelley chased me, I ran behind Angela as she fled. I held out my hand for Shelley to touch behind me, and immediately passed on the touch to Angela, who was in front of me and under the new rules could not touch me in return. Angela caught Tina, who also started chasing me. This time I followed Shelley in the same way, and touched her as soon as Tina touched me. It must have looked a strange sight if anybody had been able to see us, a naked teenage boy running all over the place with little girls in panties.</p>
<p>All the girls to be caught seemed to want to catch me for a while until they found that I could be caught quite easily, but was always able to pass it on to another girl immediately. Then they lost interest and chased each other and Lynn, deciding I was no fun any more and leaving me.</p>
<p>Nicky was having a bit of a problem, though. Her panties were a couple of sizes too large for her, and when she ran they started slipping down. Several times I saw her hastily pulling them up over her cute white bottom, and when it was her turn to chase she had to run with one hand on her waist to hold them up. The other girls thought this was quite funny.</p>
<p>Then the game took a new turn. Laureen was chasing, and she was after Nicky. Nicky found it difficult to run with one hand on her panties, and when Laureen caught her, she didn&rsquo;t just touch her but grabbed her round the waist, pulling her panties down with her arms so that Nicky&rsquo;s bare white bottom shone in the sunlight.</p>
<p>Nicky squealed and broke away, pulling them up again hastily. Laureen stood there laughing excitedly, but as she did so Shelley ran up behind her and mischievously pulled her panties down at the back too. Now it was Laureen&rsquo;s turn to scream, as she pulled them up again quickly, shot a glance in my direction and then chased after Shelley. She quickly caught her and pulled down her panties too, only for Tina, of all people, to pull hers down at the back again.</p>
<p>Immediately this was a new game. All the girls were chasing each other, trying to pull their panties down. Most of the pulls were from behind and just far enough to uncover the bottom. Then, as Angela tried to catch Laureen, Laureen put her arms out to grapple with her, only for Nicky to pull her panties down from behind so sharply that they sank to her knees and I caught a glimpse of her beautiful pink vagina again.</p>
<p>This time she knew it. She tried in vain to free her arms from Angela to pull them up again, but could not, so she fell forwards to the ground to cover herself, pulling Angela down with her.</p>
<p>I was prepared to stop the fun immediately if any of them did not like it, but they were all screaming and laughing wickedly as they circled each other, trying to find an opening. Nicky was the easiest victim as her panties were so loose that they came down easily. She fell backwards to the ground, knees up and apart, as Rebecca tried to pull her panties down from behind, only for Shelley to nip in, grab Nicky&rsquo;s panties round the crotch and pull them down almost to her knees. As she kicked, I caught a glimpse of a little slit reaching up between her legs. I watched with Lynn, a broad smile on my face, and counted to myself. Five girls apart from Lynn and Shelley, and I now had three out of five: Laureen, Tina and now Nicky. I felt rather like a heel for counting vaginas, but I was scoring only with my eyes and developing a real tenderness for their owners. It has that effect on me. I will never be a sexual molester because I feel so loving and protective towards the girls I get to see naked.</p>
<p>Angela ran up to me to hide behind me, although no one was chasing her.</p>
<p>I bent down and took hold of her panties around the waist, pretending I would pull them down. She squealed and caught hold of me round the waist, but didn&rsquo;t try to stop me. But I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to do it.</p>
<p>Not that I meant to - I expected her to squeal and struggle, but she acted as if she would have let me.</p>
<p>Then again the game took a different turn. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get Nicky!&rdquo; shouted Laureen, and all the girls seized hold of the unfortunate Nicky. I hurried over, ready to call a halt if necessary. But although Nicky was kicking and shouting, she was also laughing so hard that I saw no need to stop them. They had her on the ground, still kicking, and Laureen pulled her panties right down to her ankles, giving me another glorious view of this beautiful little girl&rsquo;s most secret place - soft, pink and adorable.</p>
<p>Perhaps Laureen thought that by selecting others to strip, she was taking attention away from herself. It was Shelley&rsquo;s turn next, or so Laureen intended. &ldquo;Quick, get Shelley!&rdquo; Laureen shouted, making a grab for my cousin.</p>
<p>But Shelley broke away, and she had the answer to the situation.</p>
<p>Whipping off her panties, she waved them above her head and shouted, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get me now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Laureen came to a frustrated halt, Rebecca pulled at her panties from behind. Laureen turned on her, but Rebecca took her cue from Shelley, pulling off her own panties and dancing away. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get me either!&rdquo; she gloated. Another beautiful sight for my eyes, and I just hoped that nobody was going to look in the direction of my penis for the time being. Four out of five I had seen now.</p>
<p>The fifth and last came immediately. Angela did not want to wait for Laureen to turn her attention to her. &ldquo;Please take off my panties for me before they get me,&rdquo; she asked, holding up her sore wrist to explain why she could not do it herself.</p>
<p>There was nothing I wanted to do more. Kneeling down, I turned her to face me. Then I placed my hands on the elastic top of her soft white panties and pulled down slowly and gently, savoring every moment. Down past the valleys of her groin which led down like a V I went, and then I could see the skin turn inwards at the very top of her vagina. I reached round the back to pull the panties down over her bottom, and then pulled down at the front to expose that delightful little vagina completely. I was in an excellent position to see even the almost invisible fair hairs lining it, still very short but one day to grow.</p>
<p>She had no visible mound to speak of, but the skin just curved smoothly downwards to disappear between her legs. I felt my penis jerk between my own legs as I pulled the panties down to her ankles. She put her hands on my shoulders and stepped out of them, as naked as the day she was born. I put my arm gently around her bare waist as she whispered her thanks and then turned to look at the others, arms round my neck.</p>
<p>Tina had long since removed her panties, and now the only one whose private place still lay hidden was Laureen. The others advanced on her, all still giggling at the naughtiness of it all. Laureen made a break for it, heading straight for me. I was still crouched down next to Angela as Laureen ran straight into my arms, shouting, &ldquo;Save me, Roy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others all gathered round, red-faced, panting for breath, stark naked and not ashamed of it for the present. They were not quite ready to seize Laureen as she clung on to me. &ldquo;Pull her panties down, Roy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shelley shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do that sort of thing to girls unless I am invited,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>Laureen was not about to invite me. She reached down, threw off her panties herself, tossed them in the air and ran. &ldquo;Come for a swim!&rdquo; she called back over her shoulder, and she leapt straight into the pool, naked.</p>
<p>It was most certainly time for swimming now. All of us, including Angela with her supposedly sore wrist, ran over to the pool and dived in. It is a shallow pool, with the water nowhere much more than a meter deep. It is also quite small, so the eight of us had very little room to ourselves. But the cold water did restore my penis to its usual size and shape.</p>
<p>I dived in, and when I came up for air the person next to me was Laureen. She squealed and jumped at me, wrapping her arms round my neck and trying unsuccessfully to push me under the water. I could feel her little pointed breasts pushing softly against my chest. &ldquo;This is fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>she exclaimed. I wrapped an arm round her as she tried to slither away and pulled her back to me. Most conveniently, my hand was placed over her left nipple, firm but yielding and with a little lump somewhere down underneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it who wasn&rsquo;t going to let me see her naked?&rdquo; I teased her gently, nibbling at her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really mind,&rdquo; she told me, and then to prove what she said she pushed herself out of the water to sit on the side of the pool, opening her legs so I could enjoy another view of her vagina. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d never let any other boy see my pussy. Or my boobs, even. Only you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt honored. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why not,&rdquo; I smiled at her. &ldquo;You have such a beautiful body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she went shy again, blushing, putting a hand down to cover her groin and slipping away into the water. But I could tell she was pleased.</p>
<p>One of the best things about swimming with girls is that under cover of the water they will allow me to do things to them that they would feel shy about above it. These girls came to wrestle with me and seemed to ignore the fact that my hands often came in contact with their wet little breasts and sometimes their vaginas. They would kiss me wetly, and often their legs brushed my penis.</p>
<p>I was just putting Rebecca over my shoulder, enjoying the cold feel of her tight little bottom, when I heard a voice calling, &ldquo;Catch me, Roy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a little slide at the far end of the pool and Shelley was sitting at the top, with her legs spread apart, ready to slide into me.</p>
<p>I tipped Rebecca over my shoulder and held out my hands to catch her.</p>
<p>She whizzed right into me, landing on top of me with her legs around my chest.</p>
<p>Laureen was already on her way to the slide, scrambling out of the pool on her elbows with her backside in the air and her vagina showing beneath it like a zip fastener. Others followed. Gaily they would scramble to the top of the slide, then sit down with their knees up and apart in front of me before sliding down into my arms. Lynn joined in as well, and came through the first time so fast that I actually got a mouthful of her pubic hair as her legs landed exactly on the top of my shoulders.</p>
<p>Laureen now seemed to be taking a pride in giving me a magnificent view of her pussy, as she calls it, spreading her legs wide and sliding down on her back with her legs high in the air, shrieking with laughter. Her bottom hit me in the chest, and as I staggered backwards she flopped over on to her back, leaving her open vagina on her pubic mound sticking up inches in front of my nose. It took all my willpower not to kiss it. Not yet.</p>
<p>Finally our energy began to run out. One by one the girls crawled out of the pool to lie in the shade, most of them flat on their backs pointing their hairless little vaginas to the sky. I was able to see that Laureen had some long hairs developing between her legs, but none of those little vaginas had yet been touched by the sort of thick hair Lynn had.</p>
<p>Tina, the barest of them all, crept close to Lynn and whispered to her, while pointing towards her pubic hair, &ldquo;Will I look like that when I&rsquo;m big?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynn smiled and said in her Danish accent, &ldquo;I am not very big, but maybe you will look like it.&rdquo; Not that Tina ever looked likely to grow big, either. Lynn went on to explain how girls often look different as they grow older, some having more hair or a different color or shape of hair in their pubic area than others.</p>
<p>The young ones to me all look almost the same, when standing, at least.</p>
<p>Some vaginas are smaller or shorter than others - Tina&rsquo;s was very small, while Rebecca&rsquo;s was perhaps the longest, followed by Laureen.</p>
<p>Some open more easily than others when spread - it was easy to see right inside with Shelley and Laureen, while I glimpsed the shiny white of the membrane as Angela, knees up and legs apart, brushed some grass cuttings firmly aside from her vagina. Nicky, though, can sit cross- legged with the lips of her vagina still staying firmly together. Some have more of a mound than others. Tina and Angela were very flat, while Rebecca&rsquo;s stood out clearly, the bulging lips turning inward to make a very exciting deep black valley.</p>
<p>But in ordinary positions there is very little difference, and when you have seen one, you have seen them all. I wouldn&rsquo;t care a great deal if it was not for the occasional thrill, as with Laureen at lunchtime, of seeing something forbidden, or the trust shown by Tina, for example, the first of the five friends to give me the gift of a free view.</p>
<p>Things like this give me real warmth that makes it all worth seeing.</p>
<p>If I do not found a girl attractive, I really don&rsquo;t want to see any more. But these were all very attractive little girls, although younger than I, and their trusting nakedness brought a warmth and excitement to my loins.</p>
<p>Shelley was the last out of the pool. &ldquo;I need the toilet again,&rdquo; she announced, fingering her vagina for a moment. &ldquo;I drank a lot and I almost did a wee in the pool.&rdquo; She went over to the nearby tree, opened her legs wide and sprayed it with a stream of urine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what it&rsquo;s like pissing that way,&rdquo; said Laureen, giggling and scrambling to her feet. She went over to Shelley, stood next to her and let loose. While Shelley thrust her vagina forward, though, Laureen was looking down at what she was doing, and the urine splashed straight downwards between her feet.</p>
<p>My penis now started jerking wildly, and I rolled over to try to hide it. The other girls all wanted to try it. Nicky, giggling, thrust her pretty little hips back and tried to reach the tree from two yards away, but landed well short. She put her fingers under her vagina to give it a push, and managed to reach a bit further.</p>
<p>Tina did not open her legs wide enough, and the urine dribbled all down her leg, causing her to squeal and look for some leaves to wipe herself. Rebecca managed in the same way as Shelley, pelvis forward and urinating steadily in a thick stream. Angela, like Laureen, was content to drop it straight down to the ground.</p>
<p>I could hardly believe my eyes. This was about the most incredible sight I had ever seen. I often see girls naked, and some of them don&rsquo;t mind me watching them relieve themselves, but not many older than five and certainly never a group of ten-year-olds. Over near the hedge Lynn, more conventionally, was squatting to do hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how boys do it,&rdquo; Shelley informed them all when they had finished. &ldquo;I always do it that way when I can. But boys can do it further than I can. They can even do it upwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that true, Roy?&rdquo; Rebecca wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you show us?&rdquo; asked Laureen daringly.</p>
<p>After all I had said about &lsquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rsquo;, I could hardly refuse.</p>
<p>I stood up, aware that my penis was now pretty large and strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it looks bigger than others,&rdquo; commented Tina, looking at my penis, quite puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because they use it for sex, silly,&rdquo; Laureen told her bossily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gets big and hard so they can stick it in your wee,&rdquo; added Nicky.</p>
<p>Tina looked shocked and obviously had not heard about the facts of life. &ldquo;That must hurt!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does the first time, but after that it&rsquo;s not so bad,&rdquo; declared Laureen, as if she had all the experience.</p>
<p>Tina looked bewildered. &ldquo;But why do they put it in your wee?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how grown-ups make babies,&rdquo; Rebecca explained patiently. &ldquo;Stuff like wee goes through his wee into your body and sometimes a baby grows.&rdquo; Obviously the word &lsquo;wee&rsquo; in their vocabulary could at different times mean a penis, a vagina or urine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Roy and Lynn can show us how it works,&rdquo; suggested Laureen, with a slightly embarrassed smirk.</p>
<p>I drew the line at that. &ldquo;Oh, no, we&rsquo;re not ready to make babies yet,&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said firmly, sitting down and hoping they had forgotten about my first demonstration.</p>
<p>But they hadn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Roy, please show us how boys wee,&rdquo; begged Laureen, pulling her face into a very attractive pleading look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I agreed, turning to Shelley&rsquo;s tree. Holding my penis in my right hand, I tried to urinate, but I was a bit self-conscious and it took several seconds before I could start.</p>
<p>The girls stared fascinated as I moved my penis around to send the spray up the trunk of the tree almost to my chest level by pushing hard, and a further distance across the ground than any of them could manage. &ldquo;Gee, I can&rsquo;t do it up there,&rdquo; said Nicky in wonder. They were most interested to see how I could aim anywhere I wanted just by moving my penis, while they of course could do very little to control their stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In junior school I had a friend called Thomas,&rdquo; I told them. &ldquo;He could wee so hard that one day when we were in the toilets he wee&rsquo;d right out of the toilet window. So we all shouted, &lsquo;Hail to the rain-maker!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls giggled. &ldquo;Did he get into trouble?&rdquo; asked Tina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of the teachers found out,&rdquo; I replied as my supply ran out. I shook my penis dry, which also caused some interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do now?&rdquo; asked Angela once the show was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Beautiful Skin!&rdquo; shouted Shelley, jumping up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s!&rdquo; agreed Laureen, her eyes sparkling. What a change in less than an hour! Her expression still showed that she thought it was a very naughty thing to do, but now she was no longer worried about me it was very exciting as well. There was a chorus of agreement from the others, and they started off at a run towards the stage.</p>
<p>Lynn and I followed them, but I thought I had better say something before we started. I knew the parents, mostly diplomatic staff, were far more open-minded about nudity than the English school, but I didn&rsquo;t want any trouble. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; I said to the girls. &ldquo;Perhaps we shouldn&rsquo;t do this. Some parents when you tell them might think we were doing something rude, and you might get into big trouble and cause trouble for me as well. Maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t even have swum naked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t matter, we just won&rsquo;t tell them,&rdquo; replied Laureen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we, girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; they all chorused, so I took it as safe. I settled down in my deck chair to watch the show.</p>
<p>Shelley insisted on being first again as it was her idea. As she went on, dancing around as usual and displaying her lovely little body so freely, I thought how different she and Lynn looked from the others.</p>
<p>Those two had a lovely light tan all over their bodies from years of nakedness in the sun. Shelley was a little lighter where her school swimming costume fitted over her, as there were obviously times when she had to use a costume. But the difference was hardly noticeable.</p>
<p>As usual, Shelley had almost to be chased off the stage, after which she ran down to sit on my lap again. She put an arm round my neck, gave me a massive kiss and pressed her cheek against mine as Nicky tiptoed on to the stage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t let you win again, Shelley,&rdquo; I whispered to her, getting a gentle groan in reply.</p>
<p>Nicky is a keen swimmer, but she obviously used her costume for it all the time. Her golden-brown tan came to an abrupt end where her school costume began, and her chest, back, tummy, loins and bottom were all a pale white. She was so pretty, but I felt a bit afraid that so much sun might harm such a white skin. She gracefully pointed her toes, danced and leapt. Without looking like a flirt, she managed to look dangerously seductive without even trying, and the other girls all stared at her as well.</p>
<p>She came down to take Shelley&rsquo;s place on my lap, smiling at me with her wide hazel eyes and pulling her gently curling hair into place. Then, blushingly, she kissed my cheek. I returned it gently and she smiled back. What a beauty!</p>
<p>All Shelley&rsquo;s other friends had bodies which showed clearly the marks of swimming costumes worn regularly, and large private areas which had never seen the light of sun before. Rebecca, the next, had three different hues to her body, as she obviously wore quite tiny bikinis regularly and her stomach and back were partly tanned. Rebecca too gave me a warm smile and a kiss as she settled down on my lap, and this was clearly now the unspoken rule.</p>
<p>Laureen came and capered around seductively, but was perhaps a little too obvious in showing off her pretty little breasts, like new toys - which indeed they were. Despite the lack of flesh on her tummy, her bottom was perhaps a little too large. The other girls, I noticed, when they sat on my lap made sure they sat clear of my penis, still being a little uncomfortable with it, but Laureen again made sure she brushed it with her hand and then sat in such a way that it touched her bare thigh. Then she gave me a big sharp smacking kiss, giggled and turned to watch the stage.</p>
<p>Angela was another very sweet entry, not quite so pink-faced as usual, but still very clearly out to impress me. I was entranced by her lovely smooth body all the way down from her little nipples to the soft, tender folds of skin between her legs. When she had finished she settled down very gently on my lap and gave me the cutest little kiss that I was naturally delighted to return.</p>
<p>Then came Tina, and I was painfully aware that she was the only one not to have won a place yet in these competitions and afraid that it was hardly likely I could award her anything for this, as she always did everything so shyly. But all the same I gave her a big beaming smile as she stood at the front of the stage, waiting for my attention. Then slowly, gently, she walked, turned, jogged, stretched and danced a little. Suddenly she had found her confidence from somewhere and I was most impressed. Her little bony body was flat but somehow graceful, and I noticed that her bottom was so small and smooth that it hardly stuck out at all.</p>
<p>Lynn, at the end again, actually looked the least impressive of them all. She just doesn&rsquo;t seem body-conscious at all and didn&rsquo;t seem to know how to show it off to good effect. Still, I got my kiss before I stood up to announce the winners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Third prize goes to . . . Angela!&rdquo; Blushing fiercely now, Angela came up for her kiss and prize. She gave me a warm hug, accidentally pushing her side against my penis as she did so and quickly moving it away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second prize goes to . . . Tina!&rdquo; The girl herself, standing at the back, looked round with an open mouth in surprise, not expecting anything. Then she gave a big but shy smile and came forward. Ever so gently, I knelt down to give her a hug and a kiss, glad that I could honestly give her something for a good show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And our Miss Beautiful Skin for this year is . . . Nicky!&rdquo; I announced. There was warm applause, as for the others, but also some surprised murmuring. I couldn&rsquo;t quite understand why, as Nicky in particular had moved and displayed herself perfectly. Smiling, Nicky came up and rested her cheek against my shoulder before giving me a long, loving hug and kiss.</p>
<p>Then Laureen said, &ldquo;Well, they were good, but we thought Lynn and Shelley would beat all the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt surprised. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are the same color all over,&rdquo; explained Laureen. &ldquo;The rest of us are all patchy because we always swim in our costumes when we go anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t consciously thought of that when judging. The others had seemed so attractive to me simply because of their pretty little white bodies where the sun had never ventured before. But I didn&rsquo;t want to say so, in case it put them off nude swimming. So I thought quickly and then said, &ldquo;Well, you know, I didn&rsquo;t think it would be fair to count them in this competition. They have an unfair advantage, so I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t count that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They seemed to accept what I said, and then Rebecca said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirsty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please may we have some more lemonade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I agreed and was just about to go inside when I looked at my watch, the only item of clothing I had been wearing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost four o&rsquo;clock now, and your parents are due in half an hour,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We had better be getting our clothes on in case any of them come early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, don&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; Laureen instructed the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we have another swim first?&rdquo; asked Angela. I gave them five minutes and then went inside.</p>
<p>Inside the kitchen I was pouring the lemonade when Tina, still naked, came in through the door. She smiled shyly as I looked at her and said, &ldquo;Thank you for being so kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I crouched down and she walked into my arms, putting her head against my shoulder. I noticed that she smelt slightly of urine from where she had dribbled down her leg. I knelt with one knee up in front of me and one behind, and she straddled herself on the one in front, her tiny vagina pressing against the top of my thigh. We cuddled before she gave me a wet kiss and then ran out of the door for a swim, her flat little bottom wobbling as she did so.</p>
<p>I brought out the drinks and called the girls, who drank and then we all changed back into our clothes, feeling a big sense of anti-climax.</p>
<p>It had been great, and all Shelley&rsquo;s friends looked starry-eyed, as if they had just returned from the most wonderful show or display they had ever seen. &ldquo;I wish we didn&rsquo;t have to wear clothes,&rdquo; I heard Nicky say as she put on her slightly large light blue panties again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure my mum and dad will never let me be naked at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t we start our own nudist club?&rdquo; asked Shelley, her eyes sparkling. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t tell anybody what it is, except my mum, and she won&rsquo;t mind and she won&rsquo;t tell. Let&rsquo;s have our first meeting on Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roy, can you come?&rdquo; asked Laureen, and I was happy to see the note of pleading in her eyes. &ldquo;And Lynn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we can,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need somebody to be in charge while Shelley&rsquo;s mum is at work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll all wear mini-skirts to come in!&rdquo; Shelley continued excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I broke in. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not getting me in a mini- skirt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls laughed. &ldquo;You can wear the kilt!&rdquo; Rebecca suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or that Superman outfit!&rdquo; giggled Laureen.</p>
<p>Again I felt excitement warming my loins. I was sure Monday would be even better, if possible.</p>
<p>Part 5</p>
<p>On Monday morning Lynn and I set off for my Aunt Sue&rsquo;s house bright and early before my aunt left for work. We had a slight problem on the way as we cycled over to her house.</p>
<p>We had just cycled out of the gate when I turned round to say something to Lynn, who was cycling behind me, and suddenly noticed what I should have noticed before. Lynn was wearing her usual very short mini-skirt, a green one this time, and as her legs pumped up and down I suddenly noticed, instead of her usual sexy white panties, her thick mat of curly light brown pubic hair. I stopped straight away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Lynn, for goodness&rsquo; sake go and put some panties on,&rdquo; I urged her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want everyone we meet on the road seeing up your skirt like that. You might cause some accidents. We don&rsquo;t want anybody killing himself through watching you instead of the road.&rdquo; (&ldquo;What a way to go!&rdquo; I thought to myself.) &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t do that. I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; protested Lynn, shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do mind,&rdquo; I argued. It was not often we did argue. &ldquo;You must go and put some panties on. And bring a hat or a jersey to keep on your lap while we&rsquo;re cycling. It&rsquo;s not good in this country to show your panties in public either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want being seen with me, you go in front and I will come behind where nobody can see we are with each other - together,&rdquo; Lynn replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s silly,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d let me teach you the ways of this country when you came, so you must do as I say. Quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynn still argued, and I started to get angry, which upset her a bit.</p>
<p>In the end, she dropped the bicycle to the ground and went inside. She was out again in a minute, saying nothing, but lifting the front of her skirt to show me those white panties underneath, with the almost transparent frills at the crotch. I hoped nobody else was watching. She pushed her hat rather crossly down into the gap between her thighs and followed me as I cycled down the road.</p>
<p>This delayed us a bit, and Aunt Sue was waiting for us by the driveway.</p>
<p>We were still earlier to arrive than any of Shelley&rsquo;s friends, though.</p>
<p>Shelley was there, wearing a little dark blue mini-skirt that just covered her panties - assuming that she was wearing any. She gave us both an excited hug and kiss, and then told us, &ldquo;Rebecca and Tina can&rsquo;t come. Rebecca&rsquo;s going out and Tina&rsquo;s got diarrhea. She did it in her panties at breakfast and she&rsquo;s crying all the time because she wants to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was very sorry to hear that. I had liked them both, especially that little Tina, so timid yet so loveable and in need of protection.</p>
<p>Perhaps she had become too excited about this day. Shelley went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve invited two more girls to take their places, though - Brenda and Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell them it&rsquo;s a nudist club?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly, because their mums might have heard or they might have told them,&rdquo; explained Shelley. &ldquo;I said it was a mini-skirt club and they must come wearing their mini-skirts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s very fair,&rdquo; Aunt Sue told Shelley. &ldquo;You need to tell them beforehand what you are going to do. Many girls I&rsquo;m sure would be most unhappy just to visit a friend and then find out they have to take their clothes off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might be too shy to do that, especially with me here,&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<p>Shelley looked crestfallen. &ldquo;Well, they won&rsquo;t have to if they don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But before long I know they&rsquo;ll want to, like all the others did on Saturday. Here comes somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I think there must be no taking off of clothes unless everybody present agrees,&rdquo; said Aunt Sue firmly, as the first car came down the driveway. &ldquo;Roy, will you see to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will do,&rdquo; I agreed, rather annoyed with Shelley. Her thoughtlessness could spoil the day.</p>
<p>The car stopped beside them and Laureen got out. On Saturday she had been wearing a flowing skirt down to her knees, but today she was wearing about the flimsiest mini-dress I have ever seen - apart from Lynn&rsquo;s, of course. It was very broad, floating out around her body, barely covered her bottom and was made of black and orange floral material so thin that I could make out some very tiny panties underneath.</p>
<p>Her mother called to Aunt Sue through the car window. &ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;re all going to stay out of the public view, considering the dress Laureen is wearing today!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;She insisted that was the one she wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll keep her on the property,&rdquo; Aunt Sue assured her. This was clearly one of the more liberated mothers. Aunt Sue introduced Lynn and me to Laureen&rsquo;s mother, reminding her that we had done &lsquo;such a wonderful job of entertaining the girls on Saturday&rsquo;. I smiled and used my best manners, knowing how important it was that the parents thought I was a suitable person to help look after their daughters.</p>
<p>The others started to arrive. Next was Angela, who looked up at me shyly, blushing a little as usual. She was wearing all white, a white blouse and a short white pleated tennis skirt. Again Aunt Sue introduced Lynn and me, as she did with all the parents.</p>
<p>Then came the new girl Brenda, whom I hadn&rsquo;t met before. Brenda is small and petite, with straight fair hair coming down in a ponytail behind her. She is very thin, though, rather like Tina, and I could very easily have clasped one hand round her upper arms if I had wanted.</p>
<p>She was wearing a light violet top and a short skirt in dark purple.</p>
<p>She looked rather quiet and shy of me. I wondered how she would feel when she found out she had joined a nudist club.</p>
<p>Nicky came next, looking as beautiful as ever, if a little too grown up, in a white top and short tight black skirt. As soon as her mother had driven out, she raised the front of the skirt to reveal bright white panties and said, &ldquo;I was going to wear red panties today but I thought the colors wouldn&rsquo;t match.&rdquo; I was secretly pleased - red seems a very silly color for panties to me and it always seems to cause rude comment among boys if discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nice, Nicky,&rdquo; laughed Aunt Sue. &ldquo;You know, when I was at school we all had to wear the ordinary school panties, the same color and pattern as the uniform. But some of us used to wear our own panties underneath, and we would go into the toilets at playtime and show each other what we had on. It was mostly white in those days, but some of us wore some very frilly things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last to arrive was the other new girl, Sally. I immediately thought Sally looked about the untidiest girl I had ever seen, and very little has happened since really to change my mind. She was wearing a royal blue dress that hung straight down from her shoulders like a sack, without any waist. Her hair was quite long and rather curly, but looked more like a bush than anything else. She had a big smile and was clearly not shy of me or anybody else. Her mother who dropped her off looked untidy as well, although very cheerful. Sally was soon giggling and squealing away with Laureen, and I thought the two of them made a good pair.</p>
<p>In between the girls arriving, I had given Shelley an idea of what we should all start off doing this morning, with strict instructions to all the girls that had been here on Saturday that nudism was not even to be mentioned for half an hour at least, and even then they were to ask me for permission before they decided on anything. I repeated that I thought Shelley had been unfair to ask Brenda and Sally round without telling them it was a nudist club, although Sally did not look the sort who minded. Aunt Sue agreed, and after Sally had arrived she climbed into her car and drove off to work, leaving us alone for the morning.</p>
<p>Sally had never been to Shelley&rsquo;s house before, so she demanded to see everything in the garden. We went around the front, and Sally immediately raced for the little climbing frame, swinging upside down from the top rail and laughing loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a hole in your panties,&rdquo; Laureen sang out as Sally swung over the top. Through a two-inch hole in her pink frilly underwear we could see the middle of the crack in her bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Sally laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so I can do a poo without taking my panties off!&rdquo; And she burst into silly giggles. This girl, I thought, was something else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Roy, let me tell Sally about our club,&rdquo; Shelley whispered to me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she wouldn&rsquo;t feel bad about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but Brenda might,&rdquo; I whispered back. Brenda was standing at the back, looking rather out of place.</p>
<p>They continued their tour of the front garden and Sally exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, you didn&rsquo;t tell me you have a pool! I didn&rsquo;t bring my costume!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shelley began to say, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need . . .&rdquo; but I gave her a hard nudge and she stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can swim in my panties,&rdquo; Sally continued happily. &ldquo;I swim in my bare bum at home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Shelley forgot herself and burst out, &ldquo;Oh, goody, so do we!</p>
<p>This is really a nudist club, you see, so . . .&rdquo; Then she remembered, too late.</p>
<p>I looked back quickly at Brenda, who was staring at them, looking startled. I glared at Shelley, who looked very crestfallen and guilty because she always tries to please me, and then said, &ldquo;In this place everybody can just wear whatever they want when they swim - it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know; I didn&rsquo;t bring my costume,&rdquo; whispered Brenda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, you can borrow Shelley&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re too shy to go without,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t swim just yet. We&rsquo;ll finish the tour of the garden and then see what you want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tour took quite a long time because the garden is about two acres in size and the back is an absolute jungle, apart from a small clearing outside the back door. When Shelley&rsquo;s family first moved into that house three years ago, they decided it was too expensive a task to have it cleared and employ enough workers to keep it cleared, so they just allowed it to grow. The grass is long and thick, but they have never seen a snake there, so the worries they had at first have gone. There must be hundreds of trees in there, including fruit trees, some growing together to form thickets.</p>
<p>Sometimes Shelley and I, along with my nine-year-old sister Jenny who was on camp at the time of this story, play hide-and-seek there, but it isn&rsquo;t a very popular game because it&rsquo;s so difficult to find anybody. I think Shelley still suspects there are wild animals living there.</p>
<p>Hardly likely, but there are hundreds of birds.</p>
<p>Sally especially was fascinated by this jungle and suggested hide-and- seek right away. We told her how difficult it was to find anybody, but the other visitors were also keen so we agreed to play it later.</p>
<p>When we got round to the front again, Shelley followed my next suggestion. &ldquo;Miss Beautiful Mini-Skirt competition!&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>We did it the same way that we had done on Saturday, with myself sitting in a deck chair as judge and using the area in front of the verandah as a stage. I took my shirt off as the first step of the day.</p>
<p>Shelley led the way in her dark blue mini-skirt, and I was relieved to see as she bent that she was indeed wearing panties, her usual rich white woolen ones that I like so much. As on the Saturday, she came down to sit on my lap and gave me a hug and a kiss when she finished, again taking a long time over her performance.</p>
<p>Sally, now she knew what to do, would not be stopped. She rushed on next and gave a fast and breathless performance in her blue shift, adding a handstand in the middle that collapsed and left me looking at those frilly, holey pink panties. When she finished, she leapt at me like an excited dog, jumping on my lap and giving me a tight hug round the neck and a wet kiss on my chin. Then she leaned back against my chest, and I could feel her hot little body as I held her.</p>
<p>Laureen followed, and her tiny dress proved as flimsy as it looked.</p>
<p>Every time she stretched, it rode up and revealed large areas of white skin almost up to her belly button, as I&rsquo;m sure she intended. She was no longer wearing the pink panties of Saturday but a very small pair of white briefs with purple stripes diagonally across them, just enough of it to cover her vagina and little more. Then she ran over, pushed Sally rather roughly out of the way and jumped on to my lap, giving me a hug, a kiss and a massive grin.</p>
<p>Nicky was next, with her short, tight black skirt. Her white panties flashed nicely under that skirt when she stretched or knelt, and when she turned round it was tight enough to see the outline of her panties before she even bent over. This time she wore a shiny white pair that looked as if they were made of silk, rather than the larger pale blue ones that had started such excitement on the Saturday. Then came Angela, her white pleated skirt flapping up, especially at the back.</p>
<p>When she knelt down with one knee up, spreading her arms wide, I could see a little red heart on the panties just where the top of her vagina would be at the front.</p>
<p>Brenda, it seemed, was not happy about going on by herself, so she went on with Lynn. Lynn was never likely to be a good example of modeling, although I did notice she was still wearing her panties as she moved. I was wondering what Brenda wore underneath, but she did not show anything. She just walked up and down, turning around once or twice.</p>
<p>However her violet top and purple skirt looked very attractive and swung nicely as she walked.</p>
<p>Now the show was over I had the winners to announce. Number three I named as Nicky, number two as Angela, and finally, &ldquo;Miss Beautiful Mini-skirt today is . . . Brenda!&rdquo; Looking surprised and rather nervous, Brenda came out to the front to collect her imaginary prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lovely skirt you&rsquo;re wearing; you look so pretty,&rdquo; I whispered to her, and she looked me in the eyes at last and gave a trembling smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she hardly did anything,&rdquo; complained Shelley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not judging on what people do, but on what people wear,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;This is Brenda&rsquo;s first time on parade, so give her a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was wrong with my mini-skirt?&rdquo; Laureen wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s supposed to be Miss Beautiful Mini-skirt, not Miss Beautiful Panties,&rdquo; I grinned, remembering Laureen saying exactly the same thing to Shelley on Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s have another Beautiful Panties competition,&rdquo; suggested Shelley eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later on,&rdquo; I said, knowing that Brenda at least was not ready for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were going to play with the costumes first.&rdquo; I thought that this would be a good way to prepare Brenda for it, as it had the other girls on Saturday.</p>
<p>The girls went opened the playhouse and dragged out the massive costume boxes, while I went inside for the first round of lemonade.</p>
<p>As I was pouring them in the kitchen, Laureen came in through the door with a big grin on her face. &ldquo;Just come to say hello,&rdquo; she said, and leapt into my arms, reaching up and holding on to me round the neck.</p>
<p>I staggered back, taken by surprise, putting the jug down with difficulty. Then I put my hands under Laureen&rsquo;s bottom to hold her up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind me holding you like this,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, burying her face in my shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because your dress is so short I can feel your panties,&rdquo; I explained.</p>
<p>Not that there was much of the panties either, and my hands felt more of the side of her bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, you can feel as much as you like,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;I want you to.&rdquo; I did so, rubbing my hands gently over her bottom as I held her. The pants were a little coarse, not in the same category as they had been on Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a look,&rdquo; Laureen invited me, scrambling down, turning round, lifting her skirt at the back and sticking her bottom out. They were white with purple stripes running diagonally across them, what little there was of them. At the back they seemed to disappear into her crack and I could not think they were very comfortable.</p>
<p>I gave her a gentle spank right in the middle, feeling the crack down the middle of her bottom as I did so. &ldquo;Anything else you want me to feel and see while I&rsquo;m at it?&rdquo; I grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she smiled, pulling her panties down at the back and revealing her bottom. I had noticed before that it did stick out a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said, rubbing my hands gently over her soft white flesh.</p>
<p>When I was satisfied I asked, &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, standing up and turning to face me. Her hands went up to the buttons on the front of her dress. Then suddenly she seemed to turn shy. She turned round, said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you later,&rdquo; and went back outside to her friends.</p>
<p>I brought the lemonade outside to find the girls again in various stages of undress. Laureen was ready for me, stark naked with the bikini in her hands, ready to put it on. Brenda, changed into a long green dress, gasped as I came out and placed her body in between myself and Laureen so I would not be able to see her naked, but I deliberately took no notice of either of them as I held the drinks for them to take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember on Saturday when Shelley spilt the lemonade down your underpants,&rdquo; Laureen reminded everyone with a giggle. She was now wearing the bikini.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the Superman costume, Roy,&rdquo; said Nicky, wearing only her white panties. She brought it over. &ldquo;Please put it on again,&rdquo; she said with a giggle.</p>
<p>One stage at a time, I thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that later,&rdquo; I promised. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t tried on that pirate costume yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found it for me, so I stripped down to my underpants. At this stage I looked at Brenda and told her how nice she looked. She smiled with a bit of embarrassment to see me almost naked, but I knew that she would soon get over it as I showed I didn&rsquo;t care. Then I put on the pirate suit. It was not very exciting, so I took it off again and found the kilt. Again the girls got me to do a Highland fling for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the Superman costume,&rdquo; said Nicky firmly, handing it to me. I couldn&rsquo;t very well back down now, as I was carefully training Brenda, who still had not changed out of her dress. The girls gathered round, and I suspected this would now become a regular club joke.</p>
<p>I took off my underpants and, with a grin on my face, tried again to put on the bottom part. There were squeals of laughter as it got stuck again at the top of my legs and I could not get it over my penis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us help you,&rdquo; decided Laureen. &ldquo;Come on, girls.&rdquo; She reached out, put her thumb under the tight elastic of the bottoms and pulled. Some of the other girls gathered round to help. Laureen put her other hand in to help as well, pushing it against my penis as she did so. All the girls pulled upwards, but could not shift it, until the elastic suddenly broke.</p>
<p>I could now pull them up more, just enough to cover my penis, and they were tight enough not to fall down. I glanced at Brenda and saw her watching with a stunned look on her face. As I put the top on, I saw her unbutton her dress and slip it off down her body, showing me for the first time her flimsy pale yellow panties.</p>
<p>After some more dressing up, Angela called for another Miss Beautiful Costume competition, which we had, and was won by Laureen in an elegant evening gown. Then the call went up for Miss Beautiful Panties. I still wasn&rsquo;t sure about Brenda but couldn&rsquo;t hold the girls off any longer. I was ready to insist that Brenda stay out of it if she didn&rsquo;t want to take part. I had by now replaced the Superman costume with my own underpants, as they were more comfortable. I was surprised to find myself enjoying more and more the interested glances and admiration the girls threw at my penis whenever I changed; as mine was the only one, it made me feel special.</p>
<p>I told Shelley at the start that she could not be Miss Beautiful Panties again, as she was wearing the same sort of panties as she had done on the Saturday, but she would still be allowed to do her act.</p>
<p>Brenda was quite happy now to join in with her little pale yellow panties pulled up high over her skinny tummy. Rebecca was unable to come and Laureen&rsquo;s panties were not very good quality, so there would be some completely new winners this time. I gave it some thought.</p>
<p>Eventually I awarded it to Nicky, followed by Angela and then Sally, saying that apart from the hole she had a very admirable pair. Again I explained that I was not counting Lynn, although she had remembered to bring with her some very fine panties!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; agreed Laureen, reaching out, grabbing hold of the hole in Sally&rsquo;s panties and pulling downwards. Sally&rsquo;s little white bottom flashed into view, and she squealed, turned round and tried to pull Laureen&rsquo;s down. But Laureen was already pulling them off herself, and again my heart skipped a beat as I caught my first sight of the day of that adorable vagina. Laureen laughed loudly and danced away, waving her panties above her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cheating!&rdquo; shouted Sally, standing there with her bottom still exposed. A moment later Nicky had pulled the panties down further, and she then had to grab Sally&rsquo;s arms as Sally tried to return the compliment. By now Sally&rsquo;s panties were down by her knees but her back was to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Sally, everybody!&rdquo; shouted Laureen, jumping on her friend and pulling the panties to her ankles. Sally whirled round, and I had my first view of her soft white vagina.</p>
<p>She was taking it in very good spirit, so I had not stopped the other girls, but Brenda was another matter. Lynn put an arm protectively around her, but Sally shouted, &ldquo;Get Brenda now!&rdquo; Brenda whimpered and clung to Lynn.</p>
<p>I quickly stepped forward and shouted, &ldquo;No, stop!&rdquo; The girls took notice at once, so I put my hand on Brenda&rsquo;s shoulder and just said, &ldquo;This sort of game is only for those who want to play it, and Brenda doesn&rsquo;t, so you must leave her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicky, then!&rdquo; shouted Laureen, pulling at Nicky&rsquo;s white panties.</p>
<p>Screaming and laughing, Nicky was lifted off the ground and her panties removed while she struggled and kicked. Angela did not wait for her turn, but removed hers of her own accord. All naked now, they turned and ran for the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to swim, Brenda?&rdquo; asked Lynn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not . . . not naked,&rdquo; whispered Brenda. &ldquo;And if I use my panties someone may pull them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while I&rsquo;m there,&rdquo; I promised her, but Lynn was already saying, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you change into that bikini from the costumes? That should be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brenda nodded, but shot a glance at me, so I took off my underpants and followed the girls to the pool, careful not to look back. It was essential to win her trust. When I reached the pool, I quietly warned the girls to leave Brenda alone when she came.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Brenda, wearing the bikini, and Lynn, wearing her smile and her skin, came over to the pool. Brenda had perhaps been coached by Lynn, because she stood at the side of the pool and shouted, &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; Some of them stopped and turned, and Brenda, smiling, called out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wearing the costume from the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynn had been right. The girls had accepted it and some of them wondered why they hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. As Brenda slid into the pool, Angela said, &ldquo;I wish we could have a Miss Beautiful Bikini competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh, I think we can!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Shelley. &ldquo;Roy!&rdquo; She swam over to me and whispered in my ear.</p>
<p>I nodded and replied, &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see after the swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the swim we all went to lie in the early morning sun, which was still not too hot. I lay on my back with my limp penis between my legs and gazed at the feminine beauty around me. Truly little naked girls are the most beautiful sight in the world, if only they all realized that.</p>
<p>Laureen and Sally were wrestling and giggling together, and it was a feast for the eyes to watch their legs waving up and down, sometimes spread and sometimes straight. Angela lay next to me, and I admired the soft smooth curve all the way down from her tummy and the gentle folds of skin between her legs. Nicky was idly tickling her vagina with a stalk of grass, and giggling to herself and wriggling in a very exciting manner.</p>
<p>Then Shelley came over and sat down between my legs, holding on to them and laying her head back on my tummy. I could feel my penis against her back, and hoped it was going to stay still. Angela also moved closer at that, resting her head on my chest.</p>
<p>I looked around for Lynn and Brenda. They were sitting together behind me, to the left, talking quietly. Lynn had her left leg on the ground and her right knee up, showing a wonderful expanse in between. Then I suddenly noticed that Brenda had taken the bikini off and was now as naked as the rest of us. She was still rather uncomfortable with it, though, as she was sitting hunched up with her knees tightly drawn up and her chin on the top of them, but at the bottom by her heels I could just make out the lovely little bulge and the tail end of her vagina.</p>
<p>She was lovely! As I gazed on her, my heart felt very warm and protective towards her. She was now one of mine!</p>
<p>After a few minutes Sally suddenly stood up and announced, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re now going to play hide-and-seek! Blocks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blocks!&rdquo; we all shouted.</p>
<p>According to local rules at the English school, the last person to shout &lsquo;Blocks&rsquo; is the one who has to catch or do whatever else nobody else really wants to do. Every time our family has a meal with Shelley&rsquo;s family, even if it is a barbecue, Shelley always shouts at the end of the meal, &ldquo;Blocks clearing the table!&rdquo; Unfortunately for her, her family doesn&rsquo;t play by English school rules and she usually has to lend a hand anyway.</p>
<p>Lynn was only vaguely aware of this &lsquo;rule&rsquo;, and so she was later than everyone else to call out &ldquo;Blocks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynn, you&rsquo;re It!&rdquo; Sally told her. &ldquo;You have to find us all. You have ten minutes on my watch to find us, and your score is the number of people you catch in that time. Girls, when you&rsquo;re caught, come back to the pool. We&rsquo;ll take it in turns to catch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brenda, do you want to come with me?&rdquo; asked Lynn kindly. When Brenda, still cuddling her knees tightly, nodded, Lynn said in her stilted English, &ldquo;Brenda and I will catch together. We will stay with each other so that it is fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All were agreed, so we put on our shoes as the ground would be rough at the back, but no other clothing. Lynn and Brenda turned towards a tree and began to count clearly, while the rest of us all took off down the side of the house for the massive back garden. Having played with Shelley at times, I knew the best places to hide and headed for my first place, plunging into the long grass. Then, when I turned round, I saw all the girls following me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, spread out,&rdquo; I whispered to them. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of room here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to come with you,&rdquo; Shelley whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I.&rdquo; &ldquo;And me,&rdquo; came several voices.</p>
<p>I laughed at them, and said, &ldquo;Look, you can&rsquo;t all come. That would spoil the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take it in turns, then,&rdquo; decided Nicky. &ldquo;I bag first turn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m first,&rdquo; argued Shelley, holding me tightly round the waist as though I were her own private property.</p>
<p>An argument began, and I had to break in and say, &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to find some way to work this out. But Lynn and Brenda will be coming soon, so we haven&rsquo;t time now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were just beginning to come up with ideas when we heard dimly Lynn&rsquo;s voice from the front garden: &ldquo;Coming, ready or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go back and start again while we sort this out,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>We plunged back through the grass just in time to see Lynn and Brenda coming round the corner of the house. When Brenda saw me coming, she shyly put a hand down between her legs as cover and hung behind Lynn.</p>
<p>I explained the situation to Lynn, and then Shelley explained to me how they were going to decide who came with me first. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all chosen a number between one and five,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now you choose one of those numbers and the person whose number it is goes with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take number five, then,&rdquo; I decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh, that&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; smiled Angela quietly, blushing as usual. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky thing,&rdquo; said Laureen enviously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll all get your turn,&rdquo; I grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Angela, you&rsquo;re It when Lynn and Brenda have found everybody,&rdquo; said Shelley.</p>
<p>Again we set off while Lynn and Brenda counted. This time all the girls spread out, looking for good hiding places, while Angela followed close behind me as I knew where we were going for our first place. It would be a tight fit, but we would be well hidden.</p>
<h5 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#chapter-6">#</a></h5>
<p>I plowed through the long grass towards the very back of the garden, with Angela following me. I knew there was quite a large hole under a pile of logs in the far corner, and I was sure Lynn and Brenda would not be able to find us there.</p>
<p>It was not very easy scrambling through the jungle without the protection of clothes. I scraped my testicles climbing over a low branch, but gritted my teeth against the pain rather than let Angela know. We had to hurry, not knowing exactly how long it would be before the search began. Over to our right I could hear the low voices of the other girls as they looked for places to hide.</p>
<p>At last we arrived at the pile of logs in a small clearing. I bent down and showed Angela the small hole by the closest log. &ldquo;In here,&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>Angela looked at it with her gentle blue eyes, and then at me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very big,&rdquo; she whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bigger inside,&rdquo; I said, scrambling down through the gap. It was about three feet wide and three feet high. I sat at one side, knees under my chin and waited for Angela to scramble down.</p>
<p>There was not too much room for her, and she put first her right leg and then her left inside. Then she squatted, stretching her right leg across as she moved in. I held my breath as I feasted my eyes on her beautiful little vagina, only a foot in front of me. She put her head inside, opposite me, and sat down with a slight bump, knees up and legs apart. I could see that lovely little slit from top to bottom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s strange how girls can go so quickly from modesty or shyness to complete trust. I looked lovingly at Angela sitting opposite me, only a few inches away. Two days earlier she would never have shared her nakedness with me, yet now she seemed quite unaware of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel squashed,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; I whispered back, moving my legs over hers. We were sitting now with faces less than a foot apart, and my penis almost touching her vagina. I smiled at her. She liked to pretend to be so composed, but she was really a very emotional girl - or was it just that she was in love with me? I took my elbows off my knees and gently cupped her face in my hands, kissing her gently. She blushed furiously I could see even in the dim light of the hole, but smiled at me very shyly but very lovingly. In the distance I thought I could hear Lynn&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p>I pulled her a little closer. She put her arms round my neck and placed her cheek against mine. I could now feel my penis throbbing just under her bottom. I held her sweet little body close to mine, skin against skin, and it was lovely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know something, Angela?&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angela stirred against me and I wondered what she was feeling. This time I could feel her cheek hotly against mine. Then she replied in a trembling voice, &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so pretty,&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;And such a lovely person. You know, whenever you want me, I&rsquo;ll be there for you.&rdquo; I told her where my house was, and kept on whispering sweet nothings into her ear. She cuddled me tightly and responded to my kisses. I could feel her smooth skin pressed against my cheek, my arms, my chest, my stomach and my bulging penis. But I would never abuse this sweet, innocent girl.</p>
<p>Then I heard could hear a rustling in the jungle just above us and heard the murmur of voices. Lynn and Brenda were coming our way. I whispered to Angela to stay quiet, and we waited. They headed for the log pile and walked round it in case anyone was behind it. I could see Brenda standing almost above us, her thin legs meeting at the top in a tight little vagina, the first good view I had had of her. If she had looked down I&rsquo;m sure she would have seen us, but she was looking round her instead. They saw nothing and soon moved off.</p>
<p>We waited, and then we heard a yell of triumph from perhaps thirty yards away. It was Sally. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ten minutes and nobody found me! All right, everybody, you can come out now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling, we emerged from our hole, and immediately saw we were quite dirty from the slightly damp soil. We made our way back to the pool, stopping to wash ourselves on the way. Angela crouched down by a tap and I washed her back, bottom and legs as well as I could, and she did the same to me. That was why we were last back at the pool, to see that Lynn and Brenda had only been able to find Laureen. The girls were waiting impatiently for me to choose another number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angela, you&rsquo;re chasing now,&rdquo; Shelley told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roy, will you come with me?&rdquo; asked Angela, looking pleadingly into my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, those are the rules,&rdquo; decided Shelley. &ldquo;Roy must now choose a number for someone else to hide with him. Any number except five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right - number one,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; screamed Laureen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Angela counted, I led the way to my next hiding place, with Laureen keeping very close behind me. This one was a thicket. There were several bushes all very close together, growing so thickly that it was impossible to see into them. But once somebody plunged inside, there was an open place about two yards wide with plenty of room to hide.</p>
<p>I led the way, plunging through the thick leaves and twigs into the open space. There was a small pool of sunlight, and I sat down in it on a thick pile of dead leaves. Laureen looked delighted as she flopped full length next to me and then rolled over on her side, propping herself up on one elbow. &ldquo;This is like a little house,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>The bushes around grew so thickly that it was impossible to see more than a few spots of light the other side. Nobody who didn&rsquo;t know it existed could think of finding anybody there.</p>
<p>I lay back, and Laureen turned and laid her head back on my chest. I&rsquo;m sure she must have heard my heart pounding as I gazed down the length of her body. I could see down her slim neck to those two little mounds on her chest with clear nipples on top. Then down her pale white stomach to her loins, down to her groin, but from my position not quite far enough to see any further. I gave her shoulder a gentle rub with my hand.</p>
<p>After a moment she sat up and looked at me challengingly. &ldquo;Close your eyes,&rdquo; she instructed. I did so. She took my hand and moved it, putting it down on a small soft lump. &ldquo;Feel it,&rdquo; she ordered.</p>
<p>I felt her little breast gently with my fingers. Firm on top, but wobbly as I stroked it. Not knowing how much it would hurt, I rubbed and felt very carefully. Then she moved my hand over to the other one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these things?&rdquo; I asked, still with my eyes shut and pretending not to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you ever felt a boob before?&rdquo; came Laureen&rsquo;s voice, pretending to scold. &ldquo;All right, you can open your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gently I pulled her under the shoulders to move her up and across my chest, with her fair hair resting under my chin. Then I put my arms round her, one hand on each breast, and stroked gently. It felt so good, and I suspected she was watching to see what effect this had on my penis.</p>
<p>All was quiet around us. After a while Laureen told me a second time, &ldquo;Close your eyes.&rdquo; Then she took my right hand and moved it again, pulling it almost to the full length of my arm. Then she put it down again, placing it carefully. I could feel something warm and soft and slightly damp that went down in the middle and ended between two long soft poles. I ran my finger very lightly up and down the middle, and Laureen giggled and jerked her body suddenly. &ldquo;That tickles,&rdquo; she giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked her.</p>
<p>Laureen put her head back and I could feel her warm breath in my ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very special reward,&rdquo; she breathed, so quietly I could hardly hear her and very unlike her usual strident tone. &ldquo;Stroke the little pussy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and stared at her, pretending to be horrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laureen!&rdquo; I breathed in a shocked tone. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laureen began to give a squeal of laughter and then strangled it quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all yours today,&rdquo; she whispered, putting an arm round my neck and pulling her body further up so that her vagina was more easily within my reach. &ldquo;Tickle me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did, rubbing those little folds of skin very lightly with my fingers, each time causing her body to jerk and her mouth to splutter as she choked back her giggles. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve finished it&rsquo;s my turn,&rdquo; she whispered to me. I did not really want to let this precocious girl loose on my penis, so I hoped I could stretch out &lsquo;my turn&rsquo; as long as possible.</p>
<p>As I moved my fingers slowly lower, caressing gently, the wriggles and giggles increased. She lay back with her legs open and her little breasts about six inches from my face, kicking and giving little moans as my fingers explored the bottom-most part between her legs. Then I seemed to find a particularly sensitive part, as she gave a sudden sharp jerk backwards and a muffled shriek.</p>
<p>At that moment I heard a voice a few yards away from us, on the other side of the bushes. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; called Angela. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laureen clamped her hand over her mouth and stared at me in horror, eyes filled with guilt. Then slowly she seemed to realize that she had only been heard and Angela could not have known what we were doing. But we froze, hoping Angela would not know where the sound had come from.</p>
<p>We heard a rustling of leaves and saw some twigs move. After a few seconds Angela broke through and stared at us. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught you!&rdquo; she exclaimed in glee. Then she looked around and said, &ldquo;This is just like a little cave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caught, we followed her out and then made our way back towards the pool, with Laureen looking very disappointed. I had mixed feelings, wondering just how far Laureen would have gone had she not given the game away. I felt rich warmth in my loins from the memory of what we had done together, but was in a way relieved that she had not been able to let herself loose on my private parts.</p>
<p>We found Nicky there already, caught by Angela. We had a quick dip in the pool before we heard Sally&rsquo;s triumphant cry announcing that ten minutes were up and she still hadn&rsquo;t been caught. All the girls returned, but were thirsty, so we had another drink. Then I chose number four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, me, me!&rdquo; squealed Nicky, bouncing up and down like a two-year-old, then wrapping her arms found my waist and putting her curly head against my chest. We made for the back while Laureen counted, Nicky still holding on to my hand.</p>
<p>This time we made for a tree. There were several mulberry trees only about twenty yards from the back door but the leaves, used to feed Shelley&rsquo;s silkworms, were so thick that it was impossible to see up into the branches. The ground was thick with fallen mulberries and our feet were immediately stained purple. I put my hand against the trunk of one a little further in. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up here,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;Can you climb it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may need help,&rdquo; she said, looking at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you want me to do,&rdquo; I whispered, not wanting to touch a naked body without permission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift me up,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I knelt down, put my arms round her thighs and my shoulder under her bottom, and gently lifted her up so she could stand in the fork of the tree. I soon realized I had chosen the wrong girl to hide with in a tree. Nicky is such a little beauty that I think her parents had brought her up to be very ladylike, and she seemed to have no idea at all about climbing trees. She stood in the fork looking helpless until I told her where to put her foot next. She was still struggling when we heard Laureen call and we were still not hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quickly,&rdquo; I hissed, putting a hand under her bottom and hoisting her up to a strong branch. She struggled clumsily to find something to hold on to. &ldquo;Hold the trunk,&rdquo; I hissed, clambering up after her. I pulled myself quickly on to the next branch, about three feet above her head, and squatted. My left arm was wrapped around the trunk and my penis dangled between my legs.</p>
<p>I reached a hand down. &ldquo;Grab my hand,&rdquo; I told her. When she put a hand up, I reached down full length, grabbed her firmly around the wrist and then stood up, hauling her bodily up to the branch with me.</p>
<p>She squealed quietly and looked at me in wonder with those big beautiful hazel eyes. &ldquo;Gee, you&rsquo;re strong!&rdquo; she said in awe, sitting next to me on the branch, her leg against mine.</p>
<p>We still weren&rsquo;t quite out of sight so I whispered, &ldquo;Next branch. Stand up.&rdquo; I had chosen the wrong tree as well as the wrong girl. This one did not have enough branches close to the ground. Nicky immediately put one mulberry-stained foot on the next branch while I held her, stretching her leg high to reach it.</p>
<p>At that moment I could see between the branches Laureen making her way quietly through the trees, on a course that would take her close to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; I whispered, and Nicky froze while I held her tightly.</p>
<p>I watched as Laureen crept stealthily almost underneath us, looking this way and that but never thinking to look upwards. I turned back to Nicky, and suddenly realized what I could see. There, a few inches away from my eyes, was the most perfect little vagina you could imagine, stretched slightly open to reveal a darker pink and little folds of flesh and membrane inside. I gazed enraptured, a warm smile taking over my face. She was indeed a little beauty in every way. Only with great difficulty did I stop myself from kissing her there.</p>
<p>She was looking down at me with a white face, though. We were more than three yards above the ground and she was frightened, unused to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one more branch,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please help me up,&rdquo; she whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I push you here?&rdquo; I asked, indicating the place under her crotch but not wanting to touch without permission. I couldn&rsquo;t in fact see any other way to hoist her up from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered, so I put one hand underneath, trying to avoid putting pressure on her vagina, and pushed gently, steadying her with my other hand. She scrambled up rather clumsily, sitting on the branch and holding to the trunk for dear life. Keeping a hand on her still, I lifted myself up next to her.</p>
<p>I saw little tears welling over her eyelids and rolling down her pretty face. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, darling?&rdquo; I whispered, using a pet name without even thinking about it and putting an arm tightly round her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hurt me,&rdquo; she whispered. With my arm round her, she let go of the trunk with one hand and clutched her hurting vagina, doubling up a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I would never ever want to do that,&rdquo; I whispered, full of tenderness, kissing her gently on the cheek. She didn&rsquo;t respond, but I held her closely, pressing my cheek against hers. About a minute later, as the pain wore off. She looked at me and smiled, her big eyes still damp. I reached up a finger and gently dabbed away a teardrop from her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; I whispered back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; she responded, laying her golden head on my shoulder.</p>
<p>I laid a hand gently round the back of her head and kissed her again.</p>
<p>Again my heart and my loins warmed with the pleasure of this moment.</p>
<p>A few minutes later we heard a wail of frustration from Sally, caught for the first time, and a yell of triumph from Laureen. It was not long afterwards that we heard Sally, from the direction of the pool this time, call for time up. I climbed down the tree first, bit by bit, and helped Nicky down from each branch. So often I reached up for her, finding her legs open before me and her arms round my neck as I helped her down. At the bottom she reached up to put her arms round my neck and we had another good hug, the warm skin of our chests pressing against each other. &ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; I whispered, smiling into her blue eyes. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that you were always safe with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were the last to arrive back at the pool, due to the time taken climbing down the tree. Angela and Lynn had been caught as well as Sally, and I chose number three. Sally gave a squeal and Shelley a groan, and I took Sally with some misgivings.</p>
<p>My three best hiding places had been used, but the others didn&rsquo;t know that - or some of them didn&rsquo;t, anyway. &ldquo;Take me where you took Laureen,&rdquo; demanded Sally, holding my hand and looking up at me with her wide, baby-blue eyes, her untidy hair spread all over a dirty but attractive face. I thought to myself that this girl may be a bit of a terror, but at least everything about her was straight-forward and honest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go in the same place again; we&rsquo;ll be found,&rdquo; I protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can; no, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; pouted Sally firmly. She swung behind me and grabbed me by the shoulders. &ldquo;Piggy-back! Up!&rdquo; She leapt up and threw her arms round my neck, while I grabbed her round her legs. &ldquo;Gee up, horsey!&rdquo; she cried, giving me a smacking kiss by my ear.</p>
<p>I carried her all the way to the little thicket and crouched to go inside with her on my back. She squealed and ducked her head to avoid the low branches. I suddenly wished I had been firm about finding somewhere else. Alone in here with Sally could be dangerous.</p>
<p>I slipped her down behind me, and she lay on her back with her legs curled up under her chin, so I could see everything from her cute bottom to the mound where her vagina ended, all the way up like a zip fastener to the top. My penis began to respond, so I sat down at an angle to try to cover it.</p>
<p>Sally sat up, with her knees up and well apart so as to give me the best possible view of her vagina. It was wide open, gaping, with a dark moist pink color inside. She bent her head between her legs to look herself, and then looked up at me again, with a challenging look of daring and excitement on her face. Was she trying to shock or embarrass me? I didn&rsquo;t know, but decided to play it cool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nice,&rdquo; I said casually. &ldquo;Do you always show boys what you look like inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally giggled. &ldquo;Only boys I like,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let me show you how I did a wee-wee when I was little.&rdquo; She shot a little jet of urine from her vagina towards me for a moment, and repeated it several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remind me not to sit there,&rdquo; I said, turning my eyes away to stare through the leaves in case Nicky was looking for us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look what I can do,&rdquo; said Sally. I turned to see her licking a finger and then pushing it in and out of her vagina, holding it open wider still with her other hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could have sex in here, you know,&rdquo; Sally said in a very precocious way. &ldquo;And nobody would find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever had sex before?&rdquo; I asked her, still playing it cool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, a few times,&rdquo; she claimed, but her open face showed quite clearly that this was not true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who with?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some boys,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Do you want me to show you how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought that was enough. I was sorely tempted, but my sense of responsibility, and perhaps fear, took over. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m not going to have sex with you,&rdquo; I told her firmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the law, because you&rsquo;re too young.&rdquo; (So was I, but that was beside the point.) &ldquo;It would be an awful thing to have sex with you when I&rsquo;m supposed to be looking after you. Now behave yourself properly. That&rsquo;s a very stupid and naughty way to behave with a boy, and you could easily do it with a boy who would hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To my astonishment, Sally looked completely shocked. She stared at me in horror with wide open eyes. Big tears welled up and rolled down her cheeks. She suddenly looked so pitiful and ashamed. She certainly wasn&rsquo;t putting on an act. Once again my feeling for helpless females rose to the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Sally,&rdquo; I said gently, holding out my arms to her.</p>
<p>With tears still falling, Sally shuffled obediently over to me, looking at me all the time with big mournful eyes. I sat her on my thigh and put my arms round her gently. She buried her face in my shoulder and I could feel her body heaving as she sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Sally,&rdquo; I whispered in her ear, and spoke slowly and gently to her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to get hurt. I would never ever do anything to harm you, but other people might. I love the way you are so full of fun and friendliness. Being naked is wonderful and good fun. But it&rsquo;s not good to show off your body and think about having sex. It&rsquo;s too dangerous. I want to look after you and protect you. But I can&rsquo;t always do that, so you must look after yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her body stopped heaving, but her face remained buried in my shoulder and I wondered what she was thinking. After about a minute she finally raised her head and looked at me with her dirty, tear-stained face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she whispered. I gave her a gentle kiss on the nose, and slowly saw her face light up. &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she said, giving me a smacking wet kiss on the cheek. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind you seeing my pussy because I trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she was back to her usual happy self, but somehow different, without so much silliness. She chattered away in my ear, probably about her family or school or something, but I was hardly listening, just enjoying the protective love I suddenly felt for her.</p>
<p>She lay back with her head on my shoulder and took my hand. She guided it downwards to that secret place between her legs and placed it on her vagina. &ldquo;Please stroke me,&rdquo; she whispered, turning her head to look at me pleadingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, as you&rsquo;re so much more sweet and sensible now,&rdquo; I whispered, stroking her gently, feeling with my fingertips her little mound and the soft warm slit in between.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, a look of intense pleasure on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmmmmmmmmm!&rdquo; she hummed, and wriggled gently with ecstasy. &ldquo;I love it when you do this to me,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Tickle me too.&rdquo; I did so gently, and she wriggled and giggled most delightfully. I kissed her cheek gently, and she gave me a wet, dirty, sticky kiss in return.</p>
<p>Then suddenly she remembered and looked at her watch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had three minutes extra!&rdquo; she squealed, leaping up and dashing out through the bushes. &ldquo;Yippee!&rdquo; I heard her yelling. &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up and nobody&rsquo;s found me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed her out through the thicket, grinning. She grabbed me by the hand and started dragging me towards the pool. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better wash your face first or everyone will know you&rsquo;ve been crying,&rdquo; I told her. We stopped by a tap and she let me wash all the tears and grime off her face gently. I tried to pull her untidy hair back, but as soon as I let go it just flopped back again. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get a stapler for your hair,&rdquo; I joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What number?&rdquo; shouted out Shelley, jumping up and down, as we got back, to find that this time Brenda and Angela had been caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number six,&rdquo; I called out teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a six - it&rsquo;s me, number two,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; As we trotted off round the back of the house, Shelley whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a good idea. Let&rsquo;s just sit on the back doorstep!</p>
<p>I bet Sally will never think of looking for us there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll see us when she comes round the corner,&rdquo; I argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t; you don&rsquo;t know Sally,&rdquo; giggled Shelley. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather doubtful, I followed her over to the back door, about fifteen yards along the wall of the house from the corner. It was partly hidden by a flower bed, but nobody looking in that direction could fail to see us.</p>
<p>We waited a short while, then heard Sally&rsquo;s yell: &ldquo;Coming, ready or not!&rdquo; Moments later she came racing round the corner of the house, across the small back lawn and plunging into the jungle without so much as a glance round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Told you!&rdquo; giggled Shelley. She had been right.</p>
<p>After a moment Shelley stood up and came to sit on my lap, legs apart and facing me. She looked serious. I put my hands on her hips and rubbed her up and down gently. Then I asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Shell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roy,&rdquo; she said, slowly and thoughtfully. She paused. &ldquo;Roy, do you love the other girls more than me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled gently at her, shaking my head. I was sure she meant her friends rather than Lynn, as she had never shown any jealousy of Lynn, recognizing it was a different relationship. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I replied, moving my arms up under her shoulders to rub the back of her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody can ever take the place of my little cousin. You&rsquo;re always going to be special to me. But I like your friends too, so I&rsquo;m just spending time getting to know them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shelley put her face close to mine, smiling into my eyes. &ldquo;Just testing you,&rdquo; she said, but I knew it was more than that. She leaned back with her eyes shut, head back until she almost touched the ground with her head while I held her. She may be my cousin, but it still warms me to see her vagina open so trustingly like that. Then I pulled her up and we sat and waited, Shelley&rsquo;s head on my shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my friends are in love with you,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>It was probably true, I thought. I had never rated myself as being particularly good-looking, but I realized it was more than that. Was it because I was always gentle with them? Because I made them feel beautiful? Because I made them feel safe? Because I trusted them as well, even with my own nudity?</p>
<p>As we sat there, first Brenda and then Nicky walked past us to the pool, having been caught. They both saw us, but we put our fingers to our lips to keep them quiet.</p>
<p>Then at last we heard Sally calling from the depths of the jungle, &ldquo;Ten minutes and I&rsquo;ve found two people. Come out, everybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait till she comes back,&rdquo; laughed Shelley.</p>
<p>A minute later Sally came into sight, walking out of the jungle. She saw us immediately, and stopped and stared. &ldquo;Hey, what are you doing there?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were here all the time!&rdquo; laughed Shelley, standing up and clapping her hands with glee. &ldquo;You ran right past us and you didn&rsquo;t even see us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once, Sally was almost speechless. Then she had a good giggle about it as we returned to the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s Lynn&rsquo;s and Brenda&rsquo;s turn to go with Roy,&rdquo; said Shelley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three is too many, I think,&rdquo; smiled Lynn. &ldquo;I can stay out this time.</p>
<p>Brenda, will you go with Roy?&rdquo; She smiled at me. &ldquo;We can hide together when we get home,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Brenda looked at me rather timidly, unable to make up her mind. I smiled at her encouragingly. &ldquo;Please come with me, Brenda,&rdquo; I asked her. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t have to if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brenda turned to Lynn and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; She smiled up at me rather tremblingly, and then put her cold little hand into mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find a tree to climb,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Shelley knows this garden so well she knows all the other hiding places, but it will take her a bit longer to look in all the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brenda nodded confidently, and I quickly found she was a very good tree climber. I watched her climb nimbly up a tall tree near the back fence, moving easily from branch to branch and giving heart-warming glimpses of her vagina between her legs. I did not choose a mulberry tree as I was sure Shelley would look there first, but not too many of the others had thick enough leaves. Often hiders could get away with a rather bare tree, though, as the seekers often forgot to look upwards.</p>
<p>We sat over the leafiest part on the tree we could find, and I asked Brenda if she often climbed trees. In a quiet whisper she told me about her old house in England where they lived before moving out here, and how it was next to a wood where she often climbed with her older brothers and sisters. She was the youngest of a large family, and it seemed to me as if she had been rather ignored. We straddled the branch facing each other, and she now seemed quite unconcerned about my exposed penis or her own vagina, small and tight.</p>
<p>From where we sat we could see glimpses of Shelley rummaging through the bushes, knowing the most likely hiding places and finding the others one by one. She also remembered to look into trees, but the ten minutes were almost up, and we were just wondering if we might avoid being caught, when she came our way, scanning the trees, and quickly saw us. &ldquo;Roy, Brenda, got you!&rdquo; she screamed at the top of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s everybody! I&rsquo;ve won!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started to move down the tree, but Brenda said, &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; I stopped and looked at her, smiling. She hesitated and then said, &ldquo;I - I want to kiss you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On one condition,&rdquo; I told her gently. &ldquo;On condition I kiss you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer she put one arm round my neck, holding on to the tree with the other, and gave me a sweet little kiss on the cheek. I gave her a warm one in return, and she broke into a brilliant smile.</p>
<p>When we returned to the pool, the others told her that she hadn&rsquo;t won yet as I had not yet been It. &ldquo;All right, then, last round,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;Roy, let me seek with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a loud clamor of girls all wanting to seek with me, but I solved it by saying that wouldn&rsquo;t be fair and I would seek alone. I put my face to the tree, closed my eyes and counted to two hundred before calling out and going on my search.</p>
<p>It was very quiet, and at first I was puzzled as I searched here and there, including the mulberry trees. But I could not find any girl anywhere. Suddenly I wondered if they were perhaps all hiding together.</p>
<p>That would not surprise me, and there was only one place where they could be.</p>
<p>As silently as possible, I moved towards that little thicket. I was so quiet that as I stopped next to it I could hear a very faint murmur of voices from within. But quietly as I tried to push my way in, I could not help rustling branches and all fell immediately silent.</p>
<p>I pushed my way through the brush and put my head through into the open space. I saw seven little bodies, curled up flat on the ground, still and silent. They could all have been asleep the way they looked. The nearest one was Nicky. I reached out my hand and gently tickled the sole of her foot.</p>
<p>The silence was broken. Nicky jumped and screamed, and then laughed hard. The others all got a fright at the scream, and jumped up with squeals of their own. I leapt into the middle of them, wrestling gently with any body in my way. Then they recovered and all dived on top of me. I gave up and lay on my back, with seven delightful girls pinning me down and laughing at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tickle him!&rdquo; shouted Nicky. They all tried, but I am not very ticklish and they didn&rsquo;t have the technique, so it had little effect.</p>
<p>Laureen let out a deep breath. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s been a wonderful morning,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drinks, then,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Help me up.&rdquo; I held out my arms and, giggling, the girls pulled me to my feet, with Lynn and Sally pushing from behind as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what shall we do?&rdquo; asked Angela on our way back to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Beautiful Skins!&rdquo; shouted Nicky, who had won on Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Beautiful Boobs and Pussy,&rdquo; giggled Laureen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be easy,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;unless you all wear different skins from the ones you wore on Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have Miss Beautiful Bikini,&rdquo; suggested Shelley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that because we&rsquo;ve only one bikini,&rdquo; said Angela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can make bikinis for everybody,&rdquo; announced Shelley. &ldquo;Purple mulberry bikinis! I&rsquo;ll tell you how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Part 7</p>
<p>We had our drinks while Shelley talked excitedly about her idea. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s called body painting,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll use mulberry juice.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll pick up all the mulberries lying on the ground and make them into juice. Then we can paint bikinis on ourselves and have a Miss Beautiful Bikini competition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls all loved the idea. &ldquo;And you must do it as well, Roy,&rdquo; insisted Shelley, supported by the others. &ldquo;And Lynn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After drinks we all began to move outside to the mulberry trees. &ldquo;What shall we put the juice in?&rdquo; asked Laureen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get some jars from the cupboard,&rdquo; said Shelley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t hold very much juice,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Can you think of anything bigger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t, so I made my suggestion. &ldquo;Perhaps we can get that wheelbarrow out of your shed and fill it with mulberries. Then we can take it in turns to get in the wheelbarrow and stomp all the juice out of the mulberries. We&rsquo;ll get plenty that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls looked at each other, eyes shining. They liked that idea. We opened the shed and I trundled the barrow to the trees with difficulty, because they all wanted a ride in it. Then we set to loading the barrow with mulberries.</p>
<p>When it was half full, I said, &ldquo;That should be enough for everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now over to the pool,&rdquo; said Shelley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether your mum and dad would want a purple lawn,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I think we had better do the stomping somewhere over here where it doesn&rsquo;t matter if we spray mulberries everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saw the sense of that, so we wheeled the barrow into a little clearing. &ldquo;Me first!&rdquo; shouted Shelley. I held the barrow steady while she trod on the mulberries, carefully at first but then gaining in confidence. Soon she was leaping up and down, dancing and singing, and sending mulberry parts and juice flying. The rest of us, close by, began to get stains on our skins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a good thing we haven&rsquo;t our clothes on,&rdquo; laughed Nicky. &ldquo;My mum would be so cross if I got mulberry juice all over my dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a minute or two Shelley gave way to Laureen and each of the girls took a turn. There was much laughter and more mulberry juice going everywhere, so I said, &ldquo;If you get any more juice on you, nobody will be able to see your bikinis when you make them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wash off first,&rdquo; said Brenda, who managed to climb on the barrow for the next turn.</p>
<p>After about twenty minutes they had all had their turn, some more than once, and the barrow was awash with juice, amid of course a great deal of other squashed mulberry parts. All of us were stained with the purple juice and would have to wash before we could do any painting of bikinis.</p>
<p>While I wheeled the barrow, the girls ran for the garden tap, while Shelley ran indoors for some flannels and soap. She found four of each, so the flannels had to be shared. There were choruses of &ldquo;Please wash me, Roy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was rather worried about both the washing and the painting, as I did not want to be in trouble for touching girls around the vagina - unless invited, of course. So I said, &ldquo;Look, we&rsquo;re going to need to do this in pairs. I&rsquo;ll go with Lynn, because she&rsquo;s my girl-friend and it&rsquo;s time I gave her some attention.&rdquo; Also it wouldn&rsquo;t matter where I touched Lynn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So perhaps the rest of you can get into pairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They paired off quickly, with some moans about how lucky Lynn was.</p>
<p>Shelley went with Brenda, Nicky with Angela, and of course Laureen and Sally got together with much giggling. &ldquo;First of all we wash each other,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And then we can paint each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each pair took a flannel and got to work. Lynn and I were much cleaner than the girls and most of the juice was on our legs. Sally needed more cleaning than anybody, as she had managed to sit down in it while she was trampling the mulberries. Laureen had her lying down on her front while she rubbed away at her bottom. &ldquo;You know, Sally, you have a very wobbly bottom,&rdquo; she said as she scrubbed. &ldquo;I hope your boobs don&rsquo;t grow like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girls were getting impatient, so I said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry too much about it now; that&rsquo;s her problem really.&rdquo; So Sally got off her tummy and we prepared to paint.</p>
<p>We trundled the barrow over to the area near the pool, although I warned everybody at the start that they would not be allowed to swim and mess up the pool water until they were quite clean again afterwards. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of a bikini if you&rsquo;re not allowed to swim in it?&rdquo; asked Shelley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How often do you ever swim in a bikini?&rdquo; I asked, and she laughed.</p>
<p>Shelley had fetched a jug for each pair, and we filled our jugs at the barrow, emptying out all the solids still there. Sally immediately spilt hers down her leg and had to go and wash again. Unfortunately there were no paintbrushes, apart from a toy one of Shelley&rsquo;s that was much too small, so we had to paint with our fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best way I think is to make an outline of the bikini first,&rdquo; I suggested to them all. &ldquo;Then when you have that right, you can fill it in. Just like when you paint a picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do you first,&rdquo; I said to Lynn. So she stood there while I put some juice on my fingers and traced the outline on her body. I was well prepared to enjoy myself as I stood behind her and gently drew the outline of a bikini top around her swelling breasts. They are very clearly defined so I just ran my finger around the outside.</p>
<p>I soon realized that it is not so easy to do a good job after puberty, as Lynn&rsquo;s pubic hair prevented me from giving her a proper bikini bottom. I had to stop when my fingers reached her hair, but not before she shivered, giggled and said, &ldquo;That tickles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I kept an eye on the other girls, and every pair seemed to be having long discussions, with a lot of trial and error, over where to draw the lines. I was soon painting in Lynn&rsquo;s bikini top, smearing the mulberry juice over her breasts. They are soft but firm, and I took particular care drawing little circles round the nipples simply because I enjoyed the feel of them wobbling gently under my fingers as I painted.</p>
<p>I looked at Lynn, and we laughed into each other&rsquo;s eyes. Forgetting the others for a while, I impulsively laid Lynn down on her back, sat gently on her tummy and leaned closely over her face as I rubbed in the purple juice very gently. When I had finished, I painted in the bottoms, although again I had to stop when I reached the pubic hair.</p>
<p>Lynn insisted on as small a bikini as possible, so I did just enough to cover her groin. Then I turned her over and gently kneaded it into her firm tanned bottom and down between her legs, feeling the long hairs hanging down and her mound ever so carefully and delightfully.</p>
<p>I stood back and looked at it, but wasn&rsquo;t really satisfied. Mulberry juice is not thick enough for painting people properly with, and it didn&rsquo;t look as close to being a proper bikini as it would had we been able to use paint.</p>
<p>Lynn wanted to know what she looked like, so I went indoors and managed to unhook a large mirror and bring it outdoors. Lynn looked at herself but didn&rsquo;t seem very impressed, and I don&rsquo;t blame her. All the other girls crowded round, in various stages of being painted, to see how they looked. Most of them had not got very far yet. They seemed rather disappointed that the juice was not working very well.</p>
<p>Now it was Lynn&rsquo;s turn to paint me, just the bottom part, of course.</p>
<p>She put it on as thick as she could, also stroking it carefully into my penis and testicles as I stood there trying not to get aroused. But the results were pretty pale.</p>
<p>Lynn had finished me before the other girls had even got halfway. We went round to have a look. Sally was smearing juice all over Laureen&rsquo;s pubic area, and she was asking, &ldquo;What happens when I do a wee?&rdquo; Brenda was rubbing vigorously at Shelley, who was helping, but again the mulberry juice was not most effective. Nicky was standing elegantly with her hands on her head while Angela painted her bottom.</p>
<p>Then Sally said, &ldquo;You know, mud would be better than this. Roy, may we paint with mud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like a good idea,&rdquo; I agreed. Most of the girls agreed excitedly, although Nicky did not look happy. I think she&rsquo;s too ladylike to enjoy the idea of mud.</p>
<p>We scampered round the back to the shed, where Shelley found some empty pots. We dug up some earth from the jungle and then went to add water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a bit at a time,&rdquo; I told them. &ldquo;If you get the mud too thin, it won&rsquo;t work properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have to use mud too?&rdquo; Lynn asked me, also not liking the idea.</p>
<p>She was referring to the two of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got our costumes, even if they&rsquo;re not very clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laureen and Sally, of course, put in too much water in spite of what I said, so they had to pour some of it out and fetch some more soil. They all mixed and squeezed in the pots with their fingers and soon had some good thick smooth mud ready to use.</p>
<p>Laureen stood up quickly and started smearing mud all over her front and down between her legs, while Sally protested that this was supposed to be her job. Laureen had been too enthusiastic, and mud started dripping down her leg. She had a thick coating of mud over her skin, but it was still possible to trace the outline of her vagina through it.</p>
<p>Nicky decided to keep to the mulberries, although it was not very effective, but Shelley was another enthusiastic mud-user. When Brenda proved to be slow and hesitant in applying it, Shelley called on me to come and help. Brenda didn&rsquo;t mind, so I started off rubbing mud gently into her smooth round bottom. This brought appeals for help from the other pairs, though, so I stopped so as to avoid getting involved, and Lynn took over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The winner of the Miss Beautiful Bikini competition,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;will be the painter, not the wearer! So I can&rsquo;t go round doing it for you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the bikinis took shape and developed. Many of the girls used a mixture of mud and mulberry juice, and even tried to decorate them with leaves, although most of them quickly fell off when the mud dried. It took a long time for them to agree on the shapes and the materials, and I honestly had to admit the results were not very good. We really needed proper paint, such as is used in proper body painting, and I would have to ask Aunt Sue about that.</p>
<p>I would have preferred to wash my own costume off, but the girls protested. They may have looked at least partly as if they were wearing costumes themselves, but mine could never pass for a costume with the genitals hanging down and nowhere to tuck them, whereas a girl&rsquo;s can largely be hidden. Anyway, at least I didn&rsquo;t have to take part in the competition, and I sat as usual in my deck chair to judge.</p>
<p>It was not very inspiring this time. Sally insisted on being first, and she was rather too muddy. The mud had run in streaks down her legs and she had not been able to rub it off very well. She would certainly have been a show-off as a model, as she put on a very artificial act, turning and stretching and dancing with exaggerated elegance. As with the other mud costumes, the shape of her vagina was still clear. She had obviously been told what to do when she finished, as she minced daintily off the stage over to my deck chair, leaned on my shoulder and then rolled on to my lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuck!&rdquo; I protested, half in fun, as large areas of dried mud came in contact with my own skin. She only smiled and sat quietly on my lap, much more sensible in her behavior with me now, but quite confident of her ability to charm me with her new method. And she did succeed.</p>
<p>Next was Laureen, in thick mud but with even worse streaks down her legs. I was glad some of the others looked better than these two, but I knew now it wasn&rsquo;t easy to produce good costumes with the limited materials we had.</p>
<p>Nicky and Angela had done a fine job between them. Nicky had refused to use mud but Angela, who had painted her, had painted very carefully a little purple bikini. Her little nipples and vagina were delightfully evident, but there were also darker and lighter patterns. Angela, who followed, had also used mainly mulberries, but Nicky had painted little dots and patterns in mud, so the effect was good.</p>
<p>Shelley&rsquo;s costume had been partly painted by Lynn and myself, so she understood reluctantly that her costume, which should have been credited to her partner Brenda anyway, could not win this time. She was mainly in mud, and quite neatly done. She had been responsible for Brenda&rsquo;s costume, which really did look good - as good as can be expected using mud. It supposedly had frills at the edges, fingered in very carefully, and animal heads had been outlined by way of patterns.</p>
<p>Only one thing had been forgotten, which became clear when Brenda stretched her legs up and revealed an expanse of white and pink under her crotch, which Shelley had forgotten about.</p>
<p>Third prize I gave to Angela&rsquo;s costume, painted by Nicky, and second to Nicky&rsquo;s costume, painted by Angela. Brenda looked overjoyed to win first prize for hers, though the real winner was the painter, Shelley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to wash off now,&rdquo; said Nicky, shivering a bit because some heavy clouds had blown over the sun, and it looked like we might be in for one of those occasional midday summer downpours. The activity had not actually been a great success, although they had enjoyed it, and none of them really wanted to walk round in their painted costumes all day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t my bikini good enough?&rdquo; demanded Sally as we walked round to the taps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much mud!&rdquo; I explained to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like being muddy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You should be more muddy too.&rdquo; She wrapped her arms round my waist and tried to rub off all the mud on her on to me.</p>
<p>I reached down and slung an arm round her waist, then lifted her upside down that way. She screamed and laughed, kicking her legs wildly over my shoulders with her muddy little vagina right under my nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like being muddy, you can have some more,&rdquo; I laughed, carrying her over to the barrow. I dumped her in the barrow and rolled her in the mulberry juice that was still there, while she laughed and screamed and kicked. &ldquo;Quick, girls, bring the rest of that mud!&rdquo; I called.</p>
<p>Giggling, they ran off and came back with the pots still with plenty of mud inside.</p>
<p>We poured the mud over the thrashing body of Sally, who was by now almost helpless with laughter. Then I rubbed it in, all over her chest and her body, her bottom, her legs, even down between her legs. There was plenty of it and we all loved it.</p>
<p>At last we stood back and looked at out handiwork. Sally was covered with sticky brown mud from her shoulders downwards. As she kicked, the barrow tipped over. She landed in a muddy heap on the grass, and the remaining mud in the barrow sloshed out on top of her. She was a hilarious sight, and she was laughing almost until she cried. Then she got up and chased us, wrapping her arms round us and giving us as much of the mud as she could when she caught us.</p>
<p>Finally, when the fun had worn off, it was time to get clean. &ldquo;Right, in pairs again,&rdquo; I said, as we filled some buckets with water from the tap and got the flannels and soap again. There was much giggling and squealing as the costumes came off. I soaped and flannelled Lynn over gently, rubbing the mulberry juice carefully off her breasts and loins, and then she did the same with my now very faded costume.</p>
<p>We were all just finishing the job when some big drops of rain began to fall. They quickly became heavier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go inside?&rdquo; Nicky asked me, just finishing the job of wiping off Angela&rsquo;s cute bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re too wet, I think,&rdquo; I laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to play in the rain!&rdquo; shouted Shelley. Dropping the flannel and soap, she spread out her arms and scooted off at top speed, racing through the heavy rain, screaming with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch her!&rdquo; shouted Laureen, and she and Sally went racing after her.</p>
<p>The others soon followed, and I ran with them, enjoying the cold teeming rain pouring down on to my body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch Roy!&rdquo; screamed Shelley, turning and running towards me. I ran towards her rather than away, and she hurtled into my arms, wet and slippery as an eel. We both tumbled on the ground, laughing, and the other girls piled on top of us. Slippery wet bottoms tumbled on top of me as I struggled to sit up. Laureen was sitting on my chest, soaking wet vagina open inches from my nose. Sally pulled her backwards, and her legs shot upwards and then rolled off.</p>
<p>It was a glorious rough-and-tumble, and even Lynn joined in, although this is not normally her type of activity. Her pubic hair was glistening as water ran down it, making it look almost like a little beard. I grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her round, but my hands slid off her soaking wet breasts. Nicky, laughing, sprawled across my chest, and I could feel her little wet nipples. I reached out both hands to grab the nearest body to me, and a slippery wet Brenda slid into my arms and out again before I caught her more tightly. But her soaking little body again slipped out of the bottom of my grasp.</p>
<p>Scrambling to our feet, we chased each other round again. Sally slipped and fell over backwards, making an exhibition of herself as usual as she swung her open legs in the air, howling with laughter. Nicky looked a beautiful sight as she stood still in the rain, legs together so that her little vagina looked no more than an extension of the groove between them, head back, eyes closed, arms stretched upwards as she tried to catch the rain. Then Angela pointed to the tree near the verandah. There were our clothes, out in the rain and soaking wet!</p>
<p>There was nothing we could do about them, so we continued to enjoy the rain. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, it stopped. Clouds remained over the sun and a wind sprang up. Suddenly we felt chilly. I glanced downwards and saw my penis, small and tight in the cold rain, and my testicles, clinging up closer to my body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we need a hot shower,&rdquo; I grinned at the others. We could get that easily enough inside the house, but we were all soaking wet. Sally made a great display of her chattering teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Shelley. &ldquo;Roy, you dry yourself and go inside. Then you can carry us all to the shower!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My little cousin has some weird ideas, but I liked this one. The only problem was what to dry myself on, as it was all so wet outside. In the end I ran round the back, put my arm through the window, pulled a kitchen towel off the hook and ran back again with it.</p>
<p>I sat down on the front doorstep but was not allowed to dry myself. The girls seized the towel between them and tried in a very disorganized way to dry me. I insisted that my feet and legs were the most important part as they would be in contact with the polished floor and carpet, and eventually, swamped by chattering girls who rubbed my legs up and down, I felt I was reasonably dry.</p>
<p>Still a little damp, I entered the house and walked down the passage to the bathroom near the end. I turned on the heater and the shower, and then came back for the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going by numbers again,&rdquo; Shelley told me. &ldquo;Choose a number between one and seven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My first choice turned out to be Brenda. I lowered my head while she, smiling, reached up with her arms and clasped me round my neck. Then I gently lifted her in my arms and carried her down to the bathroom. She felt as light as a feather, and I loved her thin little face as she looked up so trustingly at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem nervous of me any more!&rdquo; I smiled at her as I put her gently down on the side of the bath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know you&rsquo;re kind,&rdquo; she whispered shyly. &ldquo;I wish you were my big brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish you were my little sister,&rdquo; I replied, smiling, as I returned for the next load. She slipped into the shower, where the water was now beautiful and warm.</p>
<p>My next choice turned out to be Angela. She lay peacefully back in my arms, her own arms folded across her tummy and her little bare body glistening with drops of water and goose flesh. She felt cold as I hugged her to my chest, but then I probably did to her as well. The only trace of color I could see on her was in her cheeks, pink as they so often were.</p>
<p>I wondered if she blushed several hundred times every day, or whether it was just with me. Shelley later told me that it was mainly with me.</p>
<p>Angela always pretended she did not like boys, according to Shelley, but she was certainly quite hopeless at pretending with me. I pressed my cheek against her forehead as I carried her down the passage and whispered, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very special girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynn won the next round. I was quite used to carrying her, so the younger girls had felt lighter to me. She traveled with her arms round my neck, with her left breast pressing against my chest.</p>
<p>Sally, the next, had to be different. She wanted to be carried like a koala, sitting on my hips with her legs spread out each side of me, head against my throat and arms round my back. As I carried her, she released her arms and flopped backwards, head down and vagina wide open at my stomach level. With her head down and untidy hair hanging almost to floor level, I had to waddle along carefully until I dumped her on the toilet seat, much to her amusement.</p>
<p>Back I went for Laureen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather heavy,&rdquo; she warned me as I picked her up side-saddle, her bottom resting on my hip. It was a rather awkward way to carry her anyway, and I caused much mirth as I staggered along, pretending to be ready to collapse under such a heavy load.</p>
<p>An impatient Shelley was next, leaping up and wrapping her arms round my shoulders, head and cold wet hair pressed against my neck. I held her just under her bottom as I carried her down to the bathroom, which was now getting rather crowded. The shower was, anyway, as all the girls I had carried in were squashing into it together, amid much squealing and laughter.</p>
<p>Finally I went back to Nicky, who was shivering. Her little body felt so cold as I picked her up tenderly and held her in my arms like a baby. She snuggled up against me for warmth, and I smiled down at her, admiring the curves in her body. Her fair hair was still curly despite being wet and her little round face showed beautiful dimples as she smiled up at me despite her cold. Her neck curved beautifully down to her little round chest, and her sides curved in again and then out at the hips, all the way down between her legs, where I could just make out the top of her vagina lips curving delicately inwards.</p>
<p>I kicked the front door shut and carried my little beauty into the bathroom, to find the shower bursting with girls. &ldquo;Gangway!&rdquo; I ordered, trying to push my way in, still carrying Nicky. I couldn&rsquo;t, but willing if not so strong hands reached out to pull her inside. I could feel the warm steam flowing out of the shower and a few splashes of water. The noise was indescribable as seven naked girls squealed, sang and chattered away loudly as they warmed up. I sat on the side of the bath and waited for them, shivering.</p>
<p>After about five minutes I heard Lynn&rsquo;s voice saying, &ldquo;Girls, what about poor Roy? He must be cold! We must get out and let him have a shower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They wanted to stay in, I could tell, but kindness won over and they began to emerge from the cubicle, grabbing for towels. Still shivering, I went in. It was such a relief to feel the warm water pouring down over my body.</p>
<p>Shelley put her head inside the shower. &ldquo;May I come back in with you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Without thinking I said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and so opened the floodgates. Shelley leapt through the door into my arms. A moment later Sally&rsquo;s face pushed its way inside, quickly followed by the rest of her body, and a horde of other bodies followed. Within seconds I was pressed against the back wall, with my penis squashed against Shelley&rsquo;s tummy and scarcely able to move. The girls were all reaching out their arms towards me, wanting a hug and a cuddle. Lynn I saw at the back, smiling but unable to get in.</p>
<p>The little bodies felt warm and fresh now, and I quickly began to warm up. The spray sprinkled warm water over us all, and whenever I reached out I seemed to get a tangle of wet hair, which was tumbling down over their eyes and faces. Sally grabbed an arm and slobbered kisses over it. Nicky, arm at full length, was stroking my chest over Sally&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>It all felt so good, so wonderfully good.</p>
<p>In the end we all tired of it. We squeezed our way out of the shower, and of course the girls all wanted me to dry them. Taking Angela first, I wrapped a towel gently around her, knelt down next to her and rubbed.</p>
<p>She never took her blue eyes from me as I massaged her body, from head to toe and between her legs, ever so gently. I would never break the trust of these delightful little girls by abusing them sexually, although I do allow myself loving touching in private areas when I know they want me to. Carefully I lifted the towel to dry her hair and our bare bodies pressed together, her stomach pressed against my chest with her damp vagina just below as I rubbed.</p>
<p>When I finished, I decided it was Lynn&rsquo;s turn, as she had not been able to join us in the shower. She leaned back against me, eyes closed with a smile playing over her lips, as I dried her hair, then gently massaged her firm breasts. Working my way down, I tenderly dried her pubic hair and between her legs, and heard Laureen whisper, &ldquo;Just like a husband and wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one I dried them - Shelley, my excitable and loveable little cousin with her warm nature and warm body; the beautiful soft curvy Nicky; thin, delicate little Brenda; the saucy, wriggly and sometimes delightful Laureen; and the partially reformed Sally. It was a pleasure that I never wanted to end.</p>
<p>But it had to come to an end, and we had a problem. It would soon be time to go home and all our clothes were wet. Most of Shelley&rsquo;s had just gone into the wash, so she had little to lend and I told her in any case I would not be seen dead in one of her mini-skirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll just have to put on our wet underwear,&rdquo; I told them all, &ldquo;and explain that we got caught outside when the rain began. We needn&rsquo;t mention that we were naked then anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the clouds had cleared away and the sun was shining down hotly again, raising steam from the driveway, the roof and the garden. I slipped with regret into my underpants. The girls sat on the front doorstep or on the ground next to it, putting on their panties. My loins warmed as I watched them lift their legs, saw the soft white lips of their little hairless vaginas from top to bottom, and grateful that I was counted as trustworthy of seeing what I did.</p>
<p>Then we sat around on the grass in the shade waiting for the cars to arrive. Lynn was next to me, leaning on my shoulder with her head back and resting against my cheek. The girls were chatting, often several at once to me, and in front of me Laureen and Sally were talking and giggling together. Laureen idly reached inside her brief panties to scratch gently, giving me a glimpse of her lovely pink and white vagina as she did so. This was where it all started for me on Saturday, I remembered, when this pert, saucy girl had lost the pink panties she had been wearing then.</p>
<p>Laureen glanced across at me and grinned, still scratching and quite careless of the fact that I could see her budding womanhood. My loins warmed again with the pleasure. &ldquo;This is the life,&rdquo; I thought. I said aloud, &ldquo;What a lucky man I am. Here I am, sitting in the sun with my lovely wife and all my beautiful daughters.&rdquo; I waited for the giggles to subside. &ldquo;This is the life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The End</p>
