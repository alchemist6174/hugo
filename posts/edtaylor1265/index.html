  "articleBody": "I was always getting into trouble. I was always the tallest kid in my grade, so when something went wrong, I always got noticed and blamed. When I hit puberty, I shot up to nearly six feet almost overnight. Teachers always expected me to act my age, when they really meant act my height. Growing up is tough for everyone I guess, but my big sister Robyn made it a pleasure, literally.\nEven though Robyn is older than I am, we have always been close. There were some rough times when she was “becoming a woman” around 12 or 13, but by the time I was beginning to “become a man,” Robyn showed me the ropes, among other things.\nRobyn had a way of getting me to talk about whatever was troubling me. Even when I felt embarrassed, she would throw her arm around me and after beating around the bush, I would finally tell her the problem. What made it impossible for me to hide anything from her was that she was always so open with me. She would tell me everything that was going on her.\nShe also seemed to have absolutely no modesty around me. I was in her room once talking about some of the things happening around school when she began changing her clothes. I was certainly aware this was just my sister but I was also aware that most of my friends would have given anything to witness the show I got during the next few minutes. Keeping up her side of the conversation, she proceeded to strip down to her bra and panties. I had seen her this way many times, so I wasn’t particularly shocked. This time she continued to undress, slipping off her bra and tossing it on the bed.\n“So tell me, little brother, do you think I have a chance to catch a boy with these boobs?” The little brother was a bit of a joke between us, in the last year, I’d grown taller than her. Although she was three years ahead of me in school, she was only two years, two months and two days older than me. She started first grade early and was a year behind the other girls in her grade. Between elementary and junior high school, all of the other girls “grew up,” but she didn’t. She was always nervous about her breast size, even now.\nI mean, what could I say? Bigger than oranges, there were these two gorgeous tits in front of my eyes. I felt my dick getting hard. “Uh, Sis,” I murmured, “they’re great, but I’m your brother.”\n“Huh? It’s not like you haven’t seen me naked. What, are you getting a hard-on? Do I make you horny? Maybe, there’s a chance for me, after all. Hey, it’s been a while since we played show and tell. I’ll show you mine if you’ll show me yours. How about it?”\nWithout really waiting for me to reply, Robyn slipped her panties off. With her hands on her hips she looked at me, full on letting me see everything she had. I really couldn’t tell what I should look at. Breasts were at that time in my life the most exciting “forbidden fruit” but that patch of curly hair at the base of her tummy fascinated me, too. I was just beginning to get some growth of hair down there but it looked like nothing compared to hers. The last time I had seen her crotch it was sparsely covered as mine.\n“Come on, Edward,” she coaxed. “Get naked. I’m feeling horny and nasty and you know what happened the last time I felt that way.” I remembered with a smile. It was several years ago, but I still could clearly remember giving each other back rubs and then rubbing lotion all over each other. Robyn made me rub her pussy over and over until she was shaking. She even rubbed my cock until it started feeling really weird and I made her stop. It had been quite an experience.\nRobyn began rubbing her tits with one hand and her furry mound with the other. I decided there was really no way out so I proceeded to undress trying to hide my very erect cock but she insisted that I let her see everything.\n“Why, Edward, you’ve grown so nicely! Why have you been hiding this from me you naughty little boy?” She had one hand on my cock and the other around my balls so I didn’t dare even move. I always wanted a girl to do this, but Robyn was my sister! She started to rub her hand up and down my cock. “I bet you do this a lot,” she suggested. “I bet you jerk off every night.”\nNot having any idea what she was talking about, I thought maybe she was trying to call me a jerk or something. I guess she must have seen my expression because she then said, “You do know how to beat your meat, don’t you?”\n“What?”\n“Beat your meat. Pound your pud. Masturbate, kid.”\nI just shrug. I’ve played with my dick, but not that much.\n“You’re kidding, right?” I shake my head. “Wow,” she continued, “I’ve been doing it for years. Here, let me show you.”\nThis was so embarrassing. I hate not knowing something. Here I was stark naked in front of my own sister with her hand on my boner that wouldn’t quit. Still, it felt pretty good as she stroked her hand up and down it.\n“Now,” she said, “grab your cock about halfway down. Hold it tight enough that you can move the loose skin around your dick back and forth while feeling the hard muscle underneath. Try it now. That’s it. Start slowly. Pull the skin forward until your fingers almost slide off the tip of your cock. Now pull it back until its tight. That’s it. Back and forth. Back and forth.”\nIt felt great. I couldn’t figure out why I hadn’t learned about this before. Pretty soon I felt the pressure build up like I needed to pee and the more I held back the more the pressure built up. I couldn’t help it. I couldn’t relax those muscles.\n“Okay, Edward! Your balls are getting tighter. You’re about ready to shoot your load. Hold back as long as you can but keep pumping. Now is when you get the best feelings. Put your other hand underneath your balls and play with them. Doesn’t that feel good? Keep it up. Faster now. Faster.”\nI was getting this strange feeling in my gut that I had never felt before. If I tried to relax, it felt like I was going to pee. When I tried t o tighten up so that wouldn’t happen it felt like I had built a dam and pressure was rapidly building up behind it. The pressure was now so high that I couldn’t relax and yet it seemed like any minute now, the dam would burst. I felt a little panic along with all the wonderful feelings building inside me. It reminded me of our back rub years ago.\nSuddenly, I exploded. My cock began jerking uncontrollably and a clear whitish fluid began squirting out with each jerk. I could no more stop the spurts than I could stop a sneeze. It was a wonderful feeling but so strange. I don’t remember much for the next couple of minutes except that the feeling was wonderful. I splattered it all over the mirror as it came out in great big gobs. I got some on my hand as I was still pumping my cock and the lubrication gave me an even more sensational feeling. I was hooked.\nEvery day after school and all night that week, I played with myself. My cock was getting so sore I could barely walk. I started borrowing Robyn’s skin cream and that made it even better when I stroked it long and hard.\n",
