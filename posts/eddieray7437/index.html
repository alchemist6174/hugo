  "articleBody": "Jim Johnson was a very young man. He was just twenty nine when his entire world came crashing down on him. He was just laid off for the third time this year from a temporary job, three months after his wife of nine years left him and just two days before Christmas. To make matters worse he kept having flashbacks to the same painful event five years ago. The day his sweet little four year old daughter Angela was taken from outside her preschool because he was late picking her up. He hated himself; his wife could no longer handle his depression and heavy drinking, so she left him also. Now Jim had no one to spend his nights with and to make matters worse the snow was falling harder as he was going home after buying a bottle of booze. He was cussing himself for that horrible day five years ago.\nAs he was heading home he felt a little hand touching his. He turned around and there was a girl of eight or nine reaching for his hand. She was soaking wet from the snow and shivering. Her gloves and shoes had holes in them. She had long blonde hair, the prettiest green eyes he had ever seen and pouty lips. He asked her what she wanted.\n“Can I go home with you please? My father has been arrested and they tried to take me to a foster home, I ran away.”\n“I don’t think it is a good idea me taking you home. I am not a very nice person.”\n“I think you are, so please I don’t want to spend the night on the streets this close to Christmas.”\nJim relented and told her to come on. She grabbed his big hand and held it as they were walking to his apartment. She smiled up at him as they walked but they did not talk while walking. Finally five minutes later they arrived at Jim’s rundown apartment. Jim turned the heat up a little so the little one could get warm. He suggested to the girl that she take a bath to warm herself. He went to the bathroom and turned on the water filling the tub. He returned to his room and grabbed a clean towel, a tooth brush and one of his big shirts for her to wear. He placed the items in the bathroom for her to use. Then he made up the couch for him to sleep on that night.\nJim went to his kitchen to find something for them to eat that night, he found two boxes of Hamburger Helper, and he pulled out the package of hamburger and prepared their meal. As Jim was putting the meal on the table she came out dressed in his big shirt and sat down. He rolled the sleeves of the shirt up so she could eat, then he took her wet clothes and put them in the washer. He returned and sat down to eat with his guest. Jim was now trying to figure what to do with his guest as he had prepared the last bit of food for them and he did not have a job. Jim decided to worry about that until tomorrow. After eating dinner Jim cleared the dishes while his guest watched television.\nShe asked him who the couch was made up for.\n“I am sleeping on the couch, you can have my bed tonight,” Jim said.\nI can’t take your bed from you,\" the little girl said.\n“I am not going to debate this with you little one, I am sleeping here and you in my room,” Jim said sternly.\n“Ok,” said the little girl.\nThey continued watching television for another hour and they both decided to call it the night. Jim put on a pair of shorts and climbed under the covers on the couch and tried to go to sleep. After sleeping for about an hour he felt the little girls hand on his shoulder. Jim rolled over towards her and said “what is it little one?”\n“I’ve had a bad dream. I am scared and I can’t get back to sleep will you please sleep with me?” the little girl said.\n“No because it is not right,” Jim said.\n“Just until I get back to sleep.” The little girl replied.\nReluctantly Jim agreed and the little girl led him by the hand to his bedroom. He climbed in bed with the girl and held her tight. She felt good in his arms.\n“How old are you?” Jim asked.\n“Nine,” the little girl responded.\nThe little girl turned and faced Jim, and then she kissed him on the lips.\n“What are you doing?” asked Jim.\n“I was kissing you good night, and besides I want to thank you for keeping me warm tonight,” the little girl said.\nThe little girl got out of bed and removed her shirt and was wearing nothing. She asked Jim to get naked with her.\n“I can’t do what you want little one,” Jim said “I can go to jail for this.\n“Well I am not going to tell anyone,” she said.\nJim and his bed partner returned to kissing, reluctantly Jim lost his shorts and underwear. They both were naked. Jim took the covers off of them and laid the little girl on her back. He started to fondle her breast with one hand and suck on the other one. The little girl let out a soft moan as he did this. Then his hand started to move lower on her body and he found her hairless pussy. He started rubbing it and her little clit. She started to moan as he did this. She was getting very wet down there and Jim’s nine inch cock was leaking copious amounts of pre cum.\nJim started to kiss his way down the little girl’s body until he reached her groin area. He licked her thighs; then he placed his mouth over the little girl’s pussy. She let out a shriek as he started to lick her pussy. He licked her from her ass hole to her clit. He was grasping a hand full of sheet with both hands and thrashing her head about as Jim ate her pussy. She grabbed Jim by both sides of the head and held him against her pussy.\nSuddenly she screamed out as she had a massive orgasm and flooded Jim’s mouth and sheets with her nectar. Jim climbed up on top of her, he did not have to worry about lubrication as he was leaking a lot of pre cum and the size of her orgasm had her well lubed. Jim started pushing his cock into the little girl. His head went in and he encountered her maiden hood. Jim pulled out slightly and then lunged into the little girl ripping through her hymen shredding her virginity from her.\nShe screamed out at having her virginity ripped to shreds. Jim laid still in her until he felt her body relax, then he started with long deep strokes. The little girl was receiving pleasure that she had never experience in her young life. After twenty minutes of Jim fucking this little beauty, she had her second ever orgasm, her first while being fucked. This was too much for Jim as her pussy was milking his cock he flooded her pussy with a large helping of hot fertile sperm. After his fifth shot of sperm Jim almost blacked out so he concentrated on breathing.\nThey both laid there in post orgasmic bliss. Jim looked at the little girl and said, “I love you.”\nJim then asked the little girl, “What is your name?”\n“My father called me Lori when he kidnapped me five years ago. But my name is really Angela Johnson,” the little girl said.\n“What is your name?” Angela asked.\n“Jim Johnson,” a stunned Jim responded.\nThey both looked at each other and cried as they realized that father and daughter just had sex with one another. Then they both cried tears of joy as they realized they had been reunited. Jim was begging for forgiveness for being late that day. Angela told him she forgave him. They made love again. The next day they went to police station and told the police what happened. The police charged the guy with kidnapping. Jim found a job that he could support both of them and enrolled his daughter in school. Jim never had those nightmares again.\nOne month later Angela found out how grown up she had become as morning sickness kicked in. Jim and her doctor diagnosed her as very pregnant.\n",
