I had always pulled out with Jessica, my 13-year old stepsister, but when my 11-year old sister joined in, she wouldn’t let me pull out the first time. Our story continues from there.\nAs we all rested from our mutual orgasms, I managed to ask,\n“Where did you learn to lick pussy Mary?”\n“Remember when I went to Campfire Girls in Second Grade?” she asked.\n“Yes. Did you have a fun experience there?”\n“I did. One of the older girls showed us how we can feel so much pleasure down there.”\nI wanted to hear more, and was already half-hard after the few details I had heard.\n“So what about you Jessica? Why did you go down on Mary?” I asked.\n“I was just following her example.”\nThe next day, we decided to let Sabrina and my brother Ray join in. We all got ready for a swim in the pool, and Jessica suggested that we shed our suits and skinny dip. Me and Mary quickly agreed. My brother seemed ok, and when Sabrina agreed, we all stripped. I’d already seen Jessica and Mary naked. My brother was no surprise, being an identical twin; it was like looking in a mirror.\nSabrina was the new sight. My brother checked out all the girls, I looked at Sabrina. Even at only ten years old, she was quite a sight. Great skin tone, slightly tanned, with paler skin showing where her swimsuit had covered it. No real tits yet, but tiny swellings of the nipples showing promise of the future. A flat stomach and a beautiful hairless pussy.\nMe and my brother were hard in just a few seconds. We all looked each other over for a few moments, and then climbed into the pool. The cool water shrunk us boys a bit, but the sight of the girls, especially with their nipples getting hard, compensated.\nWe played in the water for a little while. Us boys rubbed up against the girls as often as possible. When we all got tired of the water and climbed out, we noticed a few strings of white fluid floating in the pool. I guess Ray got a little too excited. I hadn’t cum yet, but I guess the girls naked wasn’t as new an experience to me.\nAfter we picked up our clothes, and dried ourselves off, we all walked back into the house still naked. As the girls walked ahead of us, I watched their cute asses, and saw with my peripheral vision that my brother was regaining his hard-on. A quick turn of my head confirmed it. Good, I was hoping he could help me take care of the girls.\nWe all headed to Jessica’s room, after dunking our swimwear and dropping it in the hamper with the wet towels. If the folks got home and found a hamper full of wet towels, and no wet swimwear, they might ask a few questions.\nWhen we got there, Jessica brought Ray and Sabrina up to speed on what we had already done together, and with Mary. Me and Jessica started out to show them how us boys could pull out, and try to avoid pregnancy. As Jessica was reaching climax, she locked her legs around me just like Mary did yesterday.\n“What are you doing, Jessica? I have to pull out soon.” I said.\n“Mary got to feel it, I want to as well,” she said as I couldn’t hold back any longer. We came together, enjoying each other’s bodies as well as the audience. As we pulled apart, my brother was mounting my sister. It was like watching a repeat of yesterday, seeing an identical body on top of the same sister I fucked yesterday. And she locked her legs around him just like she did to me.\nWatching my twin fuck our sister got me hard enough for another go. Sabrina wanted to have some fun, and when my brother rolled off of our sister, Jessica started cleaning Mary’s pussy, while Sabrina took her first taste of cock and cleaned my brother up. That of course got him hard again.\nWe had to search the room for a coin to flip, to see who would be the one to pop Sabrina’s cherry. I won two out of three, so I approached Sabrina, while Ray went to Jessica. I licked Sabrina’s pussy while my brother licked Jessica’s, getting a taste of my semen that was still in there.\n“Does it always taste like that?” he asked as he pulled back.\n“No, it’s normally a lot better, but you got some leftover jizz in there. Sorry bro. Here try Sabrina for a bit,” I said as I moved over. The bed was just large enough for one person, and now we had five on it. There was a fair amount of naked skin sliding against naked skin as I moved over to Mary, pausing briefly to kiss Jessica, and give her boobs a quick squeeze. I kissed Mary, squeezed her boobs a bit, and leaned up to remind my brother that I won the coin toss and I get Sabrina first.\n“You’re right, that does taste better,” he said as he got up from Sabrina. I moved back to Sabrina, while he moved back to Jessica. Again, lots of skin contact between all of us as we moved. I got in position on Sabrina, at the same time that Ray got on Jessica. We entered our step-sisters almost simultaneously, and both girls quickly locked their legs around us. Sabrina let out a little gasp when I popped her cherry, but we were soon fucking at an even rhythm. Odd how in sync twins can get, we were on either side of the bed, on top of a stepsister. Between us was our biological sister, helping with some nipple tweaks to the other girls, and tickling the balls of her brothers.\nMe and my brother somehow managed to come inside both girls at the same time. We rolled off the girls so that we were all squeezed together, us boys between the girls, our sister in the middle.\nTo be continued…\n",
