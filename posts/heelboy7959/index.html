You can’t get loose. You know, when I took that sailing course last summer… Sailing was fun, but the knots really came in handy now. I’ve learned a lot. But that’s another story.\nSorry I had to tie you up, please don’t get mad at me. You will like it. At least I hope so.\nYou are still drowsy, aren’t you. Sorry, that’s the sleeping pills. It will wear off soon. It was the easiest way I could figure out…\nI guess, you will wonder, why I’m doing all this. I can’t understand your moaning and mumbling, so I will have to do all the talking … Sorry about the gag. I know that no one will hear you here - mommy and Tracy are away for the weekend - but I wouldn’t want you to talk all the time. I don’t want to hear you yell at me, you know. I’m sick of being a little girl and being told what to do all the time.\nAnyway, I …, I can hear you. I mean, you and Tracy. I know that you are doing things to my sister. She has never told me anything, but sometimes at night I can hear you in her room. I know that’s supposed to be not right and sometimes she even cries, but… I’ve been wondering, why don’t you ever come to me? What’s so fucking special about Tracy? I know she’s pretty, and she always puts on a lot of makeup, tries to look older. If you ask me, I think it’s slutty… Anyway, look at my breasts, they have really grown lately. Do you like them, daddy? Nice and firm with big hard nipples. I am not a little girl anymore. I’m sick of hearing ‘You are too young’ all the time. ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that. Be patient, you are too young.’ I can’t stand it anymore.\nNow you see what I can do.\nSee?! I knew you’d get mad at me. Now it’s really good that you can’t talk. I hope you don’t mind chewing on mom’s panties. Don’t try to push them out, that’s really a lot of tape around your head. Just cool down and breathe through your nose. There’s nothing you can do.\nAnyway, you and Tracy… Don’t worry, I won’t tell mom. It’s just that… why don’t you ever come to me? Don’t you find me attractive, too? Don’t you want to touch me? Feel my soft skin. I could put on makeup for you, dress up like a big girl, if you like that. Oooh, that makes my slit tingle all over… I don’t know why.\nLook, dad, I found these in mom’s drawer. Not in her closet with her other shoes. I guess they were kind of hidden there. I’ve never seen mom wear them. Does she put them on when you do it? Here in your bedroom? Do you like them? I mean, does it make you … like, hard?\nThey look nice, very sexy with those long, thin heels. Maybe I should put them on. Would you like me to wear these shoes for you? But then again: Why am I asking? I can just do it and you can’t keep me from anything. This time I’m in control. Very convenient that mom and I have the same shoe size; she has really small feet. Wow, they are tight, my toes are all cramped. And those heels are so high, I can hardly stand up. How does mom walk in these shoes? Or does she walk at all? Whew, I’m so tall now. Look, dad! They make my legs look so long. Do you like that, daddy?\nSee me strutting like … Oops, I better sit down on the bed.\nUh-oh, look at your … uhm, prick. You do like these heels, don’t you?! Do you like the way it makes my legs look longer? The way I walk in those sexy high pumps? You know, I’ve always wanted to wear heels, like a big girl, but mom never lets me.\nWow, it’s really huge. I’ve always been wondering how it looks when it’s, you know, like this. Can I touch it? Hmmm, you can’t prevent me anyway. Don’t squirm so much, daddy. I won’t hurt you. Just let me … It’s really big, dad. I can hardly get my fingers around it. Hmmm…, I wonder what it feels like in my … Is that how you like it, when I stroke it like this, up and down? It’s so warm and hard. I think I like your cock, daddy. It’s also a good sign for me whether you like things or not, right?\nWhat happens when I keep doing this? Will you, like, shoot that white gooey stuff? I would love to see that.\nPlease, daddy, come on! Don’t fight it. Don’t look at me that way. You can’t do anything. I thought you’d like it when I do that. For what I’ve heard all men like it. Well, at least I think your cock likes it, it’s really throbbing. That’s so cool! Now let me try something else, now that you are really helpless. I know I’m not supposed to do that, but … Just a little bit, I won’t put it in all the way. I looks too big anyway.\nNow let me see: When I spread my legs and sit over your chest … A little bit lower …\nCome on, daddy, hold still, don’t buck so much, or else I have to tie you even tighter.\nDaddy! I’ll pinch your nipples! That’s better. Just relax and enjoy. Now, which way am I supposed to do this? Facing your feet, so that you can see my shoes? .. I mean: mom’s. Would you like to touch them? Hmmmm.\nSorry, I can’t untie you now.\nOr the other way round, so I can look into your face. Yes, I’d love to see the look in your eyes … So helpless. I think I like that, daddy. Seeing you spread out on the bed, you still have a nice body for your age. And that cute helpless look on your face with your stuffed mouth. Makes my slit tingle the same way it feels sometimes when I think of … things, you know.\nOkay, is it really supposed to go inside? I looks so huge. Mmmmhh, this feels good. Ouch, it’s really big. Am I too small for this? There is something …, your cock is stuck.\nSo I’ll just move up and down a little bit. Mhhhh, I like that.\nBut, uhh, I should really better stop now before you …., you know. Not in me anyway. I heard that is not supposed to be healthy. Okay, here we go. Hmmmm, too bad, that was feeling real good. Yes, I know you are disappointed now but I can’t let you do this, you understand.\nActually, I shouldn’t be telling you this but … A couple weeks ago I found a web site on our computer that was all about high heels as well. Funny, isn’t it? Or maybe you watched it a few days before. Anyway, I was curious and started looking at all these … dunno, practices. Like licking shoes, trampling, and there were actually some women kind of jerking guys with their shoes.\nIs that what you like, daddy? Too bad you can’t really answer me, and probably it would be too embarrassing, so I can only guess. Do you like to lick high heels? Would you like to run your tongue all over the smooth leather and suck on the stiletto heel? Doesn’t work right now with you all gagged. I’d love to see you take the long heel all the way into you mouth,\nhmmm, maybe next time. Or do you like the smell? The leather, my sweaty feet, whatever? Would you like to sniff them … yuck, no.\nOr is it trampling? The stiletto heels all over your skin. But I couldn’t hurt you, dad, don’t worry.\nSo maybe you like to feel the shoes on your dick? That is something we can do here.\nBut maybe there is something. Since you like those shoes so much … I have once seen this on the internet. It’s called shoejob, I guess. See, if I touch you with those heels, the soles … rubbing them up and down your shaft. It’s still hard. Do you like that, daddy?\nYou are beginning to like it! I can tell from the way you move. Don’t be embarrassed. Just relax and let go. Feel the smooth leather on your dick, the way I rub it up an down. Nice and slow. Hmmm…, your dick seems to enjoy it, it’s pulsing. Yes, daddy, now you are sounding a lot better. Those moans are good, right? This time you really like it.\nCome on, yes … This is actually fun. I like the way you are writhing in the rope, how you thrust your hips. I wonder if this is going to make you … uhhh, cum. Squirt your goo, whatever. I’d love to see that, daddy. Yes, cum all over my feet, over mom’s high heels, make them wet, she won’t notice, if you clean them up afterwards. It’s going to be our little secret. Okay?\nYes, daddy, enjoy the stilettos rubbing your dick, up and down, faster and faster, feel the hard leather sole on the shaft, the sexy heel rubbing you - cum for me, show me, give it to me, cum all over those heels - mmmmhhhh, yes, here we go, daddy - wow, that is quite a load. Yuck! I’m all wet … that was … awesome.\n…\nYou know what? I’ll do the cleaning. I don’t want to untie you yet.\n",

<p>Or the other way round, so I can look into your face. Yes, I&rsquo;d love to see the look in your eyes &hellip; So helpless. I think I like that, daddy. Seeing you spread out on the bed, you still have a nice body for your age. And that cute helpless look on your face with your stuffed mouth. Makes my slit tingle the same way it feels sometimes when I think of &hellip; things, you know.</p>
<p>Okay, is it really supposed to go inside? I looks so huge. Mmmmhh, this feels good. Ouch, it&rsquo;s really big. Am I too small for this? There is something &hellip;, your cock is stuck.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just move up and down a little bit. Mhhhh, I like that.</p>
<p>But, uhh, I should really better stop now before you &hellip;., you know. Not in me anyway. I heard that is not supposed to be healthy. Okay, here we go. Hmmmm, too bad, that was feeling real good. Yes, I know you are disappointed now but I can&rsquo;t let you do this, you understand.</p>
<p>Actually, I shouldn&rsquo;t be telling you this but &hellip; A couple weeks ago I found a web site on our computer that was all about high heels as well. Funny, isn&rsquo;t it? Or maybe you watched it a few days before. Anyway, I was curious and started looking at all these &hellip; dunno, practices. Like licking shoes, trampling, and there were actually some women kind of jerking guys with their shoes.</p>
<p>Is that what you like, daddy? Too bad you can&rsquo;t really answer me, and probably it would be too embarrassing, so I can only guess. Do you like to lick high heels? Would you like to run your tongue all over the smooth leather and suck on the stiletto heel? Doesn&rsquo;t work right now with you all gagged. I&rsquo;d love to see you take the long heel all the way into you mouth,</p>
<p>hmmm, maybe next time. Or do you like the smell? The leather, my sweaty feet, whatever? Would you like to sniff them &hellip; yuck, no.</p>
<p>Or is it trampling? The stiletto heels all over your skin. But I couldn&rsquo;t hurt you, dad, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>So maybe you like to feel the shoes on your dick? That is something we can do here.</p>
<p>But maybe there is something. Since you like those shoes so much &hellip; I have once seen this on the internet. It&rsquo;s called shoejob, I guess. See, if I touch you with those heels, the soles &hellip; rubbing them up and down your shaft. It&rsquo;s still hard. Do you like that, daddy?</p>
<p>You are beginning to like it! I can tell from the way you move. Don&rsquo;t be embarrassed. Just relax and let go. Feel the smooth leather on your dick, the way I rub it up an down. Nice and slow. Hmmm&hellip;, your dick seems to enjoy it, it&rsquo;s pulsing. Yes, daddy, now you are sounding a lot better. Those moans are good, right? This time you really like it.</p>
<p>Come on, yes &hellip; This is actually fun. I like the way you are writhing in the rope, how you thrust your hips. I wonder if this is going to make you &hellip; uhhh, cum. Squirt your goo, whatever. I&rsquo;d love to see that, daddy. Yes, cum all over my feet, over mom&rsquo;s high heels, make them wet, she won&rsquo;t notice, if you clean them up afterwards. It&rsquo;s going to be our little secret. Okay?</p>
<p>Yes, daddy, enjoy the stilettos rubbing your dick, up and down, faster and faster, feel the hard leather sole on the shaft, the sexy heel rubbing you - cum for me, show me, give it to me, cum all over those heels - mmmmhhhh, yes, here we go, daddy - wow, that is quite a load. Yuck! I&rsquo;m all wet &hellip; that was &hellip; awesome.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>You know what? I&rsquo;ll do the cleaning. I don&rsquo;t want to untie you yet.</p>
