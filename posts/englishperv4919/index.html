  "articleBody": "Time flies when you’re having fun, mused Sean. Already 2 weeks had gone by since his first ‘meeting’ with Camelia; she of the luscious middle-eastern complexion, the tiny body and almost prohibitively young age. ‘Almost’ - because Sean had discovered that being wanked by such a little child, giving her a facial and grind-fucking her butt was a specialized and exquisite pleasure. He wanted a repeat and, with luck, to take things to a higher level with her. He was more than willing to make the 250 mile train journey to London once again with his buddy Simon, plus this time Bill. For 65-year-old Bill, it was his first time meeting Camelia and his first time in ‘many many years’ with such a young child. He wasn’t even sure whether he would do anything, and might decide simply to watch. Simon, 37, of course intended to ‘do’ plenty once again. The chubby middle-aged pedo, Anthony, as host, was there again and this time intended to film the 3-hour session with a view to selling the movie.\nTo say Camelia looked happy to see the 3 visitors again would be an exaggeration. She smiled shyly, and said hello sweetly when they greeted her, but then she became more pensive as she recollected the events of 2 weeks ago. This despite the fact she had been warned and ‘made ready’ for their arrival. That comprised her being told to get into the spirit of the ‘game’, and being dressed in a silky and colourful Persian-style dress and her shoulder-length black hair arranged regally in little silver grips. This was at the request of Bill, who had a ‘scenario’ he wanted to enact with her. The specifics of it would depend on Camelia’s mother, Esther; that is, the escalations she would allow in the molesting of her daughter. She was there to meet the men, and final rules were set and promises made, such as convincing her they had the experience and carefulness to penetrate without injuring. Sean, despite arguing the case, was a little sceptical as he thought back to the fingering of her tiny holes last time and her irksome whines of protest. If a finger was stretching possibility, so to speak, then an erect penis would be… well, anyway…\nEsther departed to meet with a wealthy guy - someone quite high in government, apparently - who had paid for an evening out and a hotel night in with her. Sean quite fancied that sexy brown 21-year-old body himself, but not as much as he wanted to grab the chance for really hardcore fun with a pretty 6-year-old. First up, the floor was given to Bill. Things began with him ‘wining and dining’ the child over a centrally-placed table, and chatting affectionately to her, whilst everybody watched. It was very much like a stageplay. Bill told her how she was to be married to him tonight, and that he would take care of her and ’love’ her. It was ‘medieval times’, and the child was a bride given to him for a political alliance. To prove his commitment to the alliance, she had to be fucked vaginally on their ‘wedding night’, and the proof analysed later. Nobody would blame him or the bride, however, if she did not get pregnant by the deed. It was symbolic, though.\n“That’s how things worked in those days,” said Bill.\n“Uh, yeah, okay,” said Sean, sceptically. It was good fun, though, watching the scenario unfold.\n“Just remember, you’ve got a big privilege here,” said Anthony, “in AND out of character. You’re the very first to put it in her.”\n“I know, gee, thanks.”\nBill’s payment had been to let Anthony have a copy of the video of his step-granddaughter, Abigail’s rather disturbing rape by Sean and Simon all those months ago [stories 16-18]. The vid was obviously hot, personal property, and he - Sean too - had no small measure of regret over their treatment of the 10-year-old; cute, freckled and lovely-arsed though she was. She’d been counselled ever since, gone the carefree chirpy child - and the ’two perpetrators’ had never been found. This was partly due to their disguises, but also to the good job Bill had done in making sure she didn’t report it until forensic traces had gone from her.\nLittle Camelia’s descent into the world of sexual abuse was much more carefully managed. When the wedding meal was over, elderly groom and very young bride proceeded hand in hand to the adjoining kitchen. It had been kitted out into a kind of boudoir, with a comfy mattress on the floor and nice sheets, and Venetian blinds were in place in the open doorway as the only ‘privacy’ between the two rooms.\n“That’s how it was in those days,” said Bill.\n“Yeah,” said Simon, with a chuckle.\n“I’m serious. Family, servants and other dignitaries were expected to witness the event, in sound if not sight.”\nHe led Camelia, by now giggling nervously, through the blinds and into her place of rape. She had not been told about this ‘specific’ of a wedding night. From her experiences thus far, she had no reason to suppose that men put anything other than tongue or fingers into a girl’s hole. She gave one last glance at the others as she disappeared. For the next 30 minutes, Sean, Simon and Anthony witnessed the sounds of the continuing fiction and very real physical molesting. The occasional glimpse could be had through the dangling tapes. It seemed Bill started with them being seating together on the mattress for a while, undressed completely, with a slow build-up of delicate touching and kissing. Childish giggles were frequently heard, countered by the somewhat austere instructing by Bill. There was the quiet smack of facial and mouth kisses, coupled with the little chuckles and moans of her coerced soul. He definately spent time sucking and slupping on her little vagina, and maybe her anus too. She appeared to bring the old guy to sufficient erection by a handjob followed by a suck. Bill was heard to admonish her to ‘come on’, at her timid hesitations to take cock in mouth.\n“Still not used to that, is she, I guess?” said Simon.\n“Nope,” said Anthony. “But give her time.”\nThen followed Bill’s attempts at fucking the child. Not easy, even with an experienced 10-year-old such as Hannah. He appeared to switch between three strategies: sitting with her astride his lap, doggy position and missionary. After some minutes of awkward prodding away at her - evidenced by the sound of shuffling, Bill’s mutterings and Camelia’s yelps and whinges - it was the missionary that won the day. They got one tell-tale glimpse of the little tan 6-year-old body on her back, her butt on the very end of the mattress with legs wide open off the end of it. The slight elevation of her puss in this position clearly enabled the ultimate criminal success for Bill. It did not last very long at all. Gutteral gasps from him, and some whimpering from Camelia signalled completion of the ‘wedding’.\nIt also signalled the beginning of the end of any innocence remaining in the 6-year-old’s life. When they emerged, a confirmation close-up was done by Anthony with his camera. Sean and Simon, maintaining the act, expressed their approval that the marriage alliance was sealed. Camelia meanwhile had stopped snivelling - very resilient, little kids are, mused Sean - and now merely bore a look of sulky curiosity at the mess and discomfort in her pee-pee.\n“We could be onto something here,” said Anthony, mainly to Bill. “Damn, man, this is creative. We could make a whole series of movie-stories with the little cutie, and others. We should get good costumes and props to make it real.”\n“Yeah, get Hannah starring in some too,” said Simon. “Abigail, even.”\n“Nice idea,” said Sean. “I don’t anybody will be winning any fucking oscars, though.”\nThey all laughed, whilst the cute little mite merely scowled, not understanding the humour. And Simon and Sean began to psyche themselves up for their own paedophilic fun with her for the next 2 hours.\nThe End\nnext… Sean and Simon have their fun, meanwhile Robert the client revisits Hannah.\n",

He appeared to switch between three strategies: sitting with her astride his lap, doggy position and missionary. After some minutes of awkward prodding away at her - evidenced by the sound of shuffling, Bill&rsquo;s mutterings and Camelia&rsquo;s yelps and whinges - it was the missionary that won the day. They got one tell-tale glimpse of the little tan 6-year-old body on her back, her butt on the very end of the mattress with legs wide open off the end of it. The slight elevation of her puss in this position clearly enabled the ultimate criminal success for Bill. It did not last very long at all. Gutteral gasps from him, and some whimpering from Camelia signalled completion of the &lsquo;wedding&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It also signalled the beginning of the end of any innocence remaining in the 6-year-old&rsquo;s life. When they emerged, a confirmation close-up was done by Anthony with his camera. Sean and Simon, maintaining the act, expressed their approval that the marriage alliance was sealed. Camelia meanwhile had stopped snivelling - very resilient, little kids are, mused Sean - and now merely bore a look of sulky curiosity at the mess and discomfort in her pee-pee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could be onto something here,&rdquo; said Anthony, mainly to Bill. &ldquo;Damn, man, this is creative. We could make a whole series of movie-stories with the little cutie, and others. We should get good costumes and props to make it real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, get Hannah starring in some too,&rdquo; said Simon. &ldquo;Abigail, even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice idea,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t anybody will be winning any fucking oscars, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed, whilst the cute little mite merely scowled, not understanding the humour. And Simon and Sean began to psyche themselves up for their own paedophilic fun with her for the next 2 hours.</p>
<p>The End</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>next&hellip; Sean and Simon have their fun, meanwhile Robert the client revisits Hannah.</strong></p>
