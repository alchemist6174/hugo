  "articleBody": "Thursday morning…\nIt was the day before ‘Abigail day’, and a postcard from Scotland arrived at the home of Sean and Michelle. Michelle was thrilled to hear from her daughter and her important teacher. Such a thing seemed like a sophisticated, old-fashioned novelty to Michelle. She read it. She was actually quite a good reader, and might have made something with her life if she hadn’t been such a slutty and dysfunctional chav in her school days. It was all in Hannah’s childish handwriting:\n“Dear Mum and Sean,”\n“We are having a good time here. The country is nice, and the lodge is nice. We have been walking in the hills, doing games inside, and a bit of schoolwork. Dan is very nice. We have had no accidents.”\nSean smiled wryly to himself, understanding the ‘code’: before Dan left, he had assured him he would be careful not to do any damage with over-exhuberant bedroom sessions with her. The guy must be having the time of his life there, mused Sean, parenting and befriending and teaching and sexing the 9-year-old without a single interruption. It would be interesting to see if Hannah had changed in any way when she returned, even though she was already well used to cocks and cum in her short life.\n“I am looking forward to seeing you all soon.”\n“Aww, isn’t that sweet?” said Michelle.\n“Love and kisses, Hannah xxx”\n“Awww,” said Michelle again. “Isn’t she doin’ well with her spellin’ now too.”\n“Yep,” said Sean. “Dan helped with it, obviously.” Amongst other things, mused Sean.\n“Oh, I dunno, she’s a smart little darlin’, y’know.”\nShe’s a good little slut, mused Sean. “Well, yeah.” The 3 kisses were code too: one for him, Bill and - the pedo she’d not yet met - Simon.\nLater, when Simon came round to review the plans for tomorrow’s adventure, Sean showed him the postcard and he laughed. “Can’t wait to get a taste of that little cutie of yours,” he said.\n“Can’t wait to watch you. So… tomorrow…”\n“Right. God, yeah, tomorrow… I’ve been wanking to Abigail’s pic all week!” said Simon.\n“And I was thinking of her when I fucked Michelle last night!” said Sean.\nWith Michelle out of the way at work, they rehearsed each step of the seizure of ’nice Abigail’, as they’d named her - on account of her being pleasant and sweet-looking but not ‘sexy’ as such. They would simply loiter, heavily diguised and with clothing they would wear only for the deed and never again, so that any description Abigail was brave enough to give of them later would be useless. They’d intercept her as she walked along. The path was narrow and winding through a public park. There would almost certainly be a moment when nobody else was in view, and they would pounce, one man on each of her arms, and calmly but assertively lead her off into the trees with some bullshit about ‘her little brother being taken ill’ and that ’they had come from the hospital to fetch her’. If Abigail made a fuss, a gag would be slapped on her. Bill, who obviously knew her well, reckoned that would not be likely: she would simply ‘obey quietly’, so long as the men acted convincing. It was a half mile walk from there, out of the park boundary, across a railway line, and into wild woodland. There was a small grassy clearing they had earmarked as the place they would rape her.\nTowards the end of the night, Sean recieved a text from Bill:\n‘Good luck tmorrow. Don’t be too heavy. Hope Hannah is well :-) can’t wait to see her again.\nSean texted back:\nDon’t worry, we’ll look after A. H.will be yours again soon, ty, S\u0026S.\n* * * * *\nFriday afternoon…\n“Fucking clockwork!” gushed Simon, as they escorted the increasingly anxious and puzzled child into the clearing.\n“Yes, could not have gone better. Let’s keep a sharp eye and ear out, though.”\n‘Nice Abigail’ was wearing little blue jeans, a red-black striped T-shirt beneath a hooded pink jog top, and she had a little rucksack with her swimming gear - presumably - in it. Her brown hair was in the same slightly tangled, free shoulder-length and fringed style as her pic, but she did not have the cute little pearly earrings. Also, no make-up at all. This was a little girl ‘as nature intended’, about to do the kinds of things that nature ‘did not intend’ for her age. She stood there, glancing to her sides for a moment, and then flitting her eyes nervously between the two men who hovered around her like jackals.\n“Why are we stopping here?” Despite her obvious fear about what she couldn’t understand, her tone was polite and articulate.\n“We’re going to have a quick chat, and then some fun, Abigail,” said Sean, moving on her and taking her face gently in his hands. “You do exactly as we say, and you can carry on to your swimming or go home shortly, okay?”\nHis tone was so earnest, and child-appropriate, that she smiled timidly and nodded. “Okay.” But she was clearly extremely unsettled, even though she didn’t seem to get the meaning of ‘fun’.\n“Got any brothers or sisters, Abigail?” enquired Simon, although they knew she had from Bill’s info.\n“Yes,” she said, politely. Hell she even smiled, almost, taking the man’s small-talk at face value. “I have a brother.”\n“Well, how old? What’s his name?” prodded Simon. “Speak up.”\n“Seven. His name is Ethan.” Abigail’s timid and harmless freckled face looked up at him.\nSimon chuckled. “What kind of name is that?”\n“It’s a fairly normal one,” said Sean. “American, coming into fashion over here I think.”\n“Fair enough. Well, Abigail, I bet Ethan will be wanting you in a few years.” He stressed the ‘you’. Abigail looked blank. “‘Wanting’. Good grief: ‘wanting sex with you, lusting after you, curious to see you naked and stuff.”\nAbigail did not respond. “He’ll probably be curious about that in 2 or 3 years,” said Sean. “She’ll be, like, 13 then. Yeah, he’ll definately be interested by then.”\n“Ohh yeah,” said Simon. “His big sis, Abigail, with her interesting curvy bits and lumps developing.”\n“If he gets a sight of her - which he’ll try to quite a lot - in the bathroom or bedroom,” said Sean, “he’s gonna be doubly interested in those pussy hairs.”\n“Hairs between you legs, on your cunt, your vagina, pubic hairs,” explained Simon to the bemused, silent little girl.\n“Oh,” she said, and the men laughed.\n“He’ll probably be nosey, curious about your bleeds too,” said Simon.\n“Extremely,” said Sean. “A bit grossed out too, though. Let’s face it: it is pretty disgusting.”\n“You know what we’re talking about, don’t you?” probed Simon. “The periods, monthly bleeds from your cunt that you girls get from about 11 or 12”\n“I know,” said the subdued 10-year-old. “I know about that.” In a kind of delayed reaction, she looked at the ground and blushed.\n“Ahh, Mummy has told you, has she?”\n“Yes.”\n“They haven’t started for you yet, have they?” asked Sean, suddenly a bit worried. It would have spoiled the concept of raping a 100% child.\n“No,” said Abigail, simply.\n“Ahh, that’s good,” said Simon. “You can do without that messy nuisance, can’t you?”\n“Yes,” said Abigail.\n“Well, you’re gonna be bleeding from there after we’ve finished with you today,” said Simon, informatively.\n“Why?”\n“For a different reason,” he continued. “Because we’re going to rape you.”\nThe two men watched and waited for some reaction. “It means we’re going to stick our cocks up there - up your little vagina. Did you know that’s what ‘rape’ meant?”\n“Don’t spoil the surprise for her!” said Simon.\n“No,” said Abigail, “uh, I don’t think so.”\n“You don’t think you knew that’s what rape means?” enquired Simon.\n“Yes. I mean no.” She started to snivvle.\n“Ohhh, here we go! The waterworks,” said Simon.\n“Can I go home now?” She restrained her tears for the moment, impressively. “I don’t like to talk about these things.”\n“Me neither,” said Simon. “Let’s just get on with doing it, eh?”\n“Yes,” agreed Sean, firmly. “Time is ticking.”\n“What are you going to do to me?” the frightened child asked.\n“We’ve just told you that!” said Simon. He looked at Sean.\n“Okay,” said Sean, accepting the invitation to decide. “What you do now, Abigail, is take your clothes off. All of them.”\nDistress mounted on her face and in her sweet young eyes. “Why?”\n“We just told you why!” said Simon, half laughing.\n“Take your clothes off, Abigail, hurry up,” said Sean. “We’re gonna get very angry if you don’t.”\n“C-can I go home soon?” She fumbled indecisively before slipping off her top first.\n“No, you cannot fucking go home soon,” snapped Sean. “Keep undressing, not too fast.”\n“And you better promise something,” said Simon, threateningly, as she pulled her T-shirt over her head. Only her eyes responded in frightened attention. “When you’re 16, if not before, you give that little brother of yours a fuck, okay?”\n“What do you mean?”\nSimon chuckled. “It means you go to bed with him, naked, let him kiss you and whatever he wants, and most important of all put his willy into your pussy.”\nAbigail’s spirits were dropping by the second, clinging bewildered to the last of her innocence. “Yeah, at 13 and you being 16 is when he is really going to appreciate that from you,” added Sean.\n“Fucking A,” agreed Simon, as Abigail took her jeans down.\n“Pause!” commanded Sean. Abigail stopped, tensing her narrow shoulders and looking pathetically vulnerable with her short, slim body in small red knickers and an uneccessary training bra.\nThey hovered around her. “Stand still,” ordered Simon, but she was anyway.\n“Look at this,” sniggered Sean, slipping his fingers under her bra strap at her back and giving it a tug. “You don’t need this, you’ve got no tits yet!”\nFor some reason, the tone maybe more than anything else, it was the trigger for Abigail to start crying. She quivered there, staying in place as Sean unclipped her and threw the item on the ground. Then he placed his hands around her, gripping the sides of her rib-cage then groping her chest, particularly letting his fingers slide over her nipples. Meanwhile Simon moved in, knelt in front of her, and unceremoniously yanked her knickers down to her feet. That was not in the plan, but never mind, mused Sean. Simon then roughly lifted each ankle up out of them in turn, while Sean’s clutch balanced her.\n“Mmmm, nice,” said Simon, starting to kiss her belly and grope her narrow hips.\nShe was crying steadily but quietly. “I want to go hooome, please.”\n“Not yet,” said Sean, crisply. Then he grasped a handful of hair on the top of her cute head, and aggressively tilted her face up to his. “Cut that out! Anymore of that talk and we will really hurt you, understand?”\n“Yess,” she squeaked, breathing unevenly.\n“Good,” Sean continued, softening his tone, as Simon was feeling all around her small bottom and down her legs. “I told you, you can go in a little while, but just do everything we say.”\n“Live and learn,” said Simon, sucking her barely-existant breasts.\nThen Sean, keeping his grip of her, forced lingering kisses on her exquisite freckled face and on her mouth. He broke off only momentarily to tell her to let her mouth hang open. The frightened child then recieved a lesson in French-kissing, at the same time as having her little cunt fondled and licked by Simon. Sean’s other hand under her armpit kept her balance under the assault, as she gasped in bewilderment and fear. After a while of ravaging hands and the attentions of men’s mouths all over her, the two adults broke off and looked at each other.\n“Okay, so it’s you first,” said Simon.\nTHE END\nAny feedback such as general feelings, critiques or suggestions for the story welcome in email.\nAlso, I welcome readers to ‘apply’ to become involved by BEING a new character in the story (all fiction of course), or maybe even bringing in a new girl. You would have to pick up from the current last part of the series, though.\n",

      Abducting Nice 10yo Abigail
    </h1>
    <div class="post-description">
      This is part 17 in the Pedophile Ring series. 9yo Hannah is taking a break from the story for a while, as she has been taken on holiday by her schoolteacher/abuser, Dan. Here Sean and his hard-edged pedo buddy, Simon, carry out their abduction of Abigail, stepgranddaughter of Bill (the 3rd of Hannah&#39;s abusers). Can be read from here, but makes more sense if you have followed the previous stories.

<p><em>&ldquo;Love and kisses, Hannah xxx&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Awww,&rdquo; said Michelle again. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she doin&rsquo; well with her spellin&rsquo; now too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;Dan helped with it, obviously.&rdquo; Amongst other things, mused Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dunno, she&rsquo;s a smart little darlin&rsquo;, y&rsquo;know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a good little slut, mused Sean. &ldquo;Well, yeah.&rdquo; The 3 kisses were code too: one for him, Bill and - the pedo she&rsquo;d not yet met - Simon.</p>
<p>Later, when Simon came round to review the plans for tomorrow&rsquo;s adventure, Sean showed him the postcard and he laughed. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait to get a taste of that little cutie of yours,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait to watch you. So&hellip; tomorrow&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. God, yeah, tomorrow&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been wanking to Abigail&rsquo;s pic all week!&rdquo; said Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was thinking of her when I fucked Michelle last night!&rdquo; said Sean.</p>
<p>With Michelle out of the way at work, they rehearsed each step of the seizure of &rsquo;nice Abigail&rsquo;, as they&rsquo;d named her - on account of her being pleasant and sweet-looking but not &lsquo;sexy&rsquo; as such. They would simply loiter, heavily diguised and with clothing they would wear only for the deed and never again, so that any description Abigail was brave enough to give of them later would be useless. They&rsquo;d intercept her as she walked along. The path was narrow and winding through a public park. There would almost certainly be a moment when nobody else was in view, and they would pounce, one man on each of her arms, and calmly but assertively lead her off into the trees with some bullshit about &lsquo;her little brother being taken ill&rsquo; and that &rsquo;they had come from the hospital to fetch her&rsquo;. If Abigail made a fuss, a gag would be slapped on her. Bill, who obviously knew her well, reckoned that would not be likely: she would simply &lsquo;obey quietly&rsquo;, so long as the men acted convincing. It was a half mile walk from there, out of the park boundary, across a railway line, and into wild woodland. There was a small grassy clearing they had earmarked as the place they would rape her.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the night, Sean recieved a text from Bill:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good luck tmorrow. Don&rsquo;t be too heavy. Hope Hannah is well :-) can&rsquo;t wait to see her again.</p>
<p>Sean texted back:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll look after A. H.will be yours again soon, ty, S&amp;S.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Friday afternoon&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fucking clockwork!&rdquo; gushed Simon, as they escorted the increasingly anxious and puzzled child into the clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, could not have gone better. Let&rsquo;s keep a sharp eye and ear out, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nice Abigail&rsquo; was wearing little blue jeans, a red-black striped T-shirt beneath a hooded pink jog top, and she had a little rucksack with her swimming gear - presumably - in it. Her brown hair was in the same slightly tangled, free shoulder-length and fringed style as her pic, but she did not have the cute little pearly earrings. Also, no make-up at all. This was a little girl &lsquo;as nature intended&rsquo;, about to do the kinds of things that nature &lsquo;did not intend&rsquo; for her age. She stood there, glancing to her sides for a moment, and then flitting her eyes nervously between the two men who hovered around her like jackals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are we stopping here?&rdquo; Despite her obvious fear about what she couldn&rsquo;t understand, her tone was polite and articulate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a quick chat, and then some fun, Abigail,&rdquo; said Sean, moving on her and taking her face gently in his hands. &ldquo;You do exactly as we say, and you can carry on to your swimming or go home shortly, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone was so earnest, and child-appropriate, that she smiled timidly and nodded. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; But she was clearly extremely unsettled, even though she didn&rsquo;t seem to get the meaning of &lsquo;fun&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any brothers or sisters, Abigail?&rdquo; enquired Simon, although they knew she had from Bill&rsquo;s info.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, politely. Hell she even smiled, almost, taking the man&rsquo;s small-talk at face value. &ldquo;I have a brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how old? What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; prodded Simon. &ldquo;Speak up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven. His name is Ethan.&rdquo; Abigail&rsquo;s timid and harmless freckled face looked up at him.</p>
<p>Simon chuckled. &ldquo;What kind of name is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fairly normal one,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;American, coming into fashion over here I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough. Well, Abigail, I bet Ethan will be wanting you in a few years.&rdquo; He stressed the &lsquo;you&rsquo;. Abigail looked blank. &ldquo;&lsquo;Wanting&rsquo;. Good grief: &lsquo;wanting sex with you, lusting after you, curious to see you naked and stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abigail did not respond. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably be curious about that in 2 or 3 years,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be, like, 13 then. Yeah, he&rsquo;ll definately be interested by then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohh yeah,&rdquo; said Simon. &ldquo;His big sis, Abigail, with her interesting curvy bits and lumps developing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he gets a sight of her - which he&rsquo;ll try to quite a lot - in the bathroom or bedroom,&rdquo; said Sean, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gonna be doubly interested in those pussy hairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hairs between you legs, on your cunt, your vagina, pubic hairs,&rdquo; explained Simon to the bemused, silent little girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, and the men laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably be nosey, curious about your bleeds too,&rdquo; said Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extremely,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;A bit grossed out too, though. Let&rsquo;s face it: it is pretty disgusting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what we&rsquo;re talking about, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; probed Simon. &ldquo;The periods, monthly bleeds from your cunt that you girls get from about 11 or 12&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the subdued 10-year-old. &ldquo;I know about that.&rdquo; In a kind of delayed reaction, she looked at the ground and blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh, Mummy has told you, has she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t started for you yet, have they?&rdquo; asked Sean, suddenly a bit worried. It would have spoiled the concept of raping a 100% child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Abigail, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh, that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Simon. &ldquo;You can do without that messy nuisance, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Abigail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re gonna be bleeding from there after we&rsquo;ve finished with you today,&rdquo; said Simon, informatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a different reason,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re going to rape you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men watched and waited for some reaction. &ldquo;It means we&rsquo;re going to stick our cocks up there - up your little vagina. Did you know that&rsquo;s what &lsquo;rape&rsquo; meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spoil the surprise for her!&rdquo; said Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Abigail, &ldquo;uh, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think you knew that&rsquo;s what rape means?&rdquo; enquired Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I mean no.&rdquo; She started to snivvle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohhh, here we go! The waterworks,&rdquo; said Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I go home now?&rdquo; She restrained her tears for the moment, impressively. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to talk about these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me neither,&rdquo; said Simon. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get on with doing it, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Sean, firmly. &ldquo;Time is ticking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do to me?&rdquo; the frightened child asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just told you that!&rdquo; said Simon. He looked at Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said Sean, accepting the invitation to decide. &ldquo;What you do now, Abigail, is take your clothes off. All of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Distress mounted on her face and in her sweet young eyes. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just told you why!&rdquo; said Simon, half laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your clothes off, Abigail, hurry up,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna get very angry if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;C-can I go home soon?&rdquo; She fumbled indecisively before slipping off her top first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you cannot fucking go home soon,&rdquo; snapped Sean. &ldquo;Keep undressing, not too fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you better promise something,&rdquo; said Simon, threateningly, as she pulled her T-shirt over her head. Only her eyes responded in frightened attention. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re 16, if not before, you give that little brother of yours a fuck, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simon chuckled. &ldquo;It means you go to bed with him, naked, let him kiss you and whatever he wants, and most important of all put his willy into your pussy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abigail&rsquo;s spirits were dropping by the second, clinging bewildered to the last of her innocence. &ldquo;Yeah, at 13 and you being 16 is when he is really going to appreciate that from you,&rdquo; added Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fucking A,&rdquo; agreed Simon, as Abigail took her jeans down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pause!&rdquo; commanded Sean. Abigail stopped, tensing her narrow shoulders and looking pathetically vulnerable with her short, slim body in small red knickers and an uneccessary training bra.</p>
<p>They hovered around her. &ldquo;Stand still,&rdquo; ordered Simon, but she was anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; sniggered Sean, slipping his fingers under her bra strap at her back and giving it a tug. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need this, you&rsquo;ve got no tits yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some reason, the tone maybe more than anything else, it was the trigger for Abigail to start crying. She quivered there, staying in place as Sean unclipped her and threw the item on the ground. Then he placed his hands around her, gripping the sides of her rib-cage then groping her chest, particularly letting his fingers slide over her nipples. Meanwhile Simon moved in, knelt in front of her, and unceremoniously yanked her knickers down to her feet. That was not in the plan, but never mind, mused Sean. Simon then roughly lifted each ankle up out of them in turn, while Sean&rsquo;s clutch balanced her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmmm, nice,&rdquo; said Simon, starting to kiss her belly and grope her narrow hips.</p>
<p>She was crying steadily but quietly. &ldquo;I want to go hooome, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Sean, crisply. Then he grasped a handful of hair on the top of her cute head, and aggressively tilted her face up to his. &ldquo;Cut that out! Anymore of that talk and we will really hurt you, understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yess,&rdquo; she squeaked, breathing unevenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Sean continued, softening his tone, as Simon was feeling all around her small bottom and down her legs. &ldquo;I told you, you can go in a little while, but just do everything we say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live and learn,&rdquo; said Simon, sucking her barely-existant breasts.</p>
<p>Then Sean, keeping his grip of her, forced lingering kisses on her exquisite freckled face and on her mouth. He broke off only momentarily to tell her to let her mouth hang open. The frightened child then recieved a lesson in French-kissing, at the same time as having her little cunt fondled and licked by Simon. Sean&rsquo;s other hand under her armpit kept her balance under the assault, as she gasped in bewilderment and fear. After a while of ravaging hands and the attentions of men&rsquo;s mouths all over her, the two adults broke off and looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, so it&rsquo;s you first,&rdquo; said Simon.</p>
