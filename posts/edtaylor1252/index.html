  "articleBody": "Tuesday morning begins with another dream. A little elf is blowing me and, even though it was a dream, I know it really isn’t an elf. As I half wake up, the elf is my little four year old granddaughter Stephanie, tonsil deep on my throbbing cock. When I reach down to push her head down further, she scrambles up instead and slides my slick cock deep in her tight little pussy. I grab her hips and fuck her hard as she grins down at me while playing with her engorged little clit. After all of this, it doesn’t take me long to blow my load deep inside her. She isn’t quite done with me and rides my spurting cock as I let go of her. As she cums, she pounds down on my aching cock so hard it hurts. I finally have to grab her to my chest just to stop her from my cock breaking off. She still grinds her little clit into my crotch, twitching as her seemingly endless orgasms continue. Finally, she relaxes and falls asleep on my chest again, as my cock wilts and slides out of her.\nAll this fucking, sucking and jerking over the last few days has left my cock rubbed almost raw. I am going to have to tame this wild child if I, and my cock, have any chance of survival. Hopefully, I can find some sweet young thing at tonight Parents without Partners meeting to distract both me and Stephanie.\nAfter another bath and breakfast, during which I manage to keep Steph’s hands, and other body parts, off my cock, I take Stephanie into the office with me. I do have a couple of meetings I need to take. Sooner or later, I am going to have to get a babysitter or someone to take care of Steph during the day, but for now Moira, my efficient, if strictly business, middle aged secretary, doesn’t seem to mind riding herd on Steph while I take care of a little business.\nOne of the calls I get is from my lawyer, Stu.\n“What the hell is going on??” he demands as soon as I say “Hello.”\nI had sent him copies of all of the porn videos Dagny had made with her, Stephanie and half the local police department, among others. I fill him in with the happenings of the weekend, ending with “I found those recordings in the wreckage of Dagny’s house. They have already come in handy when Officer Brown, one of Dagny’s unsuspecting porn stars, came to visit with a rather nasty bitch from Child Protective Services. They decided to leave Stephanie with me.”\n“Stephanie is the little co-star in these videos?” he asks.\n“Yup, she’s my granddaughter, more or less. She more than a handful, too.” I decide not to tell Stu, at this point, what part of me Steph likes to keep in her hand full of my cock, either. “I’m the closest thing she has to family left.”\n“Do you really want this kind of shit in your life, Ed? I mean, Ed…the list of people she got video of…damn. I could put a major chuck of the police force and DA’s Office in jail with this stuff. This could get really dangerous, really quick, for both of us.”\n“Yes, I know, Stu. But as Officer Brown was leaving, I told him I made backup for my safety, but I want to keep all of this quiet for everyone’s. He agreed. I’m sure word will get around the police department. Perhaps you could have lunch with, what was that ADA’s name, and tell him, too.”\n“Joe Summers. Hell, we’re on the Bar’s Ethics Committee together.” Stu lets out a short bitter laugh. “I’ve only looked at one or two of these videos. They are incredible. Quite frankly, most of it turns my stomach. How is the kid doing?”\n“Not too bad, considering. Trouble sleeping and the like. She’s scared to death of going back into foster care. The little kid has had a hard life, and she’s only four.”\n“You got that right. Look, let me make some calls.”\nI have a few more calls and some meetings. I take Steph down to Dairy Queen for lunch. The kid inhales her lunch and half of mine, along with most of the banana split we split. I am going to have to start being careful about what she’s eating, but for now, I am spoiling her. We stop by the store and buy some more toys and dolls on the way back to the office. Steph is happy and play in the corner behind Moira’s desk while I tried to get some deals put together.\nA little while later, Moira comes in and closes my door, which is a bit unusual.\n“What’s up, M? Stephanie running you ragged?”\n“No, nothing like that, she’s taking a nap on the couch.”\n“Oh, Okay. So…?”\n“Well, it’s just that…I’m not sure but…”\nIt’s quite unlike Moira to beat around the bush like this. She’s usually quite no-nonsense. “What is it? Is something wrong with Steph?”\n“Well, sort of, I guess. You know, Miss Stephanie was playing with her new dolls this afternoon, and, um…”\n“Spit it out, M. It’s not like you to be so reticent.”\n“Well, sir, it’s… it’s the things she was making the dolls do sir. I’ve never heard a girl her age every say those words. How…How does she…” Moira looked like she was about to burst into tears.\n“Oh, dear… my…” Now I was at a loss for words… I decide to tell her some of what is going on. “Well, can I tell you a few things in confidence, Moira?” She nods. “Stephanie was abused by her mother and her boyfriend.” I decide to leave out ‘and half the police force.’ “She’s in need of a lot of help, and I’m the only one she has left.”\nMoira nods again. “I understand, sir,” and then she falls silent.\n“Are you ok, Moira? You haven’t called me sir since you interviewed here five years ago.” I get up and come around the desk, but she flinches away from me. I give her some space, and sit on the edge of my desk. “Moira, can I ask you something personal?” She looks up at me, a scared, but doesn’t say anything. Finally she nods, almost imperceptibly. “You have some experience with abuse, don’t you?”\nShe bursts into tears, burying her face in her hands, and just sobs uncontrollably for a good five minutes. I don’t dare try to console or touch her, so after offering her the box of Kleenex off my desk, I go back and sit behind my desk. Finally she pulls herself together. “I’m sorry, sir,” she says between sniffs, “I’ve never told anyone.” She breaks down again for a minute.\nI get up and pour myself a scotch and a vodka rocks for her, which was her drink on our one date, years ago.\n“Thanks,” she manages, then downs it in one gulp. I let the silence stretch, and she finally fills it. “I must look a mess.” She does a bit.\n“Don’t worry about it, M. You’ve seen me in worse states.” She has too. She’s driven me home after a few six-martini dinners with clients. “I’m sorry if what’s going on with Stephanie has brought up…I don’t know…issues for you, but you know you can tell me anything.”\nShe nods, then gets up and refills her drink, this time without the ice knocking it back again and pours another. I want to tell her to slow down, but I’m not exactly one to talk about tea-totaling.\nMoira wanders out to her desk, only weaving a bit, and grabs her purse. Thru the open door I see Steph asleep on the couch with one hand on her crotch. Her new Barbie and Ken are clearly deep in 69 next to her. Moira pulls out a mirror, straightens out her face and takes a few deep breaths. She comes back, leaving the door open and sits down again.\nLooking out the window for a long moment, she finally says, “It was my step-father. It started when I was 12. He beat me, too. God…it went on until I left home at 18.” She pauses for a few more deep breaths, then falls silent, seemingly lost.\n“I’m so sorry, Moira.”\nShe looks straight at me, fixing me in my seat, saying “Thanks, but you didn’t do it. And the bastard that did is long dead,” then falls silent again.\n“I hope he suffered,” I offer.\nShe gives a short laugh and smiles for the first time. “Yeah, he did. Cirrhosis and lung cancer. I didn’t go to his funeral.” She sips her vodka for a few minutes, just breathing.\nI notice something. She’s sitting up straighter, and something else, too. “Moira, you look like you’ve had a burden lifted from you.”\n“Really?”\n“Yeah, and I swear you look ten years younger.”\nShe pulls out her mirror and looks at herself, amazed. “Wow,” she says softly. “I should have told someone years ago.”\n“Branka?” I hear from Stephanie stirring on the couch out in reception.\n“In here, Steph,” I call out to her.\n“I gotta pee,” Steph says, squirming, after she reaches the doorway.\nI start to get up to take Steph down the hall, but Moira gets up. “I’ll take her, Ed.”\nThey are back a few minutes later. Moira looks like a new woman and Stephanie is no longer squirming. I notice the time. “We’re going to be late for the Parents thing at the church. You going to be ok, M?” I ask.\n“Yeah, I think so, Ed. Thanks for listening.”\n“Sorry all of this came up. I’m not sure what to do about Steph and all of this. Can I talk to you more about it tomorrow?”\n“Sure, I’ll bring extra Kleenex, if I need it.”\n“I’m so sorry, M. I’ll sort all of this out myself.”\nMoira tousles Steph’s hair, who can’t quite figure out what is going on. “No, all of this is long overdue for me, and the sooner the better for little Miss Stephanie.”\n“Thanks, M. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”\n***\nThe Parents without Partners meeting at the church on Tuesday is fairly small, about five or six parents and a dozen or so kids. The younger kids are playing with toys and dolls in one corner of the room, while the older ones moped in the opposite corner. Thankfully, Stephanie recognizes one of the other little girls and they start playing Barbies or Bratz or something right off. I don’t recognize anyone, so I hang back, keeping an eye on Steph. One young woman recognized Steph. She’s short and skinny with short dark hair and big eyes. She moves with a dancer’s grace as she came over and leans down next to Stephanie.\n“Hi, Mommy,” the other little girl says.\n“Hey Steph, what are you doing here?” the mom asks, a looking a little confused and troubled.\nSteph looks up and smiles, “Branka brought me,” then points to me.\nI start to walk over and the mom meets me halfway with a big hug, almost leaping into my arms, then bursts into tears.\nAfter a moment, she collects herself, but doesn’t pull back. “I’m so sorry, I’m Julie.” She gives me a watery smile and seems to almost want to kiss me. “I’m so sorry for your loss,” she says as a tear slides down her cheek again.\nI hug her back. She’s thin but I feel her small tits squash between us. “Loss?” I ask, being my usual dense self.\n“I knew Dagny,” she says, adding “down at the club. You must be Andrew?”\n“Edward, actually.” I try to step back a bit, but Julie holds me close, her head on my chest. Being this close to a pretty woman is making me a little hard, but she either doesn’t notice or doesn’t care.\n“I told Dag to leave that bastard, but she never listens,” she mumbles into my chest.\n“She never listened to anyone, least of all me,” I agree.\n“So you got stuck with Stephanie.” It isn’t a question.\n“Yeah, I guess, but she’s a real charmer.”\n“Well at least she and my little Natalie are getting along.” She looks over to where the girls are whispering back and forth, glancing over at the two of us and giggling.\n“That’s good, I was worried about finding her someone her own age to play with,” I add.\nJulie nods and smiles again, this time with a little more conviction, “I guess if you’re here, you haven’t found anyone your age for you to play with.”\nI smile back, “I don’t think I want anyone my age, anyway,” and wink.\n“Good thing I like older men, then,” she winks back and strokes my cock thru my slacks.\n“Do tell,” I almost moan.\n“Oh, all in good time, I think,” she defers. “I’ve always preferred a man with experience. Most of the men I’ve met here are pretty hopeless. They are looking for more of a mommy than a wife. What are you looking for?”\n“I wasn’t sure what I’d find, quite frankly. Maybe I’m looking for more of a babysitter than a mommy.” I regretted it as soon as I said it.\n“Hah,” she laughs. “It’s been a long time since I was a babysitter. That sounds like a fun little game. Why don’t we go home and play it tonight,” and gives my cock another squeeze.\n“Really?” I’m not sure whether to be shocked or pleased.\n“Just look around at these losers here,” she says, “I’m so glad I finally met someone here I can really play with.”\nI’m taken a bit aback, but… “Sure, let’s go.” The minister’s just trying to gather folks together to get started when we get up, gather the girls and leave. Covering my hard cock with my jacket in front of me, I give him an apologetic shrug as we leave. He seems rather nonplussed.\n“You still live on Tryon Street?” Julie asks me in the parking lot.\n“Yeah, you want to follow me there?”\n“Nah, I need to get a few things at home, if that’s ok?”\n“Sure, sure.”\nWhen we get home, I turn on some cartoons for Stephanie and I’m making some quick supper in the kitchen. I hear a knock at the front door. When I open the door, Julie is dressed in a school uniform of white oxford shirt, red plaid skirt, knee sox, patent leather shoes. Her shoulder length brown hair is tied in pigtails. She’s holding little Natalie by the hand, who is dressed in an identical outfit, down to the matching pink elastics in her brown hair, too. Before I have a chance to invite them in, Julie launches into a sales pitch.\n“Hello Mister, My name is Julie Alexander and this is my little sister Natalie. We’re collecting for our school band. We need new uniforms. Can I interest you in making a donation?” She looks down at the floor, or is it my hardening cock, and kinda squirms and wiggles like a little girl asking for a favor.\nI play right along, “Well, I see, Miss Alexander. I’m sure we can come to some arrangement.” I am getting really turned on by her little girl routine and would like to get them inside off my front porch so my nosy neighbors won’t notice. “Why don’t you come inside while I find my wallet.”\nI show them into the living room\nJulie and I sit on the couch while Natalie sits on the floor in front of the TV with Steph. I notice I can see up Natalie’s skirt and she is wearing frilly white panties. Julie follows my eye and smiles as she gets my attention by “adjusting” her skirt and flashing her matching undies.\n“So, Miss Alexander, I’m Ed Taylor. I am a big supporter of our local schools. What can you tell me about this fundraising plan of yours.”\n“Well, Mr. Taylor…”\n“Please call me Ed, Julie, if I may call you that.”\n“Sure thing, Mr…I mean, Ed. Umm, oh, let me see….” she sputters to a stop. She’s looking at my growing cock and her nipples stiffen, too.\n“Oh, dear, I know that asking for money is so hard, Julie. Just come right out and tell me what the expected donation is.”\n“Well, um, Mister, I mean, Ed. Most people are donating $5 or so, but… I’m trying to win the fund raising contest, but I haven’t gotten a single donation at all this afternoon, and, and…” and she burst into tears.\nI take her into my arms and comfort her. I’m always amazed at women that can cry on cue. She crawls up into my lap and just bawls. I’m afraid this isn’t just playing around anymore. I hold her and whisper “It’s OK, Julie, it’ll be all right.”\nThe sobbing slows and she turns her tear streaked face up to mine and kisses me, timidly at first, then harder, sliding her tongue into my mouth, probing. She grinds her crotch into mine. She’s become almost an animal, demanding, nearly sucking the breath out of me. I break our kiss and she says, “I’m sorry.”\n“It’s OK,” I assure her.\n“I’ve lost so many people. Not just Dag, but my Dad, too. And Nattie’s father walked out and…” and she bursts into tears again.\nThis must be my day for crying females. “There, there, I’m here now.” I hold her tight and let her cry. Natalie and Stephanie are watching us now instead of the cartoons and look a little worried. I smile at them and mouth ‘It’s OK’ to them as I pat Julie and rock her. After a little while longer, I tell them, “Why don’t you two girls go play in your room, Steph?” She nods and takes Natalie down the hall.\nWith the girls gone, Julie cries harder, holding onto tightly, now almost wailing. I hold her and rock her. I kiss her gently on the head, telling her, “It’s ok…I know…Let it all out…I won’t let you go…” After a long while, she finally begins to wind down.\nAs Julie cries, I think about everything that has happened…and what I’ve done about it. I have not reacted well at all. I vow to myself to never touch Stephanie again. Especially after talking to Moira this afternoon and hearing what her abuse did to her. I look down at this young woman dressed like a schoolgirl weeping in my lap. At least she’s over 18. It seems like all of this has reawakened something, my sex drive, I guess. At least fucking Julie won’t land me in jail.\nAt last, Julie looks up at me and smiles a little. “Tanks, I tink neebeb dat,” her nose is all runny and her eyes are red. Luckily, she’s not wearing much make-up. I hand her my handkerchief and she wipes her eyes and blows her nose. “God, I must look like shit.”\nI kiss her gently, “You look just fine.”\nShe kisses me back, then harder and grinds into me again. She grabs my hands and puts them on her tits as she unbuttons her shirt. She’s not wearing a bra as I reach inside and fondle her firm natural tits. They’re not the usual dancers over inflated tits, just perfect, firm and natural. She begins to unbutton my shirt too as we fall back onto the couch, my mouth finding her lovely tits. She moans as I suckle from her teenage sized tits. I pull at her lacy underwear and she lifts up to help. I fall between her legs and lap her deliciously waxed pussy. I always appreciate a girl who knows what naked really means. She grabs my head and starts to moan “Daddy, Daddy, Daddy…” as I tongue her juicy pussy.\nI kick off my pants and boxers. To get more room to play, I pull her down onto the lambskin rug in front of the couch. She lands on top of me, turns around and sucks my throbbing dick deep. I continue to suck her slick cunt, tonguing her as she moans around my cock.\nShe’s quite a pro when it comes to sucking cock and it’s not long before I’m about to cum. She senses my coming orgasm, spins around and impales herself on my hard cock. She screams “Fuck Me DADDY!” as she slams down on my throbbing cock. She pounds up and down on me hard yelling “OH, DADDY! OH, DADDY!” with each stroke. I can only take a few moments of this and I cum hard deep inside her. As she feels my hot cum spraying inside her, she screams, “YES, YES, YES” and cums too, shuddering inside and out.\nI grab her as she collapses on top of me. We are both breathing hard and holding each other. She still mumbles “daddy… daddy… daddy…” As we come to our senses, she kisses me deeply, and says “Oh, that was great, Daddy,” then slides down and cleans my deflating cock with her expert tongue. She twirls around and I lick her cum soaked pussy. I normally don’t like creampies, but seeing it drip out of her bald girl like cunt makes for an exception. I realize we should have used a condom, but it’s a little late at this point. I’m getting hard again as she sucks me clean and we’re about to do it with me on top. As I come to attention, Julia lies back on the rug and whispers, “Fuck me, Daddy.” I am about to just that when we hear moaning coming down the hall from my granddaughters bedroom.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Tuesday morning begins with another dream. A little elf is blowing me and, even though it was a dream, I know it really isn&rsquo;t an elf. As I half wake up, the elf is my little four year old granddaughter Stephanie, tonsil deep on my throbbing cock. When I reach down to push her head down further, she scrambles up instead and slides my slick cock deep in her tight little pussy. I grab her hips and fuck her hard as she grins down at me while playing with her engorged little clit. After all of this, it doesn&rsquo;t take me long to blow my load deep inside her. She isn&rsquo;t quite done with me and rides my spurting cock as I let go of her. As she cums, she pounds down on my aching cock so hard it hurts. I finally have to grab her to my chest just to stop her from my cock breaking off. She still grinds her little clit into my crotch, twitching as her seemingly endless orgasms continue. Finally, she relaxes and falls asleep on my chest again, as my cock wilts and slides out of her.</p>
<p>All this fucking, sucking and jerking over the last few days has left my cock rubbed almost raw. I am going to have to tame this wild child if I, and my cock, have any chance of survival. Hopefully, I can find some sweet young thing at tonight Parents without Partners meeting to distract both me and Stephanie.</p>
<p>After another bath and breakfast, during which I manage to keep Steph&rsquo;s hands, and other body parts, off my cock, I take Stephanie into the office with me. I do have a couple of meetings I need to take. Sooner or later, I am going to have to get a babysitter or someone to take care of Steph during the day, but for now Moira, my efficient, if strictly business, middle aged secretary, doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind riding herd on Steph while I take care of a little business.</p>
<p>One of the calls I get is from my lawyer, Stu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell is going on??&rdquo; he demands as soon as I say &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had sent him copies of all of the porn videos Dagny had made with her, Stephanie and half the local police department, among others. I fill him in with the happenings of the weekend, ending with &ldquo;I found those recordings in the wreckage of Dagny&rsquo;s house. They have already come in handy when Officer Brown, one of Dagny&rsquo;s unsuspecting porn stars, came to visit with a rather nasty bitch from Child Protective Services. They decided to leave Stephanie with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stephanie is the little co-star in these videos?&rdquo; he asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup, she&rsquo;s my granddaughter, more or less. She more than a handful, too.&rdquo; I decide not to tell Stu, at this point, what part of me Steph likes to keep in her hand full of my cock, either. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the closest thing she has to family left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really want this kind of shit in your life, Ed? I mean, Ed&hellip;the list of people she got video of&hellip;damn. I could put a major chuck of the police force and DA&rsquo;s Office in jail with this stuff. This could get really dangerous, really quick, for both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, Stu. But as Officer Brown was leaving, I told him I made backup for my safety, but I want to keep all of this quiet for everyone&rsquo;s. He agreed. I&rsquo;m sure word will get around the police department. Perhaps you could have lunch with, what was that ADA&rsquo;s name, and tell him, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Summers. Hell, we&rsquo;re on the Bar&rsquo;s Ethics Committee together.&rdquo; Stu lets out a short bitter laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only looked at one or two of these videos. They are incredible. Quite frankly, most of it turns my stomach. How is the kid doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too bad, considering. Trouble sleeping and the like. She&rsquo;s scared to death of going back into foster care. The little kid has had a hard life, and she&rsquo;s only four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got that right. Look, let me make some calls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have a few more calls and some meetings. I take Steph down to Dairy Queen for lunch. The kid inhales her lunch and half of mine, along with most of the banana split we split. I am going to have to start being careful about what she&rsquo;s eating, but for now, I am spoiling her. We stop by the store and buy some more toys and dolls on the way back to the office. Steph is happy and play in the corner behind Moira&rsquo;s desk while I tried to get some deals put together.</p>
<p>A little while later, Moira comes in and closes my door, which is a bit unusual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, M? Stephanie running you ragged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing like that, she&rsquo;s taking a nap on the couch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Okay. So&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just that&hellip;I&rsquo;m not sure but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite unlike Moira to beat around the bush like this. She&rsquo;s usually quite no-nonsense. &ldquo;What is it? Is something wrong with Steph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sort of, I guess. You know, Miss Stephanie was playing with her new dolls this afternoon, and, um&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spit it out, M. It&rsquo;s not like you to be so reticent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s the things she was making the dolls do sir. I&rsquo;ve never heard a girl her age every say those words. How&hellip;How does she&hellip;&rdquo; Moira looked like she was about to burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear&hellip; my&hellip;&rdquo; Now I was at a loss for words&hellip; I decide to tell her some of what is going on. &ldquo;Well, can I tell you a few things in confidence, Moira?&rdquo; She nods. &ldquo;Stephanie was abused by her mother and her boyfriend.&rdquo; I decide to leave out &lsquo;and half the police force.&rsquo; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in need of a lot of help, and I&rsquo;m the only one she has left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moira nods again. &ldquo;I understand, sir,&rdquo; and then she falls silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ok, Moira? You haven&rsquo;t called me sir since you interviewed here five years ago.&rdquo; I get up and come around the desk, but she flinches away from me. I give her some space, and sit on the edge of my desk. &ldquo;Moira, can I ask you something personal?&rdquo; She looks up at me, a scared, but doesn&rsquo;t say anything. Finally she nods, almost imperceptibly. &ldquo;You have some experience with abuse, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bursts into tears, burying her face in her hands, and just sobs uncontrollably for a good five minutes. I don&rsquo;t dare try to console or touch her, so after offering her the box of Kleenex off my desk, I go back and sit behind my desk. Finally she pulls herself together. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir,&rdquo; she says between sniffs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never told anyone.&rdquo; She breaks down again for a minute.</p>
<p>I get up and pour myself a scotch and a vodka rocks for her, which was her drink on our one date, years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she manages, then downs it in one gulp. I let the silence stretch, and she finally fills it. &ldquo;I must look a mess.&rdquo; She does a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, M. You&rsquo;ve seen me in worse states.&rdquo; She has too. She&rsquo;s driven me home after a few six-martini dinners with clients. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if what&rsquo;s going on with Stephanie has brought up&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;issues for you, but you know you can tell me anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nods, then gets up and refills her drink, this time without the ice knocking it back again and pours another. I want to tell her to slow down, but I&rsquo;m not exactly one to talk about tea-totaling.</p>
<p>Moira wanders out to her desk, only weaving a bit, and grabs her purse. Thru the open door I see Steph asleep on the couch with one hand on her crotch. Her new Barbie and Ken are clearly deep in 69 next to her. Moira pulls out a mirror, straightens out her face and takes a few deep breaths. She comes back, leaving the door open and sits down again.</p>
<p>Looking out the window for a long moment, she finally says, &ldquo;It was my step-father. It started when I was 12. He beat me, too. God&hellip;it went on until I left home at 18.&rdquo; She pauses for a few more deep breaths, then falls silent, seemingly lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Moira.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looks straight at me, fixing me in my seat, saying &ldquo;Thanks, but you didn&rsquo;t do it. And the bastard that did is long dead,&rdquo; then falls silent again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he suffered,&rdquo; I offer.</p>
<p>She gives a short laugh and smiles for the first time. &ldquo;Yeah, he did. Cirrhosis and lung cancer. I didn&rsquo;t go to his funeral.&rdquo; She sips her vodka for a few minutes, just breathing.</p>
<p>I notice something. She&rsquo;s sitting up straighter, and something else, too. &ldquo;Moira, you look like you&rsquo;ve had a burden lifted from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, and I swear you look ten years younger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pulls out her mirror and looks at herself, amazed. &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she says softly. &ldquo;I should have told someone years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Branka?&rdquo; I hear from Stephanie stirring on the couch out in reception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In here, Steph,&rdquo; I call out to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gotta pee,&rdquo; Steph says, squirming, after she reaches the doorway.</p>
<p>I start to get up to take Steph down the hall, but Moira gets up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take her, Ed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are back a few minutes later. Moira looks like a new woman and Stephanie is no longer squirming. I notice the time. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be late for the Parents thing at the church. You going to be ok, M?&rdquo; I ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think so, Ed. Thanks for listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry all of this came up. I&rsquo;m not sure what to do about Steph and all of this. Can I talk to you more about it tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll bring extra Kleenex, if I need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, M. I&rsquo;ll sort all of this out myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moira tousles Steph&rsquo;s hair, who can&rsquo;t quite figure out what is going on. &ldquo;No, all of this is long overdue for me, and the sooner the better for little Miss Stephanie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, M. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Parents without Partners meeting at the church on Tuesday is fairly small, about five or six parents and a dozen or so kids. The younger kids are playing with toys and dolls in one corner of the room, while the older ones moped in the opposite corner. Thankfully, Stephanie recognizes one of the other little girls and they start playing Barbies or Bratz or something right off. I don&rsquo;t recognize anyone, so I hang back, keeping an eye on Steph. One young woman recognized Steph. She&rsquo;s short and skinny with short dark hair and big eyes. She moves with a dancer&rsquo;s grace as she came over and leans down next to Stephanie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Mommy,&rdquo; the other little girl says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey Steph, what are you doing here?&rdquo; the mom asks, a looking a little confused and troubled.</p>
<p>Steph looks up and smiles, &ldquo;Branka brought me,&rdquo; then points to me.</p>
<p>I start to walk over and the mom meets me halfway with a big hug, almost leaping into my arms, then bursts into tears.</p>
<p>After a moment, she collects herself, but doesn&rsquo;t pull back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, I&rsquo;m Julie.&rdquo; She gives me a watery smile and seems to almost want to kiss me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry for your loss,&rdquo; she says as a tear slides down her cheek again.</p>
<p>I hug her back. She&rsquo;s thin but I feel her small tits squash between us. &ldquo;Loss?&rdquo; I ask, being my usual dense self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew Dagny,&rdquo; she says, adding &ldquo;down at the club. You must be Andrew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward, actually.&rdquo; I try to step back a bit, but Julie holds me close, her head on my chest. Being this close to a pretty woman is making me a little hard, but she either doesn&rsquo;t notice or doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told Dag to leave that bastard, but she never listens,&rdquo; she mumbles into my chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never listened to anyone, least of all me,&rdquo; I agree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you got stuck with Stephanie.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess, but she&rsquo;s a real charmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well at least she and my little Natalie are getting along.&rdquo; She looks over to where the girls are whispering back and forth, glancing over at the two of us and giggling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, I was worried about finding her someone her own age to play with,&rdquo; I add.</p>
<p>Julie nods and smiles again, this time with a little more conviction, &ldquo;I guess if you&rsquo;re here, you haven&rsquo;t found anyone your age for you to play with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smile back, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I want anyone my age, anyway,&rdquo; and wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing I like older men, then,&rdquo; she winks back and strokes my cock thru my slacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell,&rdquo; I almost moan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all in good time, I think,&rdquo; she defers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always preferred a man with experience. Most of the men I&rsquo;ve met here are pretty hopeless. They are looking for more of a mommy than a wife. What are you looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I&rsquo;d find, quite frankly. Maybe I&rsquo;m looking for more of a babysitter than a mommy.&rdquo; I regretted it as soon as I said it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah,&rdquo; she laughs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since I was a babysitter. That sounds like a fun little game. Why don&rsquo;t we go home and play it tonight,&rdquo; and gives my cock another squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure whether to be shocked or pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look around at these losers here,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I finally met someone here I can really play with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taken a bit aback, but&hellip; &ldquo;Sure, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; The minister&rsquo;s just trying to gather folks together to get started when we get up, gather the girls and leave. Covering my hard cock with my jacket in front of me, I give him an apologetic shrug as we leave. He seems rather nonplussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still live on Tryon Street?&rdquo; Julie asks me in the parking lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, you want to follow me there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nah, I need to get a few things at home, if that&rsquo;s ok?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we get home, I turn on some cartoons for Stephanie and I&rsquo;m making some quick supper in the kitchen. I hear a knock at the front door. When I open the door, Julie is dressed in a school uniform of white oxford shirt, red plaid skirt, knee sox, patent leather shoes. Her shoulder length brown hair is tied in pigtails. She&rsquo;s holding little Natalie by the hand, who is dressed in an identical outfit, down to the matching pink elastics in her brown hair, too. Before I have a chance to invite them in, Julie launches into a sales pitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello Mister, My name is Julie Alexander and this is my little sister Natalie. We&rsquo;re collecting for our school band. We need new uniforms. Can I interest you in making a donation?&rdquo; She looks down at the floor, or is it my hardening cock, and kinda squirms and wiggles like a little girl asking for a favor.</p>
<p>I play right along, &ldquo;Well, I see, Miss Alexander. I&rsquo;m sure we can come to some arrangement.&rdquo; I am getting really turned on by her little girl routine and would like to get them inside off my front porch so my nosy neighbors won&rsquo;t notice. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come inside while I find my wallet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I show them into the living room</p>
<p>Julie and I sit on the couch while Natalie sits on the floor in front of the TV with Steph. I notice I can see up Natalie&rsquo;s skirt and she is wearing frilly white panties. Julie follows my eye and smiles as she gets my attention by &ldquo;adjusting&rdquo; her skirt and flashing her matching undies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Miss Alexander, I&rsquo;m Ed Taylor. I am a big supporter of our local schools. What can you tell me about this fundraising plan of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Taylor&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please call me Ed, Julie, if I may call you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, Mr&hellip;I mean, Ed. Umm, oh, let me see&hellip;.&rdquo; she sputters to a stop. She&rsquo;s looking at my growing cock and her nipples stiffen, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, I know that asking for money is so hard, Julie. Just come right out and tell me what the expected donation is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, um, Mister, I mean, Ed. Most people are donating $5 or so, but&hellip; I&rsquo;m trying to win the fund raising contest, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten a single donation at all this afternoon, and, and&hellip;&rdquo; and she burst into tears.</p>
<p>I take her into my arms and comfort her. I&rsquo;m always amazed at women that can cry on cue. She crawls up into my lap and just bawls. I&rsquo;m afraid this isn&rsquo;t just playing around anymore. I hold her and whisper &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK, Julie, it&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sobbing slows and she turns her tear streaked face up to mine and kisses me, timidly at first, then harder, sliding her tongue into my mouth, probing. She grinds her crotch into mine. She&rsquo;s become almost an animal, demanding, nearly sucking the breath out of me. I break our kiss and she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; I assure her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost so many people. Not just Dag, but my Dad, too. And Nattie&rsquo;s father walked out and&hellip;&rdquo; and she bursts into tears again.</p>
<p>This must be my day for crying females. &ldquo;There, there, I&rsquo;m here now.&rdquo; I hold her tight and let her cry. Natalie and Stephanie are watching us now instead of the cartoons and look a little worried. I smile at them and mouth &lsquo;It&rsquo;s OK&rsquo; to them as I pat Julie and rock her. After a little while longer, I tell them, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you two girls go play in your room, Steph?&rdquo; She nods and takes Natalie down the hall.</p>
<p>With the girls gone, Julie cries harder, holding onto tightly, now almost wailing. I hold her and rock her. I kiss her gently on the head, telling her, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok&hellip;I know&hellip;Let it all out&hellip;I won&rsquo;t let you go&hellip;&rdquo; After a long while, she finally begins to wind down.</p>
<p>As Julie cries, I think about everything that has happened&hellip;and what I&rsquo;ve done about it. I have not reacted well at all. I vow to myself to never touch Stephanie again. Especially after talking to Moira this afternoon and hearing what her abuse did to her. I look down at this young woman dressed like a schoolgirl weeping in my lap. At least she&rsquo;s over 18. It seems like all of this has reawakened something, my sex drive, I guess. At least fucking Julie won&rsquo;t land me in jail.</p>
<p>At last, Julie looks up at me and smiles a little. &ldquo;Tanks, I tink neebeb dat,&rdquo; her nose is all runny and her eyes are red. Luckily, she&rsquo;s not wearing much make-up. I hand her my handkerchief and she wipes her eyes and blows her nose. &ldquo;God, I must look like shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I kiss her gently, &ldquo;You look just fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kisses me back, then harder and grinds into me again. She grabs my hands and puts them on her tits as she unbuttons her shirt. She&rsquo;s not wearing a bra as I reach inside and fondle her firm natural tits. They&rsquo;re not the usual dancers over inflated tits, just perfect, firm and natural. She begins to unbutton my shirt too as we fall back onto the couch, my mouth finding her lovely tits. She moans as I suckle from her teenage sized tits. I pull at her lacy underwear and she lifts up to help. I fall between her legs and lap her deliciously waxed pussy. I always appreciate a girl who knows what naked really means. She grabs my head and starts to moan &ldquo;Daddy, Daddy, Daddy&hellip;&rdquo; as I tongue her juicy pussy.</p>
<p>I kick off my pants and boxers. To get more room to play, I pull her down onto the lambskin rug in front of the couch. She lands on top of me, turns around and sucks my throbbing dick deep. I continue to suck her slick cunt, tonguing her as she moans around my cock.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s quite a pro when it comes to sucking cock and it&rsquo;s not long before I&rsquo;m about to cum. She senses my coming orgasm, spins around and impales herself on my hard cock. She screams &ldquo;Fuck Me DADDY!&rdquo; as she slams down on my throbbing cock. She pounds up and down on me hard yelling &ldquo;OH, DADDY! OH, DADDY!&rdquo; with each stroke. I can only take a few moments of this and I cum hard deep inside her. As she feels my hot cum spraying inside her, she screams, &ldquo;YES, YES, YES&rdquo; and cums too, shuddering inside and out.</p>
<p>I grab her as she collapses on top of me. We are both breathing hard and holding each other. She still mumbles &ldquo;daddy&hellip; daddy&hellip; daddy&hellip;&rdquo; As we come to our senses, she kisses me deeply, and says &ldquo;Oh, that was great, Daddy,&rdquo; then slides down and cleans my deflating cock with her expert tongue. She twirls around and I lick her cum soaked pussy. I normally don&rsquo;t like creampies, but seeing it drip out of her bald girl like cunt makes for an exception. I realize we should have used a condom, but it&rsquo;s a little late at this point. I&rsquo;m getting hard again as she sucks me clean and we&rsquo;re about to do it with me on top. As I come to attention, Julia lies back on the rug and whispers, &ldquo;Fuck me, Daddy.&rdquo; I am about to just that when we hear moaning coming down the hall from my granddaughters bedroom.</p>
