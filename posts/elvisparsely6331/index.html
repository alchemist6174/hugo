  "articleBody": "Adding to the Mix The women looked on as Klaus, and I drove out from the driveway on to the Five Mile road.\n“I hope Glen doesn’t act like Glen,” said Anna.\n“Why?” Was the question from more than one?\n“If he starts anything or does anything Max will punch his fucking lights out.” Anna said\n“He certainly has the shoulders and arm muscle, can he take care of himself?” asked Robin.\n“Take care” was the Schmitt chorused reply. “Fuck yeah, said Willie. A bloke at one of our surf carnivals said something nasty about the girls. Max told him to keep it clean, this bloke had two mates, big units, Max cleaned up all three of them, and two went to the hospital. Police were called charges laid.”\n“Max” said Robin.\n“No, the other three dickheads, after Max told the coppers what they said, one of the coppers daughters was in Max’s squad, poor bastards” finished Willie laughing.\nAnna added, “Max served his Electrical Trade Apprenticeship in the Mining areas of Central Australia, it was a tough school, apparently, he’s a pretty closed book is our Max. Doesn’t say a lot, reads all the time, asks questions and listens to the answers, knows a shitload of stuff, you see in the early days of the Mining Industry out West It was a real mixed bag. A lot of foreign workers, Poles, Germans, Italians, and the Yanks, you name any country, it was probably represented”.\n“That’s why he gets on well with everybody, he was a jack of all trades did blasting, drove trucks, graders, excavators, geological surveying, Max did it all, you had to sleep out in the field make do. He made a lot of money, buying and selling all sorts of stuff, beer cigarettes you name it.”\n“Girls” chorused Inga and Veronica.\n“No, but I will sell you two if you don’t give me hand to get these platters out, take these I’ll get the wine, White or red ladies?”\n“White please” answered Robin \u0026 Helena.\n“What about you Willie, care to join us Girls”, asked Anna.\n“Yes Willie, get your Willy over here” laughed Inga, the rest joined in laughing.\n“Behave Miss,” said Anna.\n“Or I’ll tell Max, my Fianc� if you do not Mind Mother” Inga replied plum in the mouth.\n“Our Fianc� You greedy Cow” said Veronica.\n“God how weird does that sound,” Robin added as they all once again, started laughing.\n“Willie. Yes. Or No?” Anna asked.\n“Poor Little Willies sulking, poor baby” said Inga.\n“I’ll poor baby you,” said Willie. Willie like his Dad did not know when to keep quiet.\nInga and Helena launched the initial assault, Veronica and Robin followed it up, and Anna finished it, Willie naked, grabbed by 5 women tickling him, sucking on his nipples.\nInga looked at Veronica. Veronica went down, latching onto Willies Willy, sucking like a Demon.\nWillie was hard in no time. Veronica was just about to hop on to it. When Anna said, “We wouldn’t want any accidents now, would we ladies” as she lowered herself onto her son’s prick and proceeded to fuck him senseless.\nRobin sat on his face as the other girls sucked his balls, and stuck tongues and fingers up into his arse. Willie having realized what he was in for, proceeded to give as good as he got attacked Robin’s clit and labia with gusto. He soon had her screaming wreck, and she rolled off, onto her back.\nInga attached herself to Robins Inflamed and swollen clit “Sexually molest my brother bitch, cop this” sucking and chewing, and soon had Robin writhing and screaming for mercy.\nWillie flooded his mother’s cunt with his cream, as Anna rolled off onto her back Helena cleaned up his prick, as Veronica cleaned out the dripping cum from Anna’s sodden pussy.\nAs calm was restored Anna looked at Willie kissed him tenderly, “are you OK?” Anna asked.\nWillie smiled as he kissed his mother,\" Dad sure is one lucky old SOB\".\n“Don’t be rude to my Husband, you little shit”, she said as she bit the head of his prick laughing. Willie begged for mercy as they all sat up to have a snack.\n“Do you girls want some sausage?” Anna Asked.\n“Yea Willie how about some sausage” his sisters chorused.\n“Behave yourself” Anna said “and sit down” as she bought out a 12’’ long 6\" round German Salami.\n“I wonder how Max is going” Anna added, Picking up the salami, and a knife.\n“You Mean Brian” Veronica deadpanned.\n“No way” yelled Inga.\n“Yes fucking way, really” said Veronica.\n“OMG” Inga giggled.\n“He would need it with Stephanie”, Anna said “Shit sorry, did I say that out loud, don’t repeat that please, and don’t swear you two.”\nRobin looked at Veronica “really is it that big?”\n“Maybe, that is little thicker Mum”.\n“God no wonder Maxie calls Stephanie the hole” she blushed while looking at Anna and laughing.\n“Now you know why he wanted us to help him and Stephanie tries to make a baby, he didn’t want to fall in”.\n“Lauren told me the first time he turned up to make a baby, he had a length of 4x2 he said was to go across his arse in case he fell in” Veronica finished to hysterical laughter all round.\n“That’s our Max said Anna, God he is such a funny bugger he is totally outrageous, I don’t know how he gets away with it, I really don’t.”\n“I do” replied Robin After talking to people who have known him for years, anybody who has a problem or dramas Max is first there to help, no fuss no press, just helps out and goes on his Merry way.\"\n“He’s a lecherous old goat, but we all love him”, Anna replied giggling.\n“Why would Stephanie need Max to have more babies?” said Robin.\n“Brian Had cancer, and had both testicles taken out” replied Anna.\nRobin had tears in her eyes, “Sorry” she said.\n“Don’t be silly, you didn’t know” said Anna, giving her a hug.\n“Mum loves massive dicks,” Veronica added helpfully.\n“Veronica” Robin screeched in laughter.\n“Well you do, don’t deny it, R was hung like a plough horse, well you said you missed, being fucked by a monster dick”.\n“Well we’ve got Willie he’s the biggest dick I know,” said Inga helpfully, at poor Willies expense.\n“R did you say said Inga who’s R”\n“Raymond Edward Curtis the Third” said Robin aka as RC3\".\n“OMG you mean RC3 the rapper, you know RC3 said Inga OMG.”\n“Mum was married to RC3,” she said with that smirk that says shove that up your jumper.\n“Bullshit” said Inga.\nHelena added ever so helpfully “now we know why Max wanted Robin, Mum, to keep the kids at Bay” In an instant, becoming the target of, thrown insults, as well as thrown bread.\n“Behave you lot” said Anna laughing.\n“Really” said Robin. “For nearly Six years, 2 kids as well. Tommy who is nearly 13 and Shawna who is just turned 11”. “God what a life,” she said smiling shaking her head.\n“It must have been exciting”, said Inga.\n“Yea it was I suppose, at first when he was starting out, it turned into a soap opera though. He’s got three quarters of his family leeching of him bleeding him dry, poor bugger he doesn’t have a clue?”\n“What do you mean?” said Anna.\n“He hasn’t had a hit in ages, he’s bought a ton of stuff for his Family, and they still want more, I had had enough. I told him he should cut back on what he was spending, he went ballistic, I filed for Divorce, got my payout, and came back to Melbourne.” said Robin.\n“Why did you move up here?” asked Anna.\n“Bad Business decisions and unhealthy relationships, once they found out I was married to RC, it was can you do this, can you show him this song. I invested the rest, got a diploma in Marketing and Business and her we are”, she said smiling.\n“The only two of his family worth a dam are his stepsister Yolanda and Darryl his cousin or “Big D” or just D.”\n“Why big D, said Inga has he got a really big you know what?” she asked giggling.\n“Yea he has actually, but he’s just BIG, 6’ 7’’ tall and about 300 pounds what’s that about 160kg. And not a lot of it fat either.”\n“Jesus, he would eat more than Inga, said Willie, no probably not,” he laughed as they threw more food.\n“I hope you lot are going to pick that up” said Anna, laughing along.\n“Mum” said Veronica quietly from the end of the table once the laughter died down.\n“Yes Darling” she answered.\n“Who’s Grant Whitney, and why didn’t you tell me before?” She asked.\nThe room went quiet Robin beckoned her up to sit on her lap, kissed her cheek and started by saying.“Think of the worst person you could imagine knowing, and that the person giving you the best present, ever?”\n“What present did he give you mum?” Veronica asked.\n“You, my gorgeous girl” Robin answered giving her a hug.\n“Why, what did he do, Mum?” Veronica asked, trying to fill in the missing pieces of her father.\n“I will discuss this with you and Max as well Darling. I won’t go into details here, but I will say this, It started out OK and he got involved in dealing drugs and he got me involved as well, and I did something’s I’m not proud of”.\n“I tried to leave a couple of times”. Robin sighed, as she looked at the other faces. “It’s not that easy to see what someone’s like when you are in a fishbowl with them, he’s dead which I am glad to say is a good thing. I mean that baby, because to hurt me for leaving, he would have hurt you, he had turned that bad. He was well raised, well educated, his Fathers dead and his Mother your Grandmother, still live in Melbourne in Toorak, and she’s Lady Francis Whitney?” Looking over at Anna, who had lived in Melbourne?\nAnna mouthed “Shit.”\n“Ah huh said Robin, Shit”.\n“So there you go my sweet kissing and hugging her, now some of the puzzle is complete”.\n“Can I meet her?”\n“I don’t see why not I will talk it over with Max and we will work it out, OK.” Robin replied.\nVeronica started to bristle. Robin said, “Don’t get mad at me Miss I’m your Mother irrespective of whom we are marrying. Max will want to do what’s right for you, because the last time I took you to see her, she threw me out of the house onto the street, OK, and it’s not something I want you, to have to deal with without support?”\n“OK Mum sorry”, said Veronica giving Robin a massive hug.\n“And besides Missy Moo, what’s the deal with you and Charlie Dog, young Lady?” she asked as Veronica went Crimson to her toenails as she remembered what had occurred.\n“Maybe later OK Mum she said trying to get out of explaining.\nWhich only got a chorus of “Bullshit, You’re a real Bitch” said Inga laughing her head off. “Tell us please tell us,” Inga and Helena whined.\nVeronica looked at each in turn and said, “You have to swear this stays only within the Family OK” “We swear, we swear,” they all chorused including Anna.\nVeronica looked over at Willie who was humming who let the dogs out. “Willie I want your word, Not a Fucking Peep, OK or I will drop you in the shit, with Max, OK”\n“I didn’t do anything,” he said smiling.\n“I know I will make something up OK” as the smile disappeared from Willies face.\n“That’s not fair?” said Anna.\n“I know said Veronica, but it worked, walking over and kissing Willie, I wouldn’t do that to you. You Mother Fucker” which as one imagined caused hysterical laughter to erupt.\n“I seem recall you doing some mother fucking of your own,” said Inga, as the laughter died down.\n“You’re confused dear, I’m a Mother Licker” she replied hugging Anna.\n“Me too” said Inga hugging Robin.\n“OK said Robin, Charlie Dog and it had better be a short story as our boys should be back shortly, and Max will want that info.”\nVeronica launched into what had happened and the result of it all as she finished Inga looked a Robin and smiled. “We are SO getting another Dog, don’t you think Robin?”\nRobin looked at Anna and laughed shaking her head. “To think yesterday my Major decision was whether to buy more beans or sprouts.”\n“Beans the rest said.\n“Now Its Dogs, global finance, heaven know what’s next” she smiled shaking her head.\n“Oh said Veronica did you get that Promotion you went for”.\n“No” said Robin, “Graham the produce buyer thought I wasn’t ready for that much responsibility the bastard.”\nAh well said Anna “you won’t have worry about that any more will you?”\n“Shit I hadn’t thought of that.”\n“Before either of you say a word, school is still ongoing for you both.”\n“It’s just not fair said Inga to Veronica, I get married, and I still get bossed around.”\n“Let’s get this info for our Man, Ladies”, Robin said giving them both a hug and a kiss.\n“When we finish can I lick you out again, you taste really yummy?” Inga inquired.\n“Inga” her mother squealed.\n“What, it’s, a perfectly valid Question, I don’t think Max is going to be 100% for a day or two, and I’m Horny”\nAnna \u0026 Robin looked at each other. “Yea she’s Right said Robin, how is Max going to cope with us all, we will kill the poor Bugger.”\n“If it were me, said Willie. I would bring in reinforcements, to help out when needed”.\n“I wonder If Stephanie would lease out Brian, for Mum to get her Big Dick Fix”, Veronica said to Inga.\n“We could always ask Stephanie,” said Inga before Robin could go off; they promptly fell about Laughing on the sofa.\nAnna Looked at Robin and said “That’s a fantastic idea Girls well done”\nRobin replied “Works for me Ill run that by Maxie, Thanks Girls” giving Anna a Wink.\nAnna started the Fire as it was starting to get a bit Chilly. Moreover, they all got down to preparing their reports for Max.\nAs Klaus and I were just about off the MacKinnon’s driveway, I asked Klaus “you reckon it’s too late to Drop into Barneys Place?”\nKlaus looked at the clock, “yeah he will be loaded for sure by now poor bastard”.\nBarney Reynolds had taken the death of his wife Michelle, and his two boys Bradley and Cameron, extremely hard. Michelle and the boys coming back from Rugby match. When a truck, coming the other direction. Had a blown Tyre and killed them all instantly. The court case was still ongoing.\nBarney had stayed home to look after Allison, who had the flu. Barney had symptoms as well. They decided that Michelle would go and take the boys and stay overnight, as it was a four-hour drive back home, late on a winter’s day.\nBeing concerned at the condition of Barney and Allison they decided after a bit of cajoling from Barney that they would come home to look after them.\nThe accident occurred 40 minutes from home on the main highway. Guilt is a funny thing Barney who had seemed so brave and stoic. He had been in the army a genuine war hero Warrant Office Barnabas Reynolds, Medal of Gallantry, Silver Star and Bar, Mentioned in Dispatches.\nHe had been a forward Recon observer in Afghanistan when he noticed a group of Taliban about to Ambush Two Platoons of US Marines, opened Fire Killing 5 or six of the enemy and been wounded when they had attacked him from above.\nHe had ordered a close air strike in direct opposition from his superiors saving his own and the Americans lives and promptly putting a 24-year career down the toilet.\nApparently telling a Colonel to go Fuck Himself, and to go and sell fried chicken is not a done thing. Michelle was Deputy Principle at the Local primary school; Barney had gone back to Uni obtaining a Degree in Logistics Management. His moving shit on a Truck Degree he called it.\nLife had been fantastic, nice house, lovely wife great kids and a great Life. It had all gone to shit after Michelle and the boys deaths. Barney liked a drink, and he took to it energetically. He was trying to find peace, in the bottom of a bottle of whisky. Hastings did not have a Village Drunk; Barney was the successful applicant for that position.\nAllison now nearly 16 went the other way. If it walked, and talked and had two legs and a penis Allison had probably fucked it or combination of him his mates, who knew. She had applied to be the Village slut; she won the job when she fucked a visiting football team, or so the story went.\nWe had helped when we could some more than others did and some giving up. I can be a stubborn shit so I was still fighting the good fight so to speak. Allison had been an outstanding swimmer and competitor I had pitted her against Inga it had worked well, up until her Mother and her brothers died.\nShe had gone, come back, and gone away again. Pretty, 5’ 6”’ tall, Dark Reddy Brown, curly hair, green eyes, nice figure, good tits a terrific kid. It broke my heart to see them like this.\nWe had started on the road back to Klaus’s house when half mile from Barneys turn off a silver Nissan GTR with no lights on nearly ran into us head on, “Fucking bastard did you get his number Klaus” as I looked in the mirror to see if I could get the number plate. I said.\n“Brake” Klaus screamed grabbing the wheel and turning it towards the embankment. I braked hard. I heard a thud, front panel right hand side. Looking out I could see a body laying on the road it was a young girl. Hazards flashing, I opened the door and stepped out, it was Allison Reynolds.\n“It is Allie Klaus”, I said looking at her covered in dirt blood and cum. I lifted her dress up to look at her thighs, she was a mass of dried blood, semen, and god knows what else.\nI grabbed the waterproof blanket from the back wrapped her up and put her into the back seat It looked as if she had been fucked by the seventh fleet.\nKlaus got in to hold her as I sped down the road towards Klaus house to get Anna to have a look at her. Anna had a nursing degree and was our First aid officer when we had training and surf carnivals.\nKlaus said “I got a Partial Number from the car BB and LF” I looked at him as we turned into drive, “Troy Wolfe” I said BBDWLF “Big Bad Wolf” well I was going wolf hunting I needed a Rug.\nI turned the car around grabbing my mobile.\nI ran into the house and yelled “Anna First aid Kit, Back seat Allison Reynolds Now Move”.\nI Pressed call “Get me the, Duty Watch Commander Now, its Councillor Max Adams?”\n“I am sorry he’s unavailable”, was the answer I received.\n“Wake him up before I ring the Local paper and have half the fucking district coppers arrested, I know where all the skeletons are buried, now Fucking Get Him”\nYes Sir.\n“Sgt Edward Stanley, this had better be seriously fucking urgent.” Was what I got in reply?\n“Max Adams Stan I have Allison Reynolds In the back seat of my Car” I said.\n“Lucky you” he said.\n“If you want to join that at other cunt swimming at the 40 fathoms stay on that track”. “Wait one Ed”\nAnna walked up saying “she looks as if she has assaulted front and back there is bruising on her thighs, and a bruise on her hip?”\n“Take her to the district hospital 50 mins away. Or the local private” I asked.\n“They don’t take emergencies”, said Anna.\n“Want to bet”. I said.\n“Ed sorry about that” Allison looks as she’s been sexually assaulted I’m taking her into to Local Private get a Woman PC and a patrol car to meet me there. I know who did it?”\n“Who,” he said.\n“It was Troy Wolfe he nearly cleaned Klaus and I up coming home from Alex’s Place. It was silver Nisan GTR partial BB LF, on a personal plate, heading back towards Town?”\n“Fuck” he said his family are heavy hitters\". Troy was the Grandson of Lionel Wolfe Trucking Magnate and Billionaire. Troy’s father Garry was worth net about $600 million in his own right.\n“That’s OK Ed I have gone up a few points in the rankings I now outweigh both of them”.\n“What, he said.\n“Ed Gary Wolfe’s worth what about 600 mill give or take” I said. I added Ed, got a calculator.\n“Yes Why?” he asked.\nDivide 600 into 20,000.\n“Whose 20,000?” he asked.\n“That’s me Ed.”\n“That 20, it can’t be a B can it, Fuck”, he said sounding stunned.\n“Yep.”\n“Shit, you have gone up, Not the Money Pit,” he enquired.\n“Yep the pit.”\n“You always were a lucky bastard. How serious is Allison?” he asked getting down to business.\n“Bad mate they went front and back and tore her to pieces”.\n“Shit no wonder your upset”, Ed replied.\n“OK got to go Anna’s calling, hope there is no radar on the way in.\n“I will send another car to escort you hope they can keep up” I could hear him talking in the background, “they will meet you there Max”.\n“Thanks Ed.”\n“No worries Max, I won’t need my Bathers will I?” he asked.\n“No mate it’s all OK.”\n“Ed a favour, I said as I walked to the car, Minimal paperwork low key of the Radar, reputations.”\n“I understand last thing we need is more publicity, the Wolfe’s will appreciate that I’m sure” he said.\n“Fuck the Wolfe’s I was thinking of Allison, Whoever’s involved bring their parents to the hospital as well, Ed, Got to Go Bye”\nAnna had checked her vitals and left her wrapped in the blanket. She had strapped Allison into the seat and was holding here in position.\n“Klaus.”\n“Yea Max.”\n“Get Barney whatever condition Bring him in as well, Take Willie.”\n“Why?” Klaus asked.\n“Because when he finds out what the Bastards have done to Allison he will kill them all.”\n“You think so Max,” he enquired.\n“What would you do if they did that to Inga” He just nodded.\nI looked over at my Girls “you girls take care I said I m staying with Alison OK Love you guys”.\n“Bye, Max”. They said kissing me.\nI now hold the fasted time from the Five mile to the Hasting Private.\nAll Anna said, “Fuck this thing can go.”\nI laughed “I’ll buy, you one OK”\n“You’re on”. She replied laughing.\nI pulled up at the hospital foyer and pushed on the bell hard it kept ringing, a badly dressed overweight woman with a sour look said “you’ll have to go to the public hospital we don’t take Emergency Patients”.\n“You do now because if you don’t, I’ll drive this car through this door,” I told her.\n“I am calling the Police,” she said.\nThe police pulled up.\n“This man has threatened to drive his car through the door.”\nThe Senior Constable looked at me, and looked at her, “Well you had better open the door then or he will do it”, the door opened, and Allison was carried into the hospital.\nNurses came from all directions, and placed Allison on a Gurney, a Female Doctor in a suit was just leaving as we entered “Can you have a Look at her for us, please?” I asked.\n“I’m not an Emergency Doctor,” she said.\nI looked at old cranky face and said “any other Doctors?”\n“No”\n“Well Doc, you volunteered”.\n“But I’m”\nI just said to her “If you don’t attend to her after they have taken the necessary swabs etc. for forensics you won’t need to worry about being a doctor?”\n“Why”, she replied.\n“Because I’ll get 10 kids to tell you sexually abused them in the surgery.”\n“You would not” she angrily replied.\n“Want to take the risk, your choice”. I replied.\n“Who are you?” she asked.\n“Doc I’m your best Friend, or your worst Nightmare, You Pick.”\nI could see old cranky face Making a phone call, and looking in my Direction.\n“Who’s that?” I asked one of the other nurses.\n“She is related somehow to the owners, the Morgan group.”\n“How is this place going?” I asked.\nShe said quietly “it’s for sale, its losing money hand over fist”\n“Why”, I asked.\n“It is not large enough” was the answer I received.\n“I thought it was going OK,” I said.\n“The council will not let us expand, and the new state school is going where we were going to go.”\n“Oh, I had voted against that decision at my first meeting. I told that to the Nurse.\nShe said I know, I am in your District,\n“Did you vote for me?” I asked her smiling.\nYes, she said.\n“Good what is your Name?”\nJanet Walkom, she said.\nJust then, Klaus turned up with Barney he was � loaded but still sought of OK. Cranky face came up. She was just as she was about to say something.\nI held my hand and said to Barney “Allison’s had a bit of an accident nothing Major she’s been Taken Care of Mate Ill look after her. You get some rest, and I’ll see you in the Morning”.\nThey took him away towards the room. “Just you wait here a moment you cannot come in here and just take over” she said sounding upset.\nI looked at her face and smiled looked at her staff Badge Clara Madjakowski. Admissions Manager, “Clara that mans daughter has been sexually assaulted, by some sons of some extremely wealthy individuals?”\n“Garry Wolfe is one of them”, she went pale “yep, and Allison’s farther is a drunk only because his wife and 2 boys were killed in a car accident. With me so far, he is a decorated war hero”.\n“He was awarded, if you will excuse the French, a shit load of medals for killing a whole heap of Taliban? Now what do you think he is going to do when he wakes up. I will get ugly real quick don’t you agree?”\nShe nodded in tears, “Give me a hug you big softy” I said, “your all bark and no bite I bet”. I hugged her.\n“Sometimes I bite”, she replied smiling.\n“Ouch” I laughed and kissed her cheek, and she smiled.“Let’s see how the patient is going”.\nWe walked into the room as the Female officer was finishing “How is she?” I asked the Doctor and WSC.\n“She is going to need stitches at the front. And her anal cavity is quite badly bruised; I have taken swabs and forensic evidence as well” there was brown paper bags all over the bed. “Plus I took 40 Photos”.\nI looked at Clara “can you copy and print them off here?” I asked.\n“Are they on a card?” Clara asked.\n“Yes” was the answer.\nThe SC said, “That will break the chain of evidence; It could affect the trial,”\n“There is not going to be a trial they would crucify her in court?” I answered.\n“Biggest you can get, full colour please Clara.”\nThe Doctor turned to us. Clara was hurrying, to get the prints.\n“How in heavens name did you do that”, she asked, as, Anna stood and watched.\n“Did you ever watch Crocodile Dundee One?” I asked.\nYes, they all nodded.\n“Remember that scene, with the water buffalo”, I answered and smiled. They all bit their tongues, to stop laughing.\n“Max, you are so cruel, but god that was so funny,” said Anna.\n“Your Max Adams” said the Doctor.\n“The one and only, and what have I done now?” I asked.\nShe kissed me on the cheek, “tried to save this Hospital is all” she said.\n“Looks like I wasn’t successful its being sold mores the pity”. I added.\n“Sorry Max, Doctor Emma Wilson” she said.\n“Wilson, You’re not Charlie Wilsons Misses are you?”\n“I was.”\n“What happened?” I asked.\n“He passed away Heart Disease.”\n“Sorry to hear that, Old No mess, was a close friend of mine”.\n“No what” she said.\n“There was an ad on TV “No mess, Charlie the Plumber” It sought of stuck, I said. “Charlie told me had met a good-looking girl in Sydney”, Charlie’s father had owned a plumbing business.\n“Now what brings you back up here, I asked her.\n“His parents and my 2 Kids?” she replied.\nShe was just about to say something, when the nurse said “she’s ready to be stitched Doctor”.\n“How is she going?” I asked.\n“She should be Ok with rest once I get theses stitches in,” said the doctor, looking worried.\n“I can’t stitch worth a dam,” said the Doc Emma.\n“That’s OK I can, Ill fix her up lets go”.\nYou can well imagine the looks that got, we cannot let you do that Public Liability etc, etc. I walked in, and Allison was awake lying on the bed legs apart all on display.\n“Hi Ally Cat, how are you going sweetheart”, as I bent down kissed her.\n“What happened to me, I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck?”\n“Ah” I said looking at them all, “a Range Rover that was me”.\n“How” asked Ally.\n“You bloody walked out in front of me you goose”. I said laughing.\n“Doctor the local is wearing off” said the nurse sounding anxious.\n“Hey Allison the Doc Cant stitch for crap, want me to have a go at it, you need about half a dozen or so, OK”?\n“I did a pretty fair job on your eyebrow remember”. Ally, hit by a surfboard and had needed three stitches to close it up.\n“Yea OK Max” she said.\n“You want to hear something funny Ally, besides your Dad, I’m most likely the only bloke not to have seen your pussy lately” I said laughing.\n“Stop making me laugh it hurts?” Allison replied giggling.\n“What I can’t hear there’s an echo”, I replied as I washed my hands to put on my gloves, “Ally one plank or two?” I asked looking around her leg.\n“What?” She asked me.\n“One plank or two, across their arse to stop falling in”, the Doctor and the other Nurses did not know where to look to try and not laugh. “OK Doc, watch, and learn”, I Picked up the needle, and said, “It is just a small prick”.\nAlly said, “that’s not what I’ve been told.” as laughter erupted from the room.\nI stitched her up, as I had put in the last stitch, and tied it off. I said to “Ally good to go for another 20 Thousand OK Kiddo. Want to have a look?” “Got a Mirror handy,” I said to the Doctor. “You see where I tied it of it holds the others tight”.\n“What’s going on in here?” said a voice behind my back.\n“Fanny stitching 101” I said.\nAllison put her legs down as I held the Mirror for her to see the result “I asked what was going on,” he said. Clara had bought the pictures back they were horrible, but just what I wanted.\n“This” I said showing him the pictures”.\n“We don’t do admissions,” he said,\n“You do now,” I said winking at Clara.\n“Who are you and what are you doing in my Hospital?”\n“Your Hospital how much do you want for it. I asked.”\n“I am calling the police,” he said.\n“Don’t bother,” said the senior we are already here”.\n“I want this Man arrested at once,” he said looking at the officer.\nI just looked at the officer, said, “How many children did he sexually abuse then, was it 6 or 7”, and looked on as the blood drained from his face. “Doctor whoever sit down and shut up OK”. I said pointing to a chair outside. “Thank you.”\n“How’s that look Ally like new?”\n“Wow, it looks tiny” she replied.\n“We’ll keep it that way, Your Dads in the other room get some sleep I’ll see you later on I’m staying here OK” I Gave her a kiss Love you Kiddo. Now sleep”.\n“Sorry Doctor, Councillor Max Adams” I said introducing myself.\nHe looked at the photos shaking his head, “how could they do that”\n“Because they can, and think they can get away with it”. I said\n“Doctor Ian Redman” he replied shaking my hand.\n“Sorry for being such an arse in there, I know her family, and I love that Girl, she’s a sweetheart”.\nJust then, two police cars and three other cars pulled up out the Front.\n“Is there somewhere Private I can have a chat to these parents and their kids”.\n“Yes there, the board room” he answered pointing down the hall.\n“Thank you Doctor You Lot follow after me now!”\nThe police ushered them in to the Boardroom “What’s Going on?” Kate Wolfe. Garry’s wife asked.\nI ignored her. “How are you Garry?” I said.\n“Not bad” he replied.\nAs Kate asked yet again “what’s going on?”\n“Garry, put a muzzle on that bitch before I superglue her face to her cunt”.\nShe was just about to go off when the Sgt who had Just walked In “I’d Sit Down, shut up, or Ill Help him Do It. Now Sit”.\n“That’s what’s been going on,” I said as I showed them the photos, the men went white, and two of the mothers were physically sick, into garbage bins outside.\n“You girls get cleaned up, well sought this out man to man” Garry glared at Kate, Kate went.\n“Ok it’s like this there is a truckload of evidence your boys have been placed at the scene, She is Under 16, So whether consent was granted or not they will all be charged with having sex with a minor, Probably put on a data base, criminal conviction no government work, you get the picture”.\n“But she’s a slut” one of the boys smirked.\n“Yes she is you didn’t need to hurt her, and if you interrupt me again Ill dump you off over the 40 Fathom Drop off where that other child molesting cunt went your call”.\n“What about the Police?” said one of the fathers?\n“Who do you think owned the fucking boat?” I answered.\n“Right this stops here Now, What I want from each of you is Half a million Dollars, that’s Right you heard correctly. “Five hundred Thousand Each By close of business tomorrow, say 5.00pm”.\n“I can’t get that sought of Money” they replied.\n“Gary can get it from his Father”.\n“Or this is what’s going to happen this story will be on the front page of every major Paper, web sites, international, and I will use all of My 20 Billion Dollars, That’s right 20 Billion, to turn your lives and the lives of all your Family into a smoking fucking ruin”.\n“You can’t do that” was the chorused reply.\n“It’s either that or you will all be dead within the week, why you ask?”\n“Ed what did Allison’s father Barney, Do before he became town drunk?”\n“Easy Max He was paid by the government to kill people.”\n“Any good at it” I asked.\n“Fuck yea gave him a shit load of Medals”, he replied as they all went white.\n“So call it life insurance, you’re Life Insurance and if he doesn’t succeed I will get people to help OK?”\n“And you four, I said looking at the boys. “This all got out of hand I’m guessing am I right?”\n“Yes Sir”.\n“I thought so you didn’t have to hurt Her If You wanted a dog and Pony show she would have bought the fucking dog”.\n“Why because three people who she loved most in the world her Mum and two little brothers were killed when a truck had a blowout pure dumb luck wrong place wrong time”. I know you guys are not bad OK,” I said pausing before continuing.\n“This is how it’s going to go down, you will apologise to Allison, whatever plans you have for the rest of the year, forget them Don’t care, not going to happen, you will be doing every shitty job that I and other people can find for you all from now until Christmas, no arguments, Non Negotiable”.\n“And Young Mr Wolfe, You my boy are going to marry my daughter Lauren, I’m her father, Brian is her dad. Not only did you break her Cherry you broke her heart so It’s about 25 to life for you, Oh I’ll be buggering your arse into next week and when I finish her Dad will be starting OK?” Troy just nodded.\n“Yes I know about you and Serena Taylor Not going to happen”. The women came back into the room.\n“Kate come here please”, I just gave her a kiss on the cheek and a hug “Sorry for being a shit?”\n“OK and this message, for all of you. You are not their fucking friends. You are their parents; if they want, love and Affection get them a dog. You think you lot have got Dramas I’ve got three women I’m to Marry, and I get to have this Muppet, Pointing at Troy as a son in law, I’ve got to tell Lauren she’s Getting married to Someone she’s been burning in Effigy for the past Month, Care to swap?”\n“We all happy, OK Ill see how the patients going”. I was just about to leave the room when Garry asked.\n“Max when was that truck accident, with her Mother?” he asked.\n“About two months before Lizzy was killed mid 2009,” I said.\n“Shit I could have been one of mine, or dads, I will look into it?” a note of concern in his voice.\n“You all might think I’m being dramatic, but no one wins with this type of crap, No Body, Not Allison. Not You Guys, Not the Town, Especially the Town, that’s all we need headlines “Billionaires Son in Child Rape” That will read well down south don’t you agree?”\n“Hang I’ll get some, Coffee” as Clara bought coffee into the room for all, “I’ll go and check on the patient?” I walked down to see Allison, as Glen was talking on the Phone.\n“How are you Kiddo ready to see the Mongol hoard?” I said laughing at her.\n“Yea” she said, will you stay with me?”\n“All the girls say that”, I said smiling.”\n“I’ve given her a mild sedative to help ease the pain,” said Emma.\n“Thanks Doc You Go home and get some rest as well” Emma said, “She’s pretty special isn’t she?”\n“You should have seen her Mum, Smart, Funny Pretty; she met Barney that was it. He was worried that she was much smarter than he was I said “Barney, that just Proves how smart you are for knowing that”.\n“You know why Doc, the sexiest part of a woman’s anatomy isn’t between her legs it’s between her ears”.\nShe kissed me on the cheek “you are just too smooth.”\n“Ah Doc play fair, your breaking my Heart.”\n“Clara Thinks you’re pretty special”, she said.\n“What’s she like as an administrator?” I asked Emma.\n“Fantastic not a lot of personality” said Emma.\n“I need a personal assistant who I feel safe around, and my girls Like” I said.\nEmma asked “Your Daughters?”\n“No my wives” I said.\nShe shook her head “Dare I ask?”\n“I’ve got three for the moment,” I said.\n“How are you going to manage that?” asked Emma.\n“Ah said I that is, the problem. I need to look into that”.\n“You ready Ally?” I asked her.\n“Send them one at a time, please, Max” she replied.\n“Thank you Clara, let em in.”\nAs they trooped in one after the other, Allison being, Ally forgave them and gave them each a kiss. Troy was last in, as his father and mother watched on, Allison had beckoned him over, as he bent down, she grabbed hold of his balls and squeezed. Hard, as tears formed in his eyes she relaxed her grip a little, and said, “You had better look after Lauren OK” and squeezed them again.\n“OK” he just managed to squeak.\nShe pulled him over and kissed him on the cheek again saying, “Once I’m better if Laurens up for a threesome, I’m good to go, OK”\n“What, she said I’m not going to become a nun, now piss of and let me get some sleep”.\n“That’s my Ally Cat,” I said, looking at the others.\n‘We had better let her get some rest said Emma” shaking her head as she closed the door. “She’s unbelievable,” she muttered shaking her head.\n“It runs in the family,” I said.\n“When they finally got her father to hospital after the fight he had 4 bullets in him, plus shell fragments from the bombs, he’ s as tough as old Boots and she’s like her Dad,” I said.\n“What the enemy bombed him?” said Garry.\n“No he called in an air strike, Danger Close, say from here to the other side of the foyer entry” I said a distance of about 50 meters.\nI had my arm around Clara as Garry said, “That’s just Fucking Insane!”\n“You Think, his reason was If he was going to go those Bastards were going with him, you know what he said to the Forward Air Controller.”\n“What” said Garry?\n“If you fuck this up, I’ll come back and fucking haunt you” as we all burst in to laughter.\nAlly called out “Piss of you lot I’m trying to go to sleep.”\n“Sorry Kiddo” as we moved away, I looked at the Wolfe’s, “that’s who you are dealing with Garry you really want to fuck with that?”\n“That would be a No” he said, Karen and Troy just shook their head. I looked at my watch 11.15pm. “Go on you lot Bugger of, Clara and I have work to Do”, I said looking at Troy “How’s the Nuts Buddy need the Doc to have a look.”\n“I’m all right thanks Mr Adams.”\n“Good Lad” I said.\n“Max I’ve talked to Dad, and he’s going to see what he came come up with for Allison, I sent him some of photos of Ally.”\n“Not Happy” I asked.\n“You have no idea, Ballistic” he replied.\n“Good, It deserved Ballistic, hopefully it will be all sorted tomorrow,” I said.\n“What about Mr Reynolds said Doctor Emma, does he require anything?”\n“Sure does Doc he needs a reason not to get shitfaced every day; he needs somebody who’s smart, caring, really pretty, with a couple of Kids” I replied looking at her.\n“Know anyone who fits the Bill?”\n“Me, he’s”. She muttered\nI answered before she could go on, “He’s what? I said, a drunk sure is, he never was before the accident. He hardly ever drank; we all need someone to love Doc. Especially if we have lost someone, Is it the same no, sometimes its better, who knows, I don’t?”\n“But” she said.\nI interrupted again “What your university educated, and he’s not. Michele his wife said to me one day “you know what Max that old man of mine is smarter than nearly all of my professors, at University. He’s read every classic Novel known to Man, least twice, he could go to University and do a Final exam no study and have degree tomorrow.”\nI looked at Garry “you’ve been out to Alex MacKinnon’s place haven’t you, How was it.”\n“God Max that place is Paradise,” he answered.\n“Well I will tell you this for free, and don’t tell Alex, not that it matters I’ve bought it, Barneys place make Alex’s look like the car park out there,” I said pointing out side.\n“How” said Garry.\n“It’s untouched never been worked on, nothing it’s pristine. It is the best place on the planet to raise a whole parcel of Kids.”\n“Wow” was all he said.\n“Yep, and I’m going to buy it from him. Why would he sell it, because I will own all the Five Mile Boyo lock stock and barrel and any developer who fucks with me had better bring an army, now bugger of, Clara and I have got work to do.”\n“Sleep on it for me Emma OK, Behave, and don’t talk to strangers, now go.”\nAs Clara and I walked away I heard Doc Emma say to Anna “Is he always like that?”\n“No, He is not quite 100%” Anna replied.\n“What is he sick?” she asked.\n“No it’s that my daughter and her Girlfriend and Mother fucked him senseless?”\n“You’re Kidding” said Kate looking at us.\n“And as for you Doc you had better snap up Barney before someone else grabs him” said Anna as Emma looked at me walking away.\n“He’s gotten to you hasn’t he?’ said Anna looking at Emma, who nodded.\n“He has that effect our Max does” Said Anna.\n“And as for you Miss” said Anna looking at Kate, “Give your husband his Balls Back, Clip numb nuts here behind the ear go home fuck each other stupid, and thank your lucky stars Max sorted this out, not Barney, Now Go” she said opening the door Kissing them all.\n“And you Troy Wolfe look after my goddaughter, or you, will go missing”. Anna closed the door.\nClara and I walked into her Office I sat on the other chair as she sat at her desk, “Before we start I have an apology to make to you”\nClara held up her hand for me to stop. “The water Buffalo?” she said.\nI just nodded, she got up came over and kissed me and said, “That comment, Max Adams is the fucking funniest thing I have ever heard in my life, don’t worry?”\n“But I do worry I would like you to work for me.”\n“In what capacity?” she asked.\n“My personal assistant and Go to person”, I answered.\n“Would this position involve you having sex with me?” said Clara.\nNow you are not going to believe this but I was lost for words, uncommon but true.\n“Max answer the girl why don’t you” said Anna leaning against the door, Looking on at my discomfort.\n“Would you want me to,” I said looking at them both.\n“Yes” Clara said Looking First at me then Anna.\n“But I’m not in love with you”, I said, appealing to Anna for Help, she just left me Hanging.\n“I know that?” said Clara, “Could you come in and close the door, please Anna”, as Anna closed the door. Clara started to speak “wait until I’ve Finished Max, before asking any Questions OK”, I nodded.\n“I’m Polish, and I’m Jewish said Clara, if we were an animal species we would be classed Endangered thanks to an Austrian House Painter called Hitler. Now this hospital is owned by the Morgan group, yes, and I am Sir Paul Morgan’s Niece, I own including this Hospital and Other assets about 30% of the company, I could Buy your big patch of Dirt, your share of 20 Billion, and still have more than 40% of my holdings”.\n“What you did for that girl and her family was the noblest thing I have ever seen in my Life, you would have spent it all to ruin them wouldn’t you. I nodded yes, thought so said Clara, now about me, my life is my work I buy I sell I make a little here, a little there it soon adds up. I have everything I need in my life except for two things, someone who loves me, and wants children. Max look at me I, am built for comfort, not for speed. So you want me, to work for you, why?”\n“So I do not fuck it up, this is a very different ball game, I feel like I did my First day at school”, I said.\n“What happened at school?” asked Clara.\n“I couldn’t find were to get my lunch, I got beaten up and I got lost walking home” I said.\n“You got into a fight on your first day at school.” Said Clara\n“No I got beaten up; I didn’t get into a fight.”\n“What happened?” said Clara looking at Anna shaking her head.\n“I stole Emily Jenkins Vegemite sandwich, and she belted me” Clara and Anna dissolved into hysterical laughter.\n“On your first day at school, you had the crap beaten out of you by a girl” said Clara trying hard not fall apart again.\n“What happened on the second day did she beat you up again?” asked Anna.\n“No she became my girlfriend up until she moved away, in fifth class”. I started laughing, and that sent Clara and Anna of, once again.\nClara looked at me “you are the strangest man I have ever met Max Black” I stood up and lifted Clara onto her desk pushing her skirt up past her Thighs exposing a Peacock Blue pair of French Knickers.\nI pulled them down of her bottom past her milky white thighs, which framed a thatch of thick black silken hair covering her cunt. Her mound rose higher, I ran my hand up the outer edge of her mound parting her outer flaps with my finger causing her to shudder, As I pushed my finger into her tight vaginal canal, she kissed me.\n“Be gentle”, she said, I knew why, I could feel her hymen within the reach of my index finger.\n“Do you want me to; Clara once it’s done there is no going back is there, you love me don’t you?” I asked her.\n“So much it hurts,” she said.\nI undid my drawstring and lowered my pants and underwear stepping out of them, as I rubbed the head of prick against her cunt. I could feel her juices, thick and creamy; coat the head at the entrance to her canal. I eased the head of my prick inside her opening, as her juices started to flow faster, “Ready my sweet Clara” and pushed I could feel her tense as her hands gripped my arms, as it parted and I was inside her.\nHer eyes filled with tears, I kissed her gently on her lips, her cheeks, and eyes as I built a steady rhythm, this was not the fast pace of youth this was the steady love of a lifetime. I now had nearly all my prick buried into her as she leant back I speared up against her womb. Her body started to tense as she came, I was keeping pace with her, she was thrusting back into me; she came, with that beautiful soft shudder of bliss. “You ready my darling?” I asked, looking at her beaming smile.\nAnna asked, “Are you OK?”\n“I think so” I backed out and picked up the stroke, Clara was coming again as with one final push I unloaded deep within her, coating the back recesses of her vaginal canal with my fresh, creamy cum. She came with one last shudder her breasts pressed against my chest. “I love you?” I said.\nHer eyes opened wide “you said”\nI stopped that question with a kiss, “Am I in love with you, no but that my Darling will grow through the years, I will treat you with Love, respect”.\n“All I ask from you in return is to love me back. As for children, I will have as many as you want to have my dear one. One thing with our kids though Clara they are going to one of two things remarkably good looking, or they are going to need a dowry the size of Everest, to get them a date”.\nI started laughing as I hugged her and held her to my chest, as we laughed together. You don’t mind sharing me do you?”\n“Max, she said kissing me hard, you are the same as Vegemite a little bit is good, too much not so appetizing”.\nAs we, both laughed again. Anna handed us a clean towel and washer. I wiped Clara’s Pussy and mound it had a red tinge. I inquired, “Do I need to mail this to your Uncle?” She hit me.\n“No but you will need to ring him in the morning, he is up early” she replied.\n“OK. I said?”\n“Stay there” I said as I wiped her thighs. I put my face and buried my tongue into her Pussy.\n“You don’t have to,” said Clara.\n“I want to” I said, as I started to lick through the thick matt of her hair I sucked on her clit, which was peeking out of the undergrowth. I sucked, nibbled, licked, and once again rewarded with Clara shuddering and cumming again. I licked her once more, and kissed her on the lips.\n“We will need to get the lawn trimmed my darling and get rid of those damn uniforms they are hideous; you didn’t pick them did you. God no wonder you guys just wear black all the time.” Even Anna laughed at that. The look when she saw the blood on the washer was priceless.\nClara she just glowed, her eyes sparkled her smile beamed out a mile wide, “You are beautiful, look at you” I said as I helped her up and put on her knickers.\nAs she saw herself in the mirror, she looked at me and said, “That’s you.”\nI asked, “Why, is that me?”\nClara just looked at Anna “he doesn’t have a clue does he?”\n“Nope” said Anna tidying up.\n“It’s just a reflection of you silly; you can’t stay unhappy, with you around Max”. Clara said.\n“Oh one thing Clara you called me Max Black no one’s called me that for ages.”\n“That’s what my Aunt called you when she told stories about you” Clara replied.\n“Your Aunt Lady Morgan I’ve never met her,” I said.\nClara replied saying, “You knew her as Margarita Zigaronski, Lady Paul Morgan Is Ziggys sister Margie”.\n“Oh shit, she was married to some Polish Mine engineer up in the Kimberly’s, they were having some major dramas, and she left him, taking her two boys. They stayed over with us”.\n“Max you didn’t?” said Anna.\n“Well she left him, and Ziggy was drunk and I was lonely and horny and, she was truly lovely, not pretty, just funny and smart, You Know me Anna, brain first, body second.”\nClara asked, “Did you love her?”\n“I thought so, which amounts to the same thing she was older, way smarter, when I woke up in the morning she had already gone?”\n“What happened said Anna, what did you say to her?”\n“That he was a fuckwit, and if he didn’t want her, Id marry her in a heartbeat, and I think it was her parents, wrong side of the tracks not good enough that sought of crap I don’t know what happened, she left and Ziggy went to work at another Mine.”\n“Do you want to know Max?” she said. I nodded.\n“Well Margie went back to where he was working, told him was a fuckwit, and gave him back his ring. and said she had found someone younger, and extremely smart, he told her how much he loved her, stayed married had 5 kids, still together, Oh if she has an argument with Paul she reminds him he was second choice” said Clara looking at Anna breaking up laughing.\nI was putting on my pants when the door opened “Oh sorry” said Doctor Redman.\n“What’s up Doc?” I asked “No problems I hope”.\n“No it’s all fine thank you,” he said.\n“Clara, do you have Professor Barnard Home phone number on file?” I asked.\n“Russel Barnard” said Doc Redman.”\n“I don’t know his first name Anna’s son does research at the Uni Why?” I asked it was now 11.50pm.\n“You’re not going to ring him this hour of the night surely, he won’t be happy,” said the Doctor.\n“Doc, if someone rang you at 12.00pm and said I’m going to give you $120 Million would you be unhappy.”\nThe Doctor looked stunned, “you’re going to give him $120 Million what for.”\n“For research Doctor, or Bingo, Tatts, whatever, Why?” I asked.\n“I worked with him, and he’s just going round in circles and besides he’s lost his Funding with the University,” he said sounding upset.\n“Ah your wrong Doctor It’s not that he’s lost, he just doesn’t know what to look for, I am going to steer him on the right track, besides who knows what he might find.”\n“Clara.”\n“Yes Darling.”\n“How much do you reckon I would need to build a state of the art research facility where the school is going?” I asked her.\n“With, or without, Nuclear Medicine?” she asked.\n“May as well have the lot,” I said.\n“I would Budget $150 million give or take $20 Million with cyclotrons as well” said Clara.\n“Yep I will have to buy Grammar and extend it, so if I run out of money in the mean time could you lend me some,” I said.\n“OK Max how about I give you $400 for a start,” she said with a chuckle.\n“That will do nicely Thank you sweetheart,” I said giving her a kiss.\n“Oh sorry Doctor Redman, Clara Madjakowski soon to be, Does Adams work for you darling?”\nClara Nodded.\nClara owns the hospital, and she’s the niece of Sir Paul and Lady Morgan, Oh and that’s not $400 dollars, Doc that’s $400 Million Dollars do you have Professor Redman’s Number, yes, brilliant I’ll ring him Now, Thankyou”\nDoctor Redman started to say, “I believe I owe you,”\nClara cut him off, “Its Fine Doctor Really we have all been under a great deal of stress”.\n“Now I believe My Fianc�”, she smiled as she looked at Anna. “You Doctor will be working with Professor Barnard.”\n“Who is going to run the Hospital?” he asked.\n“Anna” said Clara looking straight at Anna.\n“Me said Anna, why me?”\n“Well said Clara you get things done with typical German efficiency, the Staff like you, Max adores you, and anyone who Max adores can’t be that bad. Just don’t start putting people up chimneys, the pollution controls are horrendous.”\nAnna and Doctor Redman looked at Clara in Horror “I’m Jewish we say it its Funny, you say that It’s a Lawsuit” “Oh said Clara you sure Max is not Jewish, his sense of humour it so Black. I wonder?”\nProfessor Barnard was wide-awake, his wife Jenny had made a cup of tea for them, and I was bouncing ideas from my head at the Professor.\n“So you believe that Cancer cells are already in your body all the Time,” he said sounding indignant.\n“Yep.”\n“But that’s absurd”. He said.\n“Well then, where do they come from?” I asked.\n“They mutate from healthy cells”, yes point taken.\n“Then why some cells do becomes cancerous, and the same type of cell doesn’t. It never made sense to me,” I said.\n“What didn’t make sense?” said the Professor.\n“Normal cells one minute you’re all OK; next they turn into cancer cells, it just doesn’t make any sense,” I said.\nThe professor went quite “Russell it’s sought of like the early humans. Homo Habilis to Modern man It was once thought they evolved separately from each other wasn’t it?” I asked.\n“Yes that’s correct” he replied.\n“Now in the last 5 years or so with the advances in genetics, the general theory is they all evolved together intermingling genes?” I asked.\n“Yes’ he replied.\n“That turned that initial theory on its head, you had some involvement with that didn’t you,” I asked.\n“Yes I played a part in that yes.” He replied smugly.\n“Well I knew that first theory was wrong, at age 9,” I said.\n‘You knew that first theory was wrong at age 9. How in heavens name could you have known that?” he replied sounding upset.\n“It just never made sense to me Russell, Neanderthal Guy Sees Cro-Magnon Girl, You get the picture, I said as much to the teacher, and got thrown out of class” I replied.\n“But how, why” he said stuttering.\n“I have what you might call an enquiring mind, well that’s my Aunt called it that anyway; I see things that other people overlook, I once did an intelligence test I got 138?”\n“That’s nothing to be ashamed of,” said the professor.\n“I thought so to, as I only did half the test,” I said.\n“Oh”, said Russell.\n“Here is how it’s going to work, you work for me, I point in the direction I would like you to go, you spend a bucket load going there, we see the results, that’s if you still want to, do you?” I asked.\n“Yes” he said.\n“Good I thought so, Are you still tied to the University regards funding?” I asked him.\n“Yes he said till October then I runs out” he said quietly.\n“What happens then” I asked him.\n“I look for a new job” he replied.\n“Well that makes this easy then do you have contacts with the other research team in the US doing similar research?” I asked him. “Yes Why?” he replied.\n“Well you can assist them in their research, while I build you a brand spanking new $150 Mill Research Facility including a cyclotron” I said, “That’s if you want me to, do you.” ‘Yes, does that still include the $120 Mill research grant your offering, would I have to Take that to the Americans?\" he asked.\n“No I’ll give you $50 Mill, so you can go and play with them Russel” I said Laughing, Knowing never to stand between a scientist and a pile of money.\n“Do you think they will let you come and play?” I asked.\n“Shit yea,” he said Laughing.\n“I thought they might” I replied laughing back. “The Facility is going to be up here in Hastings, so I can keep an eye on it, it’s not too far from where you live, I’ll chuck in a house as well, and that’s not a problem is it?” I asked.\n“Not at all, we go there a lot, it’s really lovely,” he said.\n“Glad you like my little part of the world, I want the Americans in on this as well, and I’ll tell you why, I have an electrical background, and the quickest way to find a problem is to have someone, at each end, looking for the fault?”\n“What, the research results?” He asked.\n“Russell a shared Nobel Prize is better than no, Nobel Prize, wouldn’t you say,” I said.\n“You are talking Nobel Prizes, and we haven’t even started up yet” he said.\n“What you don’t think you can do it Russell, That’s not what Willie Schmitt,” said. “Don’t start wimping out on me now big guy,” I said laughing.\n“You sure aim high,” said the Professor.\n“Well what’s the point of turning up to play if you’re not there to fucking win, Russel, Look if you don’t want it give it to me OK”\n“No I’m sure I could find room on my Mantle for it,” he said. Clara stood alongside looking at her watch. “Oh Id Like Ian Redman to be your Research Director, to handle all the paper work involved if that’s OK.”\n“Would he be involved in any findings or results if any?” he asked.\n“Yes he would if he assists you in your research, personally I think its Enzymatic based, sought of cause and effect, and Russell, if that’s the case, you know what that means don’t you,” I asked.\n“You need to make space on your mantle place,” he replied.\n“I thought you would understand, goodnight, Oh Jenny?”\n“Yes Max.”\n“If I can put this bluntly, fuck his brains out and let him go to sleep or he will be up all night”\n“Is that and order,” She said laughing\"\n“No just a request, oh one more thing before the fun begins, If you have any Dramas with a working Visa, let me Know my Brother is a US Senator, Henry William Adams Jr. Democrat Senator for New York State, Now for queen and country do your duty,” I said laughing.\n“You heard Max, Russell, do your duty. Night Max.”\n“Night Guys and Thanks Bye,” I said hanging up.\nClara stood staring at me.\n“What’s Up” I said looking at her.\n“Max who is your father” she said.\n“Why?” I asked.\n“Max just answers the question?” Clara replied.\n“Colonel Henry William Adams USMC Ret, Former Senator for New York State, Why” I asked.\n“Have you talked to your brother lately asked Clara “You might need to give him a ring darling but not now, go to bed, I stood to give her kiss?\n“Don’t get frisky, Anna and I have work to do and you look exhausted, just give me a Kiss,” said Clara.\nI gave her a Kiss a real toe curler, “That should keep you awake,” I laughed.\nClara just smiled “I love you Max Adams now goes, please; there is room in with Allison, Scoot.”\nAnna stuck her head out the door “Go” was all she said.\n“Are we still on for your Tuesday Ravishing?” I said.\n“Max promised to Ravish me on Tuesday” said Anna.\nClara looked at me “Tuesday works, I’ve got Meetings most of the day, your good to go, Now GO” I just went.\nAs I walked down the hall to Allison’s room my phone, rang, luckily I had set it Vibrate, incoming private number. “Max Adams speaking,” I said ducking into a corridor that led to the outside.\n“Lionel Wolfe sorry to call so late, are you able to talk” he asked.\n“Yes sir” I said.\n“Lionel will do Max, I just called to say thank you for all your efforts regarding my family.”\n“I must admit I was a bit hard on some of the member especially Katie and Troy” I replied.\n“The two that needed it the most Garry is extremely appreciative, of your efforts” he replied.\n“Glad to be of assistance, Katie how can I say this can be a bit Forceful?” I said.\n“Is that what they are calling it now days, in my day it was called being a fucking bitch, and I was so looking forward to the superglue” he replied laughing.\n“Do you think it would have held her?” I asked.\n“Probably not” he said laughing louder still.\n“I know it is late so I will get right to the heart of the matter, your daughter Lauren”\nBefore he could finish I said, “How much do you need to take her of my hands”.\n“That’s what I wanted to ask you about, actually, he said laughing I would like her to come to Melbourne after her exams, and I will train her up and give a division of my company to run” he said.\n“You’re going to train her up to run a division of your company?” I said.\n“Yes and once I feel she is ready to run its all hers?” he said.\nI asked “What to Run.”\n“No Max it’s hers as in hers to have” he said.\n“Why, and how big a division are we talking about?” I asked.\n“Queensland, and If she is anything like her father she should do alright” he said.\n“How big is the Queensland division Finance wise?” I asked.\n“Last financial review I was approximately 3.8 Billion gives or take, why” he said.\n“Well it’s lucky you picked Lauren because if you had picked Holly her younger sister she would have taken the whole fucking company,” I said laughing.\nI could hear him laughing loudly at the other end “Why is she that tough is she?” he asked.\n“5 ft 2” tall and all of it trouble, the only two criteria for Holly is Rich and a 12” plus prick” I said laughing.\n“Good to see she has her priorities worked out how old is she if you don’t mind me asking?”\n“12 going on 30” I said.\n“Ouch I must be getting old”, he replied laughing, “Lauren would have to married to Troy”\n“Yea that’s pretty much a given” I said.\n“I would like to ring her if I may, to discuss it with her, and her Mum and Dad?” he said.\n“Good luck with that” I said.\n“That awful” he said.\n“No just a bit of black humour needless to say Holly takes after her Mother, Not Lauren,” I said.\n“Oh thanks for the warning, and her dad?” he asked.\n“They have been together for 20 years, and he loves her more now than at the start,” I said.\n“That’s nice to hear he must be a good bloke,” said Lionel.\n“He’s my best mate, he even allows me to knock her up for him,” I said.\n“He does what,” said Lionel.\n“He had cancer of the balls 17 years ago they took both, it’s a tough job but someone’s got to do it,” I said.\n“That’s why we have mates, Max,” said Lionel laughing.\n“Sure is,” I said as I gave him Laurens Number, “I’m off to bed buddy, Big Day”\nThanks Max.\n“You’re welcome Lionel goodnight, bye.”\nI walked back down the corridor to check on Barney, the female SC was still there. “I thought you went home”, I said.\n“Sgt Stanley thought I had better stay, when he’s told in the morning, he won’t be happy will he” she said.\n“Probably not, I don’t know how he will react he’s a funny little bugger our Barney.”\n“He’s pretty special isn’t he”, she said looking at him sleeping.\n“It’s such a shame a man like that alone” then realising what she had said she blushed.\nI looked at her and asked, “You heard me talking to the Doctor didn’t you?” She just nodded.\n“Well Karen” I Said, After looking at her name badge Senior Constable Karen Barlow, “I’ll put in a good word for you”, as I covered her with a blanket, and kissed her on the cheek.\nShe looked at me and said, “I’d even share him if he wanted to?”\n“You know what, he would be silly not to” I said.\n“Thanks” she said.\n“You’re welcome, get some sleep OK Nite” and went into Allison’s room.\nI went to the toilet and had a quick shower to freshen up, I put on the Hospital pyjamas that they had put out for me and lay back in the arm chair with a blanket over me.\"\nAllison saw me on the chair “Hop in next to me silly you’ll wreck your back, there’s plenty of room in the bed”\n“You sure, I’ll just check your all OK first” I said.\n“The nurse has just been in and checked it all for me, I feel like a VIP,” she said smiling. I climbed into bed alongside “Cuddle me!” she said.\n“You Sure?”\n“You are so silly sometimes Max,” she said kissing me on the cheek. “How many times have we all snuggled together to keep warm when competing at carnivals.”\n“That’s true, but I was lusting after your body,” I said as we cuddled back to front.\n“Are you comfy?” I asked.\n“Yep”\n“Love you,” she said.\n“Love you too, Ally Cat, sweet dreams”, as she turned off the light and we went to sleep.\n",

<p>The women looked on as Klaus, and I drove out from the driveway on to the Five Mile road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Glen doesn&rsquo;t act like Glen,&rdquo; said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Was the question from more than one?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he starts anything or does anything Max will punch his fucking lights out.&rdquo; Anna said</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly has the shoulders and arm muscle, can he take care of himself?&rdquo; asked Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care&rdquo; was the Schmitt chorused reply. &ldquo;Fuck yeah, said Willie. A bloke at one of our surf carnivals said something nasty about the girls. Max told him to keep it clean, this bloke had two mates, big units, Max cleaned up all three of them, and two went to the hospital. Police were called charges laid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the other three dickheads, after Max told the coppers what they said, one of the coppers daughters was in Max&rsquo;s squad, poor bastards&rdquo; finished Willie laughing.</p>
<p>Anna added, &ldquo;Max served his Electrical Trade Apprenticeship in the Mining areas of Central Australia, it was a tough school, apparently, he&rsquo;s a pretty closed book is our Max. Doesn&rsquo;t say a lot, reads all the time, asks questions and listens to the answers, knows a shitload of stuff, you see in the early days of the Mining Industry out West It was a real mixed bag. A lot of foreign workers, Poles, Germans, Italians, and the Yanks, you name any country, it was probably represented&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he gets on well with everybody, he was a jack of all trades did blasting, drove trucks, graders, excavators, geological surveying, Max did it all, you had to sleep out in the field make do. He made a lot of money, buying and selling all sorts of stuff, beer cigarettes you name it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls&rdquo; chorused Inga and Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I will sell you two if you don&rsquo;t give me hand to get these platters out, take these I&rsquo;ll get the wine, White or red ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White please&rdquo; answered Robin &amp; Helena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you Willie, care to join us Girls&rdquo;, asked Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Willie, get your Willy over here&rdquo; laughed Inga, the rest joined in laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behave Miss,&rdquo; said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or I&rsquo;ll tell Max, my Fianc if you do not Mind Mother&rdquo; Inga replied plum in the mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Fianc You greedy Cow&rdquo; said Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God how weird does that sound,&rdquo; Robin added as they all once again, started laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie. Yes. Or No?&rdquo; Anna asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Little Willies sulking, poor baby&rdquo; said Inga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll poor baby you,&rdquo; said Willie. Willie like his Dad did not know when to keep quiet.</p>
<p>Inga and Helena launched the initial assault, Veronica and Robin followed it up, and Anna finished it, Willie naked, grabbed by 5 women tickling him, sucking on his nipples.</p>
<p>Inga looked at Veronica. Veronica went down, latching onto Willies Willy, sucking like a Demon.</p>
<p>Willie was hard in no time. Veronica was just about to hop on to it. When Anna said, &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t want any accidents now, would we ladies&rdquo; as she lowered herself onto her son&rsquo;s prick and proceeded to fuck him senseless.</p>
<p>Robin sat on his face as the other girls sucked his balls, and stuck tongues and fingers up into his arse. Willie having realized what he was in for, proceeded to give as good as he got attacked Robin&rsquo;s clit and labia with gusto. He soon had her screaming wreck, and she rolled off, onto her back.</p>
<p>Inga attached herself to Robins Inflamed and swollen clit &ldquo;Sexually molest my brother bitch, cop this&rdquo; sucking and chewing, and soon had Robin writhing and screaming for mercy.</p>
<p>Willie flooded his mother&rsquo;s cunt with his cream, as Anna rolled off onto her back Helena cleaned up his prick, as Veronica cleaned out the dripping cum from Anna&rsquo;s sodden pussy.</p>
<p>As calm was restored Anna looked at Willie kissed him tenderly, &ldquo;are you OK?&rdquo; Anna asked.</p>
<p>Willie smiled as he kissed his mother,&quot; Dad sure is one lucky old SOB&quot;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rude to my Husband, you little shit&rdquo;, she said as she bit the head of his prick laughing. Willie begged for mercy as they all sat up to have a snack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you girls want some sausage?&rdquo; Anna Asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea Willie how about some sausage&rdquo; his sisters chorused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behave yourself&rdquo; Anna said &ldquo;and sit down&rdquo; as she bought out a 12&rsquo;&rsquo; long 6&quot; round German Salami.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how Max is going&rdquo; Anna added, Picking up the salami, and a knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Mean Brian&rdquo; Veronica deadpanned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way&rdquo; yelled Inga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes fucking way, really&rdquo; said Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OMG&rdquo; Inga giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would need it with Stephanie&rdquo;, Anna said &ldquo;Shit sorry, did I say that out loud, don&rsquo;t repeat that please, and don&rsquo;t swear you two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robin looked at Veronica &ldquo;really is it that big?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, that is little thicker Mum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God no wonder Maxie calls Stephanie the hole&rdquo; she blushed while looking at Anna and laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you know why he wanted us to help him and Stephanie tries to make a baby, he didn&rsquo;t want to fall in&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lauren told me the first time he turned up to make a baby, he had a length of 4x2 he said was to go across his arse in case he fell in&rdquo; Veronica finished to hysterical laughter all round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our Max said Anna, God he is such a funny bugger he is totally outrageous, I don&rsquo;t know how he gets away with it, I really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do&rdquo; replied Robin After talking to people who have known him for years, anybody who has a problem or dramas Max is first there to help, no fuss no press, just helps out and goes on his Merry way.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lecherous old goat, but we all love him&rdquo;, Anna replied giggling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would Stephanie need Max to have more babies?&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brian Had cancer, and had both testicles taken out&rdquo; replied Anna.</p>
<p>Robin had tears in her eyes, &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, you didn&rsquo;t know&rdquo; said Anna, giving her a hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum loves massive dicks,&rdquo; Veronica added helpfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica&rdquo; Robin screeched in laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well you do, don&rsquo;t deny it, R was hung like a plough horse, well you said you missed, being fucked by a monster dick&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well we&rsquo;ve got Willie he&rsquo;s the biggest dick I know,&rdquo; said Inga helpfully, at poor Willies expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;R did you say said Inga who&rsquo;s R&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raymond Edward Curtis the Third&rdquo; said Robin aka as RC3&quot;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OMG you mean RC3 the rapper, you know RC3 said Inga OMG.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum was married to RC3,&rdquo; she said with that smirk that says shove that up your jumper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullshit&rdquo; said Inga.</p>
<p>Helena added ever so helpfully &ldquo;now we know why Max wanted Robin, Mum, to keep the kids at Bay&rdquo; In an instant, becoming the target of, thrown insults, as well as thrown bread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behave you lot&rdquo; said Anna laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really&rdquo; said Robin. &ldquo;For nearly Six years, 2 kids as well. Tommy who is nearly 13 and Shawna who is just turned 11&rdquo;. &ldquo;God what a life,&rdquo; she said smiling shaking her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been exciting&rdquo;, said Inga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea it was I suppose, at first when he was starting out, it turned into a soap opera though. He&rsquo;s got three quarters of his family leeching of him bleeding him dry, poor bugger he doesn&rsquo;t have a clue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t had a hit in ages, he&rsquo;s bought a ton of stuff for his Family, and they still want more, I had had enough. I told him he should cut back on what he was spending, he went ballistic, I filed for Divorce, got my payout, and came back to Melbourne.&rdquo; said Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you move up here?&rdquo; asked Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad Business decisions and unhealthy relationships, once they found out I was married to RC, it was can you do this, can you show him this song. I invested the rest, got a diploma in Marketing and Business and her we are&rdquo;, she said smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only two of his family worth a dam are his stepsister Yolanda and Darryl his cousin or &ldquo;Big D&rdquo; or just D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why big D, said Inga has he got a really big you know what?&rdquo; she asked giggling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea he has actually, but he&rsquo;s just BIG, 6&rsquo; 7&rsquo;&rsquo; tall and about 300 pounds what&rsquo;s that about 160kg. And not a lot of it fat either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus, he would eat more than Inga, said Willie, no probably not,&rdquo; he laughed as they threw more food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you lot are going to pick that up&rdquo; said Anna, laughing along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum&rdquo; said Veronica quietly from the end of the table once the laughter died down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Darling&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Grant Whitney, and why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
<p>The room went quiet Robin beckoned her up to sit on her lap, kissed her cheek and started by saying.&ldquo;Think of the worst person you could imagine knowing, and that the person giving you the best present, ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What present did he give you mum?&rdquo; Veronica asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, my gorgeous girl&rdquo; Robin answered giving her a hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what did he do, Mum?&rdquo; Veronica asked, trying to fill in the missing pieces of her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will discuss this with you and Max as well Darling. I won&rsquo;t go into details here, but I will say this, It started out OK and he got involved in dealing drugs and he got me involved as well, and I did something&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m not proud of&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to leave a couple of times&rdquo;. Robin sighed, as she looked at the other faces. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that easy to see what someone&rsquo;s like when you are in a fishbowl with them, he&rsquo;s dead which I am glad to say is a good thing. I mean that baby, because to hurt me for leaving, he would have hurt you, he had turned that bad. He was well raised, well educated, his Fathers dead and his Mother your Grandmother, still live in Melbourne in Toorak, and she&rsquo;s Lady Francis Whitney?&rdquo; Looking over at Anna, who had lived in Melbourne?</p>
<p>Anna mouthed &ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah huh said Robin, Shit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there you go my sweet kissing and hugging her, now some of the puzzle is complete&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I meet her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not I will talk it over with Max and we will work it out, OK.&rdquo; Robin replied.</p>
<p>Veronica started to bristle. Robin said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get mad at me Miss I&rsquo;m your Mother irrespective of whom we are marrying. Max will want to do what&rsquo;s right for you, because the last time I took you to see her, she threw me out of the house onto the street, OK, and it&rsquo;s not something I want you, to have to deal with without support?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Mum sorry&rdquo;, said Veronica giving Robin a massive hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides Missy Moo, what&rsquo;s the deal with you and Charlie Dog, young Lady?&rdquo; she asked as Veronica went Crimson to her toenails as she remembered what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe later OK Mum she said trying to get out of explaining.</p>
<p>Which only got a chorus of &ldquo;Bullshit, You&rsquo;re a real Bitch&rdquo; said Inga laughing her head off. &ldquo;Tell us please tell us,&rdquo; Inga and Helena whined.</p>
<p>Veronica looked at each in turn and said, &ldquo;You have to swear this stays only within the Family OK&rdquo; &ldquo;We swear, we swear,&rdquo; they all chorused including Anna.</p>
<p>Veronica looked over at Willie who was humming who let the dogs out. &ldquo;Willie I want your word, Not a Fucking Peep, OK or I will drop you in the shit, with Max, OK&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; he said smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I will make something up OK&rdquo; as the smile disappeared from Willies face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair?&rdquo; said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know said Veronica, but it worked, walking over and kissing Willie, I wouldn&rsquo;t do that to you. You Mother Fucker&rdquo; which as one imagined caused hysterical laughter to erupt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem recall you doing some mother fucking of your own,&rdquo; said Inga, as the laughter died down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re confused dear, I&rsquo;m a Mother Licker&rdquo; she replied hugging Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too&rdquo; said Inga hugging Robin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK said Robin, Charlie Dog and it had better be a short story as our boys should be back shortly, and Max will want that info.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veronica launched into what had happened and the result of it all as she finished Inga looked a Robin and smiled. &ldquo;We are SO getting another Dog, don&rsquo;t you think Robin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robin looked at Anna and laughed shaking her head. &ldquo;To think yesterday my Major decision was whether to buy more beans or sprouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beans the rest said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Its Dogs, global finance, heaven know what&rsquo;s next&rdquo; she smiled shaking her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh said Veronica did you get that Promotion you went for&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;Graham the produce buyer thought I wasn&rsquo;t ready for that much responsibility the bastard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah well said Anna &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t have worry about that any more will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before either of you say a word, school is still ongoing for you both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not fair said Inga to Veronica, I get married, and I still get bossed around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this info for our Man, Ladies&rdquo;, Robin said giving them both a hug and a kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we finish can I lick you out again, you taste really yummy?&rdquo; Inga inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inga&rdquo; her mother squealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, it&rsquo;s, a perfectly valid Question, I don&rsquo;t think Max is going to be 100% for a day or two, and I&rsquo;m Horny&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anna &amp; Robin looked at each other. &ldquo;Yea she&rsquo;s Right said Robin, how is Max going to cope with us all, we will kill the poor Bugger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were me, said Willie. I would bring in reinforcements, to help out when needed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder If Stephanie would lease out Brian, for Mum to get her Big Dick Fix&rdquo;, Veronica said to Inga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could always ask Stephanie,&rdquo; said Inga before Robin could go off; they promptly fell about Laughing on the sofa.</p>
<p>Anna Looked at Robin and said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fantastic idea Girls well done&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robin replied &ldquo;Works for me Ill run that by Maxie, Thanks Girls&rdquo; giving Anna a Wink.</p>
<p>Anna started the Fire as it was starting to get a bit Chilly. Moreover, they all got down to preparing their reports for Max.</p>
<hr>
<p>As Klaus and I were just about off the MacKinnon&rsquo;s driveway, I asked Klaus &ldquo;you reckon it&rsquo;s too late to Drop into Barneys Place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klaus looked at the clock, &ldquo;yeah he will be loaded for sure by now poor bastard&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Barney Reynolds had taken the death of his wife Michelle, and his two boys Bradley and Cameron, extremely hard. Michelle and the boys coming back from Rugby match. When a truck, coming the other direction. Had a blown Tyre and killed them all instantly. The court case was still ongoing.</p>
<p>Barney had stayed home to look after Allison, who had the flu. Barney had symptoms as well. They decided that Michelle would go and take the boys and stay overnight, as it was a four-hour drive back home, late on a winter&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Being concerned at the condition of Barney and Allison they decided after a bit of cajoling from Barney that they would come home to look after them.</p>
<p>The accident occurred 40 minutes from home on the main highway. Guilt is a funny thing Barney who had seemed so brave and stoic. He had been in the army a genuine war hero Warrant Office Barnabas Reynolds, Medal of Gallantry, Silver Star and Bar, Mentioned in Dispatches.</p>
<p>He had been a forward Recon observer in Afghanistan when he noticed a group of Taliban about to Ambush Two Platoons of US Marines, opened Fire Killing 5 or six of the enemy and been wounded when they had attacked him from above.</p>
<p>He had ordered a close air strike in direct opposition from his superiors saving his own and the Americans lives and promptly putting a 24-year career down the toilet.</p>
<p>Apparently telling a Colonel to go Fuck Himself, and to go and sell fried chicken is not a done thing. Michelle was Deputy Principle at the Local primary school; Barney had gone back to Uni obtaining a Degree in Logistics Management. His moving shit on a Truck Degree he called it.</p>
<p>Life had been fantastic, nice house, lovely wife great kids and a great Life. It had all gone to shit after Michelle and the boys deaths. Barney liked a drink, and he took to it energetically. He was trying to find peace, in the bottom of a bottle of whisky. Hastings did not have a Village Drunk; Barney was the successful applicant for that position.</p>
<p>Allison now nearly 16 went the other way. If it walked, and talked and had two legs and a penis Allison had probably fucked it or combination of him his mates, who knew. She had applied to be the Village slut; she won the job when she fucked a visiting football team, or so the story went.</p>
<p>We had helped when we could some more than others did and some giving up. I can be a stubborn shit so I was still fighting the good fight so to speak. Allison had been an outstanding swimmer and competitor I had pitted her against Inga it had worked well, up until her Mother and her brothers died.</p>
<p>She had gone, come back, and gone away again. Pretty, 5&rsquo; 6&rdquo;&rsquo; tall, Dark Reddy Brown, curly hair, green eyes, nice figure, good tits a terrific kid. It broke my heart to see them like this.</p>
<p>We had started on the road back to Klaus&rsquo;s house when half mile from Barneys turn off a silver Nissan GTR with no lights on nearly ran into us head on, &ldquo;Fucking bastard did you get his number Klaus&rdquo; as I looked in the mirror to see if I could get the number plate. I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brake&rdquo; Klaus screamed grabbing the wheel and turning it towards the embankment. I braked hard. I heard a thud, front panel right hand side. Looking out I could see a body laying on the road it was a young girl. Hazards flashing, I opened the door and stepped out, it was Allison Reynolds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Allie Klaus&rdquo;, I said looking at her covered in dirt blood and cum. I lifted her dress up to look at her thighs, she was a mass of dried blood, semen, and god knows what else.</p>
<p>I grabbed the waterproof blanket from the back wrapped her up and put her into the back seat It looked as if she had been fucked by the seventh fleet.</p>
<p>Klaus got in to hold her as I sped down the road towards Klaus house to get Anna to have a look at her. Anna had a nursing degree and was our First aid officer when we had training and surf carnivals.</p>
<p>Klaus said &ldquo;I got a Partial Number from the car BB and LF&rdquo; I looked at him as we turned into drive, &ldquo;Troy Wolfe&rdquo; I said BBDWLF &ldquo;Big Bad Wolf&rdquo; well I was going wolf hunting I needed a Rug.</p>
<p>I turned the car around grabbing my mobile.</p>
<p>I ran into the house and yelled &ldquo;Anna First aid Kit, Back seat Allison Reynolds Now Move&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I Pressed call &ldquo;Get me the, Duty Watch Commander Now, its Councillor Max Adams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry he&rsquo;s unavailable&rdquo;, was the answer I received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake him up before I ring the Local paper and have half the fucking district coppers arrested, I know where all the skeletons are buried, now Fucking Get Him&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes Sir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sgt Edward Stanley, this had better be seriously fucking urgent.&rdquo; Was what I got in reply?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Adams Stan I have Allison Reynolds In the back seat of my Car&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky you&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to join that at other cunt swimming at the 40 fathoms stay on that track&rdquo;. &ldquo;Wait one Ed&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anna walked up saying &ldquo;she looks as if she has assaulted front and back there is bruising on her thighs, and a bruise on her hip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take her to the district hospital 50 mins away. Or the local private&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t take emergencies&rdquo;, said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to bet&rdquo;. I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ed sorry about that&rdquo; Allison looks as she&rsquo;s been sexually assaulted I&rsquo;m taking her into to Local Private get a Woman PC and a patrol car to meet me there. I know who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Troy Wolfe he nearly cleaned Klaus and I up coming home from Alex&rsquo;s Place. It was silver Nisan GTR partial BB LF, on a personal plate, heading back towards Town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck&rdquo; he said his family are heavy hitters&quot;. Troy was the Grandson of Lionel Wolfe Trucking Magnate and Billionaire. Troy&rsquo;s father Garry was worth net about $600 million in his own right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK Ed I have gone up a few points in the rankings I now outweigh both of them&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ed Gary Wolfe&rsquo;s worth what about 600 mill give or take&rdquo; I said. I added Ed, got a calculator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Why?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Divide 600 into 20,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose 20,000?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me Ed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That 20, it can&rsquo;t be a B can it, Fuck&rdquo;, he said sounding stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit, you have gone up, Not the Money Pit,&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep the pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always were a lucky bastard. How serious is Allison?&rdquo; he asked getting down to business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad mate they went front and back and tore her to pieces&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit no wonder your upset&rdquo;, Ed replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK got to go Anna&rsquo;s calling, hope there is no radar on the way in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send another car to escort you hope they can keep up&rdquo; I could hear him talking in the background, &ldquo;they will meet you there Max&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks Ed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worries Max, I won&rsquo;t need my Bathers will I?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mate it&rsquo;s all OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ed a favour, I said as I walked to the car, Minimal paperwork low key of the Radar, reputations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand last thing we need is more publicity, the Wolfe&rsquo;s will appreciate that I&rsquo;m sure&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck the Wolfe&rsquo;s I was thinking of Allison, Whoever&rsquo;s involved bring their parents to the hospital as well, Ed, Got to Go Bye&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anna had checked her vitals and left her wrapped in the blanket. She had strapped Allison into the seat and was holding here in position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Klaus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea Max.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Barney whatever condition Bring him in as well, Take Willie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Klaus asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because when he finds out what the Bastards have done to Allison he will kill them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so Max,&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do if they did that to Inga&rdquo; He just nodded.</p>
<p>I looked over at my Girls &ldquo;you girls take care I said I m staying with Alison OK Love you guys&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye, Max&rdquo;. They said kissing me.</p>
<p>I now hold the fasted time from the Five mile to the Hasting Private.</p>
<p>All Anna said, &ldquo;Fuck this thing can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy, you one OK&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on&rdquo;. She replied laughing.</p>
<p>I pulled up at the hospital foyer and pushed on the bell hard it kept ringing, a badly dressed overweight woman with a sour look said &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to go to the public hospital we don&rsquo;t take Emergency Patients&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do now because if you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll drive this car through this door,&rdquo; I told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am calling the Police,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The police pulled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man has threatened to drive his car through the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Senior Constable looked at me, and looked at her, &ldquo;Well you had better open the door then or he will do it&rdquo;, the door opened, and Allison was carried into the hospital.</p>
<p>Nurses came from all directions, and placed Allison on a Gurney, a Female Doctor in a suit was just leaving as we entered &ldquo;Can you have a Look at her for us, please?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an Emergency Doctor,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I looked at old cranky face and said &ldquo;any other Doctors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Doc, you volunteered&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m&rdquo;</p>
<p>I just said to her &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t attend to her after they have taken the necessary swabs etc. for forensics you won&rsquo;t need to worry about being a doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rdquo;, she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ll get 10 kids to tell you sexually abused them in the surgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not&rdquo; she angrily replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to take the risk, your choice&rdquo;. I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc I&rsquo;m your best Friend, or your worst Nightmare, You Pick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could see old cranky face Making a phone call, and looking in my Direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; I asked one of the other nurses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is related somehow to the owners, the Morgan group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this place going?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She said quietly &ldquo;it&rsquo;s for sale, its losing money hand over fist&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rdquo;, I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not large enough&rdquo; was the answer I received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was going OK,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The council will not let us expand, and the new state school is going where we were going to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I had voted against that decision at my first meeting. I told that to the Nurse.</p>
<p>She said I know, I am in your District,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you vote for me?&rdquo; I asked her smiling.</p>
<p>Yes, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good what is your Name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet Walkom, she said.</p>
<p>Just then, Klaus turned up with Barney he was  loaded but still sought of OK. Cranky face came up. She was just as she was about to say something.</p>
<p>I held my hand and said to Barney &ldquo;Allison&rsquo;s had a bit of an accident nothing Major she&rsquo;s been Taken Care of Mate Ill look after her. You get some rest, and I&rsquo;ll see you in the Morning&rdquo;.</p>
<p>They took him away towards the room. &ldquo;Just you wait here a moment you cannot come in here and just take over&rdquo; she said sounding upset.</p>
<p>I looked at her face and smiled looked at her staff Badge Clara Madjakowski. Admissions Manager, &ldquo;Clara that mans daughter has been sexually assaulted, by some sons of some extremely wealthy individuals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry Wolfe is one of them&rdquo;, she went pale &ldquo;yep, and Allison&rsquo;s farther is a drunk only because his wife and 2 boys were killed in a car accident. With me so far, he is a decorated war hero&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was awarded, if you will excuse the French, a shit load of medals for killing a whole heap of Taliban? Now what do you think he is going to do when he wakes up. I will get ugly real quick don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded in tears, &ldquo;Give me a hug you big softy&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;your all bark and no bite I bet&rdquo;. I hugged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I bite&rdquo;, she replied smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch&rdquo; I laughed and kissed her cheek, and she smiled.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how the patient is going&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We walked into the room as the Female officer was finishing &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; I asked the Doctor and WSC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is going to need stitches at the front. And her anal cavity is quite badly bruised; I have taken swabs and forensic evidence as well&rdquo; there was brown paper bags all over the bed. &ldquo;Plus I took 40 Photos&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I looked at Clara &ldquo;can you copy and print them off here?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they on a card?&rdquo; Clara asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>The SC said, &ldquo;That will break the chain of evidence; It could affect the trial,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not going to be a trial they would crucify her in court?&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biggest you can get, full colour please Clara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor turned to us. Clara was hurrying, to get the prints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in heavens name did you do that&rdquo;, she asked, as, Anna stood and watched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever watch Crocodile Dundee One?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Yes, they all nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that scene, with the water buffalo&rdquo;, I answered and smiled. They all bit their tongues, to stop laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max, you are so cruel, but god that was so funny,&rdquo; said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Max Adams&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one and only, and what have I done now?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She kissed me on the cheek, &ldquo;tried to save this Hospital is all&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like I wasn&rsquo;t successful its being sold mores the pity&rdquo;. I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry Max, Doctor Emma Wilson&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilson, You&rsquo;re not Charlie Wilsons Misses are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He passed away Heart Disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to hear that, Old No mess, was a close friend of mine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No what&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was an ad on TV &ldquo;No mess, Charlie the Plumber&rdquo; It sought of stuck, I said. &ldquo;Charlie told me had met a good-looking girl in Sydney&rdquo;, Charlie&rsquo;s father had owned a plumbing business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what brings you back up here, I asked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His parents and my 2 Kids?&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>She was just about to say something, when the nurse said &ldquo;she&rsquo;s ready to be stitched Doctor&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is she going?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She should be Ok with rest once I get theses stitches in,&rdquo; said the doctor, looking worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stitch worth a dam,&rdquo; said the Doc Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK I can, Ill fix her up lets go&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You can well imagine the looks that got, we cannot let you do that Public Liability etc, etc. I walked in, and Allison was awake lying on the bed legs apart all on display.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Ally Cat, how are you going sweetheart&rdquo;, as I bent down kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to me, I feel like I&rsquo;ve been hit by a truck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&rdquo; I said looking at them all, &ldquo;a Range Rover that was me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rdquo; asked Ally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bloody walked out in front of me you goose&rdquo;. I said laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor the local is wearing off&rdquo; said the nurse sounding anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey Allison the Doc Cant stitch for crap, want me to have a go at it, you need about half a dozen or so, OK&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did a pretty fair job on your eyebrow remember&rdquo;. Ally, hit by a surfboard and had needed three stitches to close it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea OK Max&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to hear something funny Ally, besides your Dad, I&rsquo;m most likely the only bloke not to have seen your pussy lately&rdquo; I said laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop making me laugh it hurts?&rdquo; Allison replied giggling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I can&rsquo;t hear there&rsquo;s an echo&rdquo;, I replied as I washed my hands to put on my gloves, &ldquo;Ally one plank or two?&rdquo; I asked looking around her leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She asked me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One plank or two, across their arse to stop falling in&rdquo;, the Doctor and the other Nurses did not know where to look to try and not laugh. &ldquo;OK Doc, watch, and learn&rdquo;, I Picked up the needle, and said, &ldquo;It is just a small prick&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ally said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;ve been told.&rdquo; as laughter erupted from the room.</p>
<p>I stitched her up, as I had put in the last stitch, and tied it off. I said to &ldquo;Ally good to go for another 20 Thousand OK Kiddo. Want to have a look?&rdquo; &ldquo;Got a Mirror handy,&rdquo; I said to the Doctor. &ldquo;You see where I tied it of it holds the others tight&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on in here?&rdquo; said a voice behind my back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fanny stitching 101&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Allison put her legs down as I held the Mirror for her to see the result &ldquo;I asked what was going on,&rdquo; he said. Clara had bought the pictures back they were horrible, but just what I wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&rdquo; I said showing him the pictures&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do admissions,&rdquo; he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do now,&rdquo; I said winking at Clara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you and what are you doing in my Hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Hospital how much do you want for it. I asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am calling the police,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; said the senior we are already here&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want this Man arrested at once,&rdquo; he said looking at the officer.</p>
<p>I just looked at the officer, said, &ldquo;How many children did he sexually abuse then, was it 6 or 7&rdquo;, and looked on as the blood drained from his face. &ldquo;Doctor whoever sit down and shut up OK&rdquo;. I said pointing to a chair outside. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that look Ally like new?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, it looks tiny&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep it that way, Your Dads in the other room get some sleep I&rsquo;ll see you later on I&rsquo;m staying here OK&rdquo; I Gave her a kiss Love you Kiddo. Now sleep&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry Doctor, Councillor Max Adams&rdquo; I said introducing myself.</p>
<p>He looked at the photos shaking his head, &ldquo;how could they do that&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they can, and think they can get away with it&rdquo;. I said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Ian Redman&rdquo; he replied shaking my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry for being such an arse in there, I know her family, and I love that Girl, she&rsquo;s a sweetheart&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Just then, two police cars and three other cars pulled up out the Front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there somewhere Private I can have a chat to these parents and their kids&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes there, the board room&rdquo; he answered pointing down the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you Doctor You Lot follow after me now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police ushered them in to the Boardroom &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Going on?&rdquo; Kate Wolfe. Garry&rsquo;s wife asked.</p>
<p>I ignored her. &ldquo;How are you Garry?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>As Kate asked yet again &ldquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garry, put a muzzle on that bitch before I superglue her face to her cunt&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She was just about to go off when the Sgt who had Just walked In &ldquo;I&rsquo;d Sit Down, shut up, or Ill Help him Do It. Now Sit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been going on,&rdquo; I said as I showed them the photos, the men went white, and two of the mothers were physically sick, into garbage bins outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls get cleaned up, well sought this out man to man&rdquo; Garry glared at Kate, Kate went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok it&rsquo;s like this there is a truckload of evidence your boys have been placed at the scene, She is Under 16, So whether consent was granted or not they will all be charged with having sex with a minor, Probably put on a data base, criminal conviction no government work, you get the picture&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s a slut&rdquo; one of the boys smirked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes she is you didn&rsquo;t need to hurt her, and if you interrupt me again Ill dump you off over the 40 Fathom Drop off where that other child molesting cunt went your call&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the Police?&rdquo; said one of the fathers?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think owned the fucking boat?&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right this stops here Now, What I want from each of you is Half a million Dollars, that&rsquo;s Right you heard correctly. &ldquo;Five hundred Thousand Each By close of business tomorrow, say 5.00pm&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get that sought of Money&rdquo; they replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gary can get it from his Father&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or this is what&rsquo;s going to happen this story will be on the front page of every major Paper, web sites, international, and I will use all of My 20 Billion Dollars, That&rsquo;s right 20 Billion, to turn your lives and the lives of all your Family into a smoking fucking ruin&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that&rdquo; was the chorused reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s either that or you will all be dead within the week, why you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ed what did Allison&rsquo;s father Barney, Do before he became town drunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy Max He was paid by the government to kill people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any good at it&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck yea gave him a shit load of Medals&rdquo;, he replied as they all went white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So call it life insurance, you&rsquo;re Life Insurance and if he doesn&rsquo;t succeed I will get people to help OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you four, I said looking at the boys. &ldquo;This all got out of hand I&rsquo;m guessing am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Sir&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so you didn&rsquo;t have to hurt Her If You wanted a dog and Pony show she would have bought the fucking dog&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why because three people who she loved most in the world her Mum and two little brothers were killed when a truck had a blowout pure dumb luck wrong place wrong time&rdquo;. I know you guys are not bad OK,&rdquo; I said pausing before continuing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is how it&rsquo;s going to go down, you will apologise to Allison, whatever plans you have for the rest of the year, forget them Don&rsquo;t care, not going to happen, you will be doing every shitty job that I and other people can find for you all from now until Christmas, no arguments, Non Negotiable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Young Mr Wolfe, You my boy are going to marry my daughter Lauren, I&rsquo;m her father, Brian is her dad. Not only did you break her Cherry you broke her heart so It&rsquo;s about 25 to life for you, Oh I&rsquo;ll be buggering your arse into next week and when I finish her Dad will be starting OK?&rdquo; Troy just nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I know about you and Serena Taylor Not going to happen&rdquo;. The women came back into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate come here please&rdquo;, I just gave her a kiss on the cheek and a hug &ldquo;Sorry for being a shit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK and this message, for all of you. You are not their fucking friends. You are their parents; if they want, love and Affection get them a dog. You think you lot have got Dramas I&rsquo;ve got three women I&rsquo;m to Marry, and I get to have this Muppet, Pointing at Troy as a son in law, I&rsquo;ve got to tell Lauren she&rsquo;s Getting married to Someone she&rsquo;s been burning in Effigy for the past Month, Care to swap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all happy, OK Ill see how the patients going&rdquo;. I was just about to leave the room when Garry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max when was that truck accident, with her Mother?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two months before Lizzy was killed mid 2009,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit I could have been one of mine, or dads, I will look into it?&rdquo; a note of concern in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all might think I&rsquo;m being dramatic, but no one wins with this type of crap, No Body, Not Allison. Not You Guys, Not the Town, Especially the Town, that&rsquo;s all we need headlines &ldquo;Billionaires Son in Child Rape&rdquo; That will read well down south don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang I&rsquo;ll get some, Coffee&rdquo; as Clara bought coffee into the room for all, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and check on the patient?&rdquo; I walked down to see Allison, as Glen was talking on the Phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you Kiddo ready to see the Mongol hoard?&rdquo; I said laughing at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea&rdquo; she said, will you stay with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the girls say that&rdquo;, I said smiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given her a mild sedative to help ease the pain,&rdquo; said Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks Doc You Go home and get some rest as well&rdquo; Emma said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty special isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have seen her Mum, Smart, Funny Pretty; she met Barney that was it. He was worried that she was much smarter than he was I said &ldquo;Barney, that just Proves how smart you are for knowing that&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know why Doc, the sexiest part of a woman&rsquo;s anatomy isn&rsquo;t between her legs it&rsquo;s between her ears&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She kissed me on the cheek &ldquo;you are just too smooth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah Doc play fair, your breaking my Heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara Thinks you&rsquo;re pretty special&rdquo;, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she like as an administrator?&rdquo; I asked Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fantastic not a lot of personality&rdquo; said Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need a personal assistant who I feel safe around, and my girls Like&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Emma asked &ldquo;Your Daughters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No my wives&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She shook her head &ldquo;Dare I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got three for the moment,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to manage that?&rdquo; asked Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah said I that is, the problem. I need to look into that&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ready Ally?&rdquo; I asked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send them one at a time, please, Max&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you Clara, let em in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they trooped in one after the other, Allison being, Ally forgave them and gave them each a kiss. Troy was last in, as his father and mother watched on, Allison had beckoned him over, as he bent down, she grabbed hold of his balls and squeezed. Hard, as tears formed in his eyes she relaxed her grip a little, and said, &ldquo;You had better look after Lauren OK&rdquo; and squeezed them again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK&rdquo; he just managed to squeak.</p>
<p>She pulled him over and kissed him on the cheek again saying, &ldquo;Once I&rsquo;m better if Laurens up for a threesome, I&rsquo;m good to go, OK&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, she said I&rsquo;m not going to become a nun, now piss of and let me get some sleep&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my Ally Cat,&rdquo; I said, looking at the others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We had better let her get some rest said Emma&rdquo; shaking her head as she closed the door. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s unbelievable,&rdquo; she muttered shaking her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It runs in the family,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they finally got her father to hospital after the fight he had 4 bullets in him, plus shell fragments from the bombs, he&rsquo; s as tough as old Boots and she&rsquo;s like her Dad,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the enemy bombed him?&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No he called in an air strike, Danger Close, say from here to the other side of the foyer entry&rdquo; I said a distance of about 50 meters.</p>
<p>I had my arm around Clara as Garry said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just Fucking Insane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Think, his reason was If he was going to go those Bastards were going with him, you know what he said to the Forward Air Controller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rdquo; said Garry?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you fuck this up, I&rsquo;ll come back and fucking haunt you&rdquo; as we all burst in to laughter.</p>
<p>Ally called out &ldquo;Piss of you lot I&rsquo;m trying to go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry Kiddo&rdquo; as we moved away, I looked at the Wolfe&rsquo;s, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s who you are dealing with Garry you really want to fuck with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a No&rdquo; he said, Karen and Troy just shook their head. I looked at my watch 11.15pm. &ldquo;Go on you lot Bugger of, Clara and I have work to Do&rdquo;, I said looking at Troy &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the Nuts Buddy need the Doc to have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right thanks Mr Adams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lad&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max I&rsquo;ve talked to Dad, and he&rsquo;s going to see what he came come up with for Allison, I sent him some of photos of Ally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Happy&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea, Ballistic&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, It deserved Ballistic, hopefully it will be all sorted tomorrow,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Mr Reynolds said Doctor Emma, does he require anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure does Doc he needs a reason not to get shitfaced every day; he needs somebody who&rsquo;s smart, caring, really pretty, with a couple of Kids&rdquo; I replied looking at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know anyone who fits the Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, he&rsquo;s&rdquo;. She muttered</p>
<p>I answered before she could go on, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s what? I said, a drunk sure is, he never was before the accident. He hardly ever drank; we all need someone to love Doc. Especially if we have lost someone, Is it the same no, sometimes its better, who knows, I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I interrupted again &ldquo;What your university educated, and he&rsquo;s not. Michele his wife said to me one day &ldquo;you know what Max that old man of mine is smarter than nearly all of my professors, at University. He&rsquo;s read every classic Novel known to Man, least twice, he could go to University and do a Final exam no study and have degree tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at Garry &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been out to Alex MacKinnon&rsquo;s place haven&rsquo;t you, How was it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God Max that place is Paradise,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I will tell you this for free, and don&rsquo;t tell Alex, not that it matters I&rsquo;ve bought it, Barneys place make Alex&rsquo;s look like the car park out there,&rdquo; I said pointing out side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rdquo; said Garry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s untouched never been worked on, nothing it&rsquo;s pristine. It is the best place on the planet to raise a whole parcel of Kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow&rdquo; was all he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, and I&rsquo;m going to buy it from him. Why would he sell it, because I will own all the Five Mile Boyo lock stock and barrel and any developer who fucks with me had better bring an army, now bugger of, Clara and I have got work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep on it for me Emma OK, Behave, and don&rsquo;t talk to strangers, now go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Clara and I walked away I heard Doc Emma say to Anna &ldquo;Is he always like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, He is not quite 100%&rdquo; Anna replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he sick?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s that my daughter and her Girlfriend and Mother fucked him senseless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Kidding&rdquo; said Kate looking at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for you Doc you had better snap up Barney before someone else grabs him&rdquo; said Anna as Emma looked at me walking away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gotten to you hasn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; said Anna looking at Emma, who nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has that effect our Max does&rdquo; Said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for you Miss&rdquo; said Anna looking at Kate, &ldquo;Give your husband his Balls Back, Clip numb nuts here behind the ear go home fuck each other stupid, and thank your lucky stars Max sorted this out, not Barney, Now Go&rdquo; she said opening the door Kissing them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you Troy Wolfe look after my goddaughter, or you, will go missing&rdquo;. Anna closed the door.</p>
<p>Clara and I walked into her Office I sat on the other chair as she sat at her desk, &ldquo;Before we start I have an apology to make to you&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara held up her hand for me to stop. &ldquo;The water Buffalo?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I just nodded, she got up came over and kissed me and said, &ldquo;That comment, Max Adams is the fucking funniest thing I have ever heard in my life, don&rsquo;t worry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do worry I would like you to work for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what capacity?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My personal assistant and Go to person&rdquo;, I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would this position involve you having sex with me?&rdquo; said Clara.</p>
<p>Now you are not going to believe this but I was lost for words, uncommon but true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max answer the girl why don&rsquo;t you&rdquo; said Anna leaning against the door, Looking on at my discomfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you want me to,&rdquo; I said looking at them both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; Clara said Looking First at me then Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not in love with you&rdquo;, I said, appealing to Anna for Help, she just left me Hanging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that?&rdquo; said Clara, &ldquo;Could you come in and close the door, please Anna&rdquo;, as Anna closed the door. Clara started to speak &ldquo;wait until I&rsquo;ve Finished Max, before asking any Questions OK&rdquo;, I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Polish, and I&rsquo;m Jewish said Clara, if we were an animal species we would be classed Endangered thanks to an Austrian House Painter called Hitler. Now this hospital is owned by the Morgan group, yes, and I am Sir Paul Morgan&rsquo;s Niece, I own including this Hospital and Other assets about 30% of the company, I could Buy your big patch of Dirt, your share of 20 Billion, and still have more than 40% of my holdings&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you did for that girl and her family was the noblest thing I have ever seen in my Life, you would have spent it all to ruin them wouldn&rsquo;t you. I nodded yes, thought so said Clara, now about me, my life is my work I buy I sell I make a little here, a little there it soon adds up. I have everything I need in my life except for two things, someone who loves me, and wants children. Max look at me I, am built for comfort, not for speed. So you want me, to work for you, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I do not fuck it up, this is a very different ball game, I feel like I did my First day at school&rdquo;, I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened at school?&rdquo; asked Clara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find were to get my lunch, I got beaten up and I got lost walking home&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got into a fight on your first day at school.&rdquo; Said Clara</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I got beaten up; I didn&rsquo;t get into a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; said Clara looking at Anna shaking her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stole Emily Jenkins Vegemite sandwich, and she belted me&rdquo; Clara and Anna dissolved into hysterical laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your first day at school, you had the crap beaten out of you by a girl&rdquo; said Clara trying hard not fall apart again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened on the second day did she beat you up again?&rdquo; asked Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No she became my girlfriend up until she moved away, in fifth class&rdquo;. I started laughing, and that sent Clara and Anna of, once again.</p>
<p>Clara looked at me &ldquo;you are the strangest man I have ever met Max Black&rdquo; I stood up and lifted Clara onto her desk pushing her skirt up past her Thighs exposing a Peacock Blue pair of French Knickers.</p>
<p>I pulled them down of her bottom past her milky white thighs, which framed a thatch of thick black silken hair covering her cunt. Her mound rose higher, I ran my hand up the outer edge of her mound parting her outer flaps with my finger causing her to shudder, As I pushed my finger into her tight vaginal canal, she kissed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be gentle&rdquo;, she said, I knew why, I could feel her hymen within the reach of my index finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to; Clara once it&rsquo;s done there is no going back is there, you love me don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I asked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much it hurts,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I undid my drawstring and lowered my pants and underwear stepping out of them, as I rubbed the head of prick against her cunt. I could feel her juices, thick and creamy; coat the head at the entrance to her canal. I eased the head of my prick inside her opening, as her juices started to flow faster, &ldquo;Ready my sweet Clara&rdquo; and pushed I could feel her tense as her hands gripped my arms, as it parted and I was inside her.</p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears, I kissed her gently on her lips, her cheeks, and eyes as I built a steady rhythm, this was not the fast pace of youth this was the steady love of a lifetime. I now had nearly all my prick buried into her as she leant back I speared up against her womb. Her body started to tense as she came, I was keeping pace with her, she was thrusting back into me; she came, with that beautiful soft shudder of bliss. &ldquo;You ready my darling?&rdquo; I asked, looking at her beaming smile.</p>
<p>Anna asked, &ldquo;Are you OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so&rdquo; I backed out and picked up the stroke, Clara was coming again as with one final push I unloaded deep within her, coating the back recesses of her vaginal canal with my fresh, creamy cum. She came with one last shudder her breasts pressed against my chest. &ldquo;I love you?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Her eyes opened wide &ldquo;you said&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped that question with a kiss, &ldquo;Am I in love with you, no but that my Darling will grow through the years, I will treat you with Love, respect&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I ask from you in return is to love me back. As for children, I will have as many as you want to have my dear one. One thing with our kids though Clara they are going to one of two things remarkably good looking, or they are going to need a dowry the size of Everest, to get them a date&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I started laughing as I hugged her and held her to my chest, as we laughed together. You don&rsquo;t mind sharing me do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max, she said kissing me hard, you are the same as Vegemite a little bit is good, too much not so appetizing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As we, both laughed again. Anna handed us a clean towel and washer. I wiped Clara&rsquo;s Pussy and mound it had a red tinge. I inquired, &ldquo;Do I need to mail this to your Uncle?&rdquo; She hit me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No but you will need to ring him in the morning, he is up early&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK. I said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay there&rdquo; I said as I wiped her thighs. I put my face and buried my tongue into her Pussy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; said Clara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to&rdquo; I said, as I started to lick through the thick matt of her hair I sucked on her clit, which was peeking out of the undergrowth. I sucked, nibbled, licked, and once again rewarded with Clara shuddering and cumming again. I licked her once more, and kissed her on the lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will need to get the lawn trimmed my darling and get rid of those damn uniforms they are hideous; you didn&rsquo;t pick them did you. God no wonder you guys just wear black all the time.&rdquo; Even Anna laughed at that. The look when she saw the blood on the washer was priceless.</p>
<p>Clara she just glowed, her eyes sparkled her smile beamed out a mile wide, &ldquo;You are beautiful, look at you&rdquo; I said as I helped her up and put on her knickers.</p>
<p>As she saw herself in the mirror, she looked at me and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked, &ldquo;Why, is that me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara just looked at Anna &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t have a clue does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope&rdquo; said Anna tidying up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a reflection of you silly; you can&rsquo;t stay unhappy, with you around Max&rdquo;. Clara said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh one thing Clara you called me Max Black no one&rsquo;s called me that for ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what my Aunt called you when she told stories about you&rdquo; Clara replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Aunt Lady Morgan I&rsquo;ve never met her,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Clara replied saying, &ldquo;You knew her as Margarita Zigaronski, Lady Paul Morgan Is Ziggys sister Margie&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh shit, she was married to some Polish Mine engineer up in the Kimberly&rsquo;s, they were having some major dramas, and she left him, taking her two boys. They stayed over with us&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max you didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well she left him, and Ziggy was drunk and I was lonely and horny and, she was truly lovely, not pretty, just funny and smart, You Know me Anna, brain first, body second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara asked, &ldquo;Did you love her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so, which amounts to the same thing she was older, way smarter, when I woke up in the morning she had already gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened said Anna, what did you say to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he was a fuckwit, and if he didn&rsquo;t want her, Id marry her in a heartbeat, and I think it was her parents, wrong side of the tracks not good enough that sought of crap I don&rsquo;t know what happened, she left and Ziggy went to work at another Mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to know Max?&rdquo; she said. I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Margie went back to where he was working, told him was a fuckwit, and gave him back his ring. and said she had found someone younger, and extremely smart, he told her how much he loved her, stayed married had 5 kids, still together, Oh if she has an argument with Paul she reminds him he was second choice&rdquo; said Clara looking at Anna breaking up laughing.</p>
<p>I was putting on my pants when the door opened &ldquo;Oh sorry&rdquo; said Doctor Redman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up Doc?&rdquo; I asked &ldquo;No problems I hope&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s all fine thank you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara, do you have Professor Barnard Home phone number on file?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Russel Barnard&rdquo; said Doc Redman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his first name Anna&rsquo;s son does research at the Uni Why?&rdquo; I asked it was now 11.50pm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to ring him this hour of the night surely, he won&rsquo;t be happy,&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc, if someone rang you at 12.00pm and said I&rsquo;m going to give you $120 Million would you be unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor looked stunned, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going to give him $120 Million what for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For research Doctor, or Bingo, Tatts, whatever, Why?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I worked with him, and he&rsquo;s just going round in circles and besides he&rsquo;s lost his Funding with the University,&rdquo; he said sounding upset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah your wrong Doctor It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;s lost, he just doesn&rsquo;t know what to look for, I am going to steer him on the right track, besides who knows what he might find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you reckon I would need to build a state of the art research facility where the school is going?&rdquo; I asked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With, or without, Nuclear Medicine?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May as well have the lot,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would Budget $150 million give or take $20 Million with cyclotrons as well&rdquo; said Clara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep I will have to buy Grammar and extend it, so if I run out of money in the mean time could you lend me some,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Max how about I give you $400 for a start,&rdquo; she said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do nicely Thank you sweetheart,&rdquo; I said giving her a kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh sorry Doctor Redman, Clara Madjakowski soon to be, Does Adams work for you darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara Nodded.</p>
<p>Clara owns the hospital, and she&rsquo;s the niece of Sir Paul and Lady Morgan, Oh and that&rsquo;s not $400 dollars, Doc that&rsquo;s $400 Million Dollars do you have Professor Redman&rsquo;s Number, yes, brilliant I&rsquo;ll ring him Now, Thankyou&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Redman started to say, &ldquo;I believe I owe you,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara cut him off, &ldquo;Its Fine Doctor Really we have all been under a great deal of stress&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I believe My Fianc&rdquo;, she smiled as she looked at Anna. &ldquo;You Doctor will be working with Professor Barnard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is going to run the Hospital?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anna&rdquo; said Clara looking straight at Anna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me said Anna, why me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said Clara you get things done with typical German efficiency, the Staff like you, Max adores you, and anyone who Max adores can&rsquo;t be that bad. Just don&rsquo;t start putting people up chimneys, the pollution controls are horrendous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anna and Doctor Redman looked at Clara in Horror &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jewish we say it its Funny, you say that It&rsquo;s a Lawsuit&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh said Clara you sure Max is not Jewish, his sense of humour it so Black. I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Barnard was wide-awake, his wife Jenny had made a cup of tea for them, and I was bouncing ideas from my head at the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you believe that Cancer cells are already in your body all the Time,&rdquo; he said sounding indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s absurd&rdquo;. He said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, where do they come from?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mutate from healthy cells&rdquo;, yes point taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why some cells do becomes cancerous, and the same type of cell doesn&rsquo;t. It never made sense to me,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What didn&rsquo;t make sense?&rdquo; said the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normal cells one minute you&rsquo;re all OK; next they turn into cancer cells, it just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>The professor went quite &ldquo;Russell it&rsquo;s sought of like the early humans. Homo Habilis to Modern man It was once thought they evolved separately from each other wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes that&rsquo;s correct&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now in the last 5 years or so with the advances in genetics, the general theory is they all evolved together intermingling genes?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That turned that initial theory on its head, you had some involvement with that didn&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I played a part in that yes.&rdquo; He replied smugly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I knew that first theory was wrong, at age 9,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You knew that first theory was wrong at age 9. How in heavens name could you have known that?&rdquo; he replied sounding upset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just never made sense to me Russell, Neanderthal Guy Sees Cro-Magnon Girl, You get the picture, I said as much to the teacher, and got thrown out of class&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how, why&rdquo; he said stuttering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have what you might call an enquiring mind, well that&rsquo;s my Aunt called it that anyway; I see things that other people overlook, I once did an intelligence test I got 138?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of,&rdquo; said the professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so to, as I only did half the test,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo;, said Russell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is how it&rsquo;s going to work, you work for me, I point in the direction I would like you to go, you spend a bucket load going there, we see the results, that&rsquo;s if you still want to, do you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good I thought so, Are you still tied to the University regards funding?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes he said till October then I runs out&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happens then&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look for a new job&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well that makes this easy then do you have contacts with the other research team in the US doing similar research?&rdquo; I asked him. &ldquo;Yes Why?&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well you can assist them in their research, while I build you a brand spanking new $150 Mill Research Facility including a cyclotron&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s if you want me to, do you.&rdquo; &lsquo;Yes, does that still include the $120 Mill research grant your offering, would I have to Take that to the Americans?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;ll give you $50 Mill, so you can go and play with them Russel&rdquo; I said Laughing, Knowing never to stand between a scientist and a pile of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they will let you come and play?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit yea,&rdquo; he said Laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they might&rdquo; I replied laughing back. &ldquo;The Facility is going to be up here in Hastings, so I can keep an eye on it, it&rsquo;s not too far from where you live, I&rsquo;ll chuck in a house as well, and that&rsquo;s not a problem is it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, we go there a lot, it&rsquo;s really lovely,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you like my little part of the world, I want the Americans in on this as well, and I&rsquo;ll tell you why, I have an electrical background, and the quickest way to find a problem is to have someone, at each end, looking for the fault?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, the research results?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Russell a shared Nobel Prize is better than no, Nobel Prize, wouldn&rsquo;t you say,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are talking Nobel Prizes, and we haven&rsquo;t even started up yet&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you don&rsquo;t think you can do it Russell, That&rsquo;s not what Willie Schmitt,&rdquo; said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start wimping out on me now big guy,&rdquo; I said laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure aim high,&rdquo; said the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well what&rsquo;s the point of turning up to play if you&rsquo;re not there to fucking win, Russel, Look if you don&rsquo;t want it give it to me OK&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;m sure I could find room on my Mantle for it,&rdquo; he said. Clara stood alongside looking at her watch. &ldquo;Oh Id Like Ian Redman to be your Research Director, to handle all the paper work involved if that&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would he be involved in any findings or results if any?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes he would if he assists you in your research, personally I think its Enzymatic based, sought of cause and effect, and Russell, if that&rsquo;s the case, you know what that means don&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need to make space on your mantle place,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would understand, goodnight, Oh Jenny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Max.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can put this bluntly, fuck his brains out and let him go to sleep or he will be up all night&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that and order,&rdquo; She said laughing&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No just a request, oh one more thing before the fun begins, If you have any Dramas with a working Visa, let me Know my Brother is a US Senator, Henry William Adams Jr. Democrat Senator for New York State, Now for queen and country do your duty,&rdquo; I said laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard Max, Russell, do your duty. Night Max.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night Guys and Thanks Bye,&rdquo; I said hanging up.</p>
<p>Clara stood staring at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Up&rdquo; I said looking at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max who is your father&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max just answers the question?&rdquo; Clara replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Henry William Adams USMC Ret, Former Senator for New York State, Why&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you talked to your brother lately asked Clara &ldquo;You might need to give him a ring darling but not now, go to bed, I stood to give her kiss?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get frisky, Anna and I have work to do and you look exhausted, just give me a Kiss,&rdquo; said Clara.</p>
<p>I gave her a Kiss a real toe curler, &ldquo;That should keep you awake,&rdquo; I laughed.</p>
<p>Clara just smiled &ldquo;I love you Max Adams now goes, please; there is room in with Allison, Scoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anna stuck her head out the door &ldquo;Go&rdquo; was all she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we still on for your Tuesday Ravishing?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max promised to Ravish me on Tuesday&rdquo; said Anna.</p>
<p>Clara looked at me &ldquo;Tuesday works, I&rsquo;ve got Meetings most of the day, your good to go, Now GO&rdquo; I just went.</p>
<p>As I walked down the hall to Allison&rsquo;s room my phone, rang, luckily I had set it Vibrate, incoming private number. &ldquo;Max Adams speaking,&rdquo; I said ducking into a corridor that led to the outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lionel Wolfe sorry to call so late, are you able to talk&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lionel will do Max, I just called to say thank you for all your efforts regarding my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must admit I was a bit hard on some of the member especially Katie and Troy&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two that needed it the most Garry is extremely appreciative, of your efforts&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to be of assistance, Katie how can I say this can be a bit Forceful?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what they are calling it now days, in my day it was called being a fucking bitch, and I was so looking forward to the superglue&rdquo; he replied laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it would have held her?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not&rdquo; he said laughing louder still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is late so I will get right to the heart of the matter, your daughter Lauren&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could finish I said, &ldquo;How much do you need to take her of my hands&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wanted to ask you about, actually, he said laughing I would like her to come to Melbourne after her exams, and I will train her up and give a division of my company to run&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to train her up to run a division of your company?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes and once I feel she is ready to run its all hers?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I asked &ldquo;What to Run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Max it&rsquo;s hers as in hers to have&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, and how big a division are we talking about?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queensland, and If she is anything like her father she should do alright&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How big is the Queensland division Finance wise?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last financial review I was approximately 3.8 Billion gives or take, why&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s lucky you picked Lauren because if you had picked Holly her younger sister she would have taken the whole fucking company,&rdquo; I said laughing.</p>
<p>I could hear him laughing loudly at the other end &ldquo;Why is she that tough is she?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5 ft 2&rdquo; tall and all of it trouble, the only two criteria for Holly is Rich and a 12&rdquo; plus prick&rdquo; I said laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good to see she has her priorities worked out how old is she if you don&rsquo;t mind me asking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;12 going on 30&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch I must be getting old&rdquo;, he replied laughing, &ldquo;Lauren would have to married to Troy&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea that&rsquo;s pretty much a given&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to ring her if I may, to discuss it with her, and her Mum and Dad?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck with that&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That awful&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No just a bit of black humour needless to say Holly takes after her Mother, Not Lauren,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh thanks for the warning, and her dad?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been together for 20 years, and he loves her more now than at the start,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice to hear he must be a good bloke,&rdquo; said Lionel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my best mate, he even allows me to knock her up for him,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does what,&rdquo; said Lionel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had cancer of the balls 17 years ago they took both, it&rsquo;s a tough job but someone&rsquo;s got to do it,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we have mates, Max,&rdquo; said Lionel laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is,&rdquo; I said as I gave him Laurens Number, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to bed buddy, Big Day&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks Max.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome Lionel goodnight, bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I walked back down the corridor to check on Barney, the female SC was still there. &ldquo;I thought you went home&rdquo;, I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sgt Stanley thought I had better stay, when he&rsquo;s told in the morning, he won&rsquo;t be happy will he&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not, I don&rsquo;t know how he will react he&rsquo;s a funny little bugger our Barney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s pretty special isn&rsquo;t he&rdquo;, she said looking at him sleeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a shame a man like that alone&rdquo; then realising what she had said she blushed.</p>
<p>I looked at her and asked, &ldquo;You heard me talking to the Doctor didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She just nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Karen&rdquo; I Said, After looking at her name badge Senior Constable Karen Barlow, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put in a good word for you&rdquo;, as I covered her with a blanket, and kissed her on the cheek.</p>
<p>She looked at me and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d even share him if he wanted to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what, he would be silly not to&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, get some sleep OK Nite&rdquo; and went into Allison&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>I went to the toilet and had a quick shower to freshen up, I put on the Hospital pyjamas that they had put out for me and lay back in the arm chair with a blanket over me.&quot;</p>
<p>Allison saw me on the chair &ldquo;Hop in next to me silly you&rsquo;ll wreck your back, there&rsquo;s plenty of room in the bed&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure, I&rsquo;ll just check your all OK first&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nurse has just been in and checked it all for me, I feel like a VIP,&rdquo; she said smiling. I climbed into bed alongside &ldquo;Cuddle me!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so silly sometimes Max,&rdquo; she said kissing me on the cheek. &ldquo;How many times have we all snuggled together to keep warm when competing at carnivals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but I was lusting after your body,&rdquo; I said as we cuddled back to front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you comfy?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love you too, Ally Cat, sweet dreams&rdquo;, as she turned off the light and we went to sleep.</p>
