  "articleBody": "It was fucking ‘parent’s evening’ at Hannah’s school, and Sean never liked it. This was where one or both of the child’s parents (if she had two) were expected to go to the school and chat to her class teacher, and maybe other staff, about her. Her academic progress over the term would be reviewed, as would her general behaviour or even health if appropriate. This was common enough for any parent or guardian, but for a pedo-guardian like Sean the dangers were obvious. Any sensible pedo hated things like this, and as a rule he kept them to a minimum, maintaining a low profile for himself and the child he was molesting - in this case, 9-year-old Hannah. It was not wise to avoid them altogether, though, because that in itself could set alarm bells ringing. Furthermore, it was good to keep some sort of tabs on her life at school. If nothing else, hopefully it would bring reassurance that Hannah was indeed keeping her mouth shut about the things she did at home. Another important point for Sean was to try to make sure he himself attended, rather then Hannah’s world-weary mother, Michelle. It was a matter of being in control, always.\nOn this day, as he strolled through the school gates alongside other parents dribbling in, Sean was pretty sure Hannah had said nothing so far. Hell, if she had, he would not be freely coming to the school! He felt he had pretty well impressed upon the child never to talk to anyone about their goings-on at home - *those* goings-on, that is - and Hannah knew well enough what he meant. She was not to mention it to any teacher or adult helper, and not to her classmates either. She was at that age when she had a notion that it was ‘wrong’, or at least ’not normal’, so it was best to be direct with her about the need to shut up. At 9, they usually still easily bowed to instruction and were easily afraid and very niave, despite this awakening morality. In a few years it might not be so easy, when she gets it into her head she does not HAVE to have a big cock pushed into her anus or vagina. On the other hand, she may grow into a ruined slut who just accepts it or even wants it. Only time would tell, but that was for the future. Sean took things as they came, and just tried to keep things ‘secure’ for the moment, until such time as he felt it was best to move on to a fresh location and a fresh girl.\nIt was a pleasant June evening as he knocked on the door of the private little room allocated for Hannah’s teacher, Mr Daniel Hall, at St Luke’s Primary School. Sean took a slow, relaxed breath, as he knocked on the door and prepared himself for ‘regular guy’ mode.\n“Sean Davis,” he said, as Hall opened the door.\n“Ah, yes, come in Sean,” said Hall. He had a slight air of there being ‘an issue’, but that could be anything from lousy Maths results or bad behaviour. “Take a seat.”\n“Thanks.”\n“So, Sean, you’re the stepfather of Hannah Simpson?”\n“Not legally step-father, no. The live-in boyfriend of her mother.” He always like to put it simply and bluntly, it was a good way to size a person out.\n“Ah, I see. Okay, well that’s fine.” There was a reassuring tone in Hall’s voice for some reason. He was just over 30, and had only been in teaching for about 6 years, and was a quite good-looking guy with glasses.\n“I’ve lived with them for 18 months now, and I take responsibility for quite a lot of stuff with her. Her mother works shifts, so can’t get to these things so easily.”\n“I see, yes. That’s no problem, none at all. Anyway, let’s begin…” Mr Hall then outlined Hannah’s progress in her subjects for this term, after insisting to be called ‘Dan’. Sean quite liked him, despite there being something edgy about him. And then it came. “I’m just a little bit concerned, though.”\n“Oh?”\n“Her work isn’t great, but not terrible. She’s quite a bright girl, who could do better, as I said.”\n“Yup.”\n“It’s her behaviour… well, not so much ‘behaviour’, even, but…”\n“Yeah?” Sean guessed what he was getting at well enough. He pictured Hannah’s dour and pretty face in class, with that kind of distant look she often has - the kind of ’emotional flatness’ behind those deep blue eyes.\n“Her ‘demeanour’, I guess, is what I mean.”\n“What about it?”\n“I get the impression she is not totally happy.”\nFUCK.\n“Not totally? How do you mean? What makes you say that?”\n“She seems glum, sometimes. ‘Vulnerable’, maybe?”\nSHIT. He was on to it. Sean shrugged. “It’s how she is. She’s been affected by never knowing her real Dad, I think.”\n“Ah, yes, no doubt.”\n“You think there’s something else?” It was time to act defensive, indignant even.\n“Maybe, yes. Like… is she being bullied perhaps? I’ve certainly seen no sign of that at school.”\n“She does get picked on in our street a bit, and also does not like…” Sean was about to say she doesn’t like her mother working shifts, but that was too close to the truth: Hannah had good reason not to like that.\n“You were going to say?”\n“Nothing. Doesn’t matter.”\n“Hey, I want to reassure you, Sean. I’m not accusing you of anything.”\n“Good.” Sean smiled, where outrage might have been a more appropriate response, but something told him to relax with this guy.\n“I almost regret raising the issue, really.” Dan shrugged, and seemed to choose his next words carefully. “It’s just that Hannah is one of my favourites, she’s a lovely girl.”\nSean took a moment to gauge that remark. “Yes, she is a lovely girl.”\nThe two men looked each other in the eye, with something not far from ’terror’ in Dan’s, extreme wariness in Sean’s. “She’s ‘very’ lovely. You could say… I have a special interest in her.”\n“Special? How special?” asked Sean. Dan was clearly unsure what to say next. “As special as mine, do you think?”\nDan took a vital second to reply. “I hope so.”\nSean measured his words. “Well, Dan, before we go any further with this conversation I’d like some ‘proof’ from you as to your ‘special interest’.” It was inspirational from Sean: from being in a possible trap, he’d now put Dan in one.\n“Proof? Um, and what would constitute that, if I take your meaning?”\n“I think you do take my meaning. Well, a ‘picture’ of some kind in your possession?”\n“Ah. Okay, okay… I’ll show you a picture… but of course I can always deny I showed it.”\n“Of course.”\nWith some hesitation, but a kind of resolve, Dan took a memory stick from his keyring and put it into his laptop. After a couple of clicks, he turned the screen round for Sean to see. Behold: there was a big video-still of the world famous girl-child, ‘Nicky’, on it, in one of the situations she was famous for - sucking an erect penis. She was standing, stooped over it a little, while the man had his hand on the back of her head.\n“Jeez,” said Sean. “Okay. That’s proof.”\n“I’m glad you think so.”\n“I think she was 9 in that vid, wasn’t she?”\n“Yes, one of the earlier ones.”\n“Hellish cute,” said Sean.\n“Very. You’ll understand if I close it up now?”\n“Yes, get rid of the fucking thing.”\n“She actually looked kind of like Hannah, don’t you think?”\n“Yes, a lot. It’s one reason I like Hannah…” Suddenly Sean realised he’d all but ‘confessed’, and tried to mentally adjust to the new truth about Mr Dan hall.\n“So,” said Dan, earnestly. “DO you?”\n“Do I what? ‘Enjoy’ her?” Sean hated the word, ‘abuse’.\n“Yes. ‘Enjoy’ her. ‘Use’ her?”\n“Okay, I’ll be frank. Yes, I sexually have fun with Hannah, very regularly. Okay?”\nThey looked at each other squarely. There was seriousness on Dan’s face, but not the accusational type. “Wow,” he simply said.\n“Wow?” echoed Sean. “So… you ‘approve’?”\n“I… ‘sympathize’. Whether I approve or not, depends.”\n“On what?”\n“On how ‘sensibly’ you do it. On your situation, and on how… let’s say… ‘rough’ you are on her.”\n“Okay. Well, I do it ‘sensibly’. It’s a discrete and viable situation. And I’m not particularly ‘rough’, in that I don’t go out to be rough with her. It’s not about hurting her, it’s just about ’enjoying’ her, as you put it.”\n“Good.”\n“So, the treatment of her is important to you?” asked Hall.\n“Yes. You see… well, I’m a teacher, after all.” He managed an ironic laugh, and Sean chuckled too. “I do have a true devotion and love of children, more than just sex, and do not want to hurt any.”\n“I don’t doubt it, Dan.”\nDan smiled, sweating a little. “I’m sexually interested, yes - I mean they’re so bloody cute!”\n“Quite.” Sean reckoned both their minds were on Hannah’s unblemished round face at that moment, and the exquisite height, weight and figure - or lack of them - she possessed as a prime specimin of a 9-year-old.\n“I’ve wanted one as long as I can remember, but my trouble is I don’t want to harm any.”\n“That’s good. You’re a good guy, but the question is…”\n“What?”\n“Where does that leave us? You and me, now?”\n“Oh, well, rest-assured, I am not going to tell anything of what I know about you and Hannah.”\n“Just so long as I don’t get REALLY nasty with her, huh?”\nDan chuckled. “Well, yes, I guess.”\n“Actually, I thought you might blackmail me for an opportunity to get your hands on Hannah yourself.” Sean laughed.\n“Oh, haha. God, no, that’s not my style.”\n“You wouldn’t have to, anyway,” said Sean.\n“Why??”\n“Because I’m inviting you to have a piece of her.” There was a heavy silence. “A ‘figure of speech’, you know?”\n“Uh, yes, I know…”\n“So?”\n“So?” echoed Dan.\n“So, would you like to get quite regular access to Hannah yourself, in a discrete setting?” Sean felt this was a well-judged risk, and even safer to have the guy ‘involved’. Besides, he’d always liked the idea of a like-minded buddy on board, and Dan was more or less his ’level’ of pedo, it seemed: not a sadist, although a bit more sentimental than Sean it seemed. “Hey, I realise you don’t want to hurt any for real, so feel free to say no.”\nDan took a deep breath, leaned back, and closed his eyes for a moment. “Shit, I’m getting hard. Um, the answer is… ‘yes’.”\n“Wow,” said Sean. “Good.”\n“My thinking is…” It looked kind of amusing, the way Dan was clearly wrestling with his guilt. “Is this… I mean she’s already ‘damaged’ in essence, based on what you’ve already been doing with her, so…”\n“You don’t know exactly what I’ve been doing with her!” Sean adopted a humourous tone.\n“Uh, no, but I assume…”\n“Pretty much everything,” said Sean.\nUh, yes, that’s what I was gonna guess. Anyway, so, she’s already ‘damaged’, so there’s no real risk I’d be hurting her any more than she already is.\"\n“That’s sound reasoning,” said Sean, understandingly.\n“I’m glad you agree.”\n“Well, I suggest we stop the conversation here.”\n“Yes, that’s wise. This room is well sound-proof, but it’s not the safest thing.”\n“I’ll text you through a day and a time for you to pay a visit to us, and we’ll take it from there, okay?”\n“Okay.” Dan mopped his brow, and stood up.\n“Done deal,” said Sean, extending a hand to shake.\n“Deal,” said Dan, swallowing to regain his professional composure.\n“I’ll be in touch.” With that, Sean turned to go out. “I’m glad her work is not too bad, by the way.”\nDan - well, ‘Mr Hall’ - chuckled, taken aback by the humour. “Yes, uh, good.”\n“By the way…” said Sean, quietly.\n“Yes?”\n“She’s got a beautiful little bum.” He winked at Dan.\n“Oh, fuck,” Dan signed. “Well, don’t I know - I’ve seen it every day in school, ‘clothed’, that is!”\n“Well, I see it UNCLOTHED a lot, and believe me it’s nice.”\n“I don’t doubt it.”\n“Bye for now, then.”\nSean closed the door behind him, getting a last glimpse of Mr Dan Hall looking in a bit of a daze.\nTHE END\n",

He felt he had pretty well impressed upon the child never to talk to anyone about their goings-on at home - *those* goings-on, that is - and Hannah knew well enough what he meant. She was not to mention it to any teacher or adult helper, and not to her classmates either. She was at that age when she had a notion that it was &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;, or at least &rsquo;not normal&rsquo;, so it was best to be direct with her about the need to shut up. At 9, they usually still easily bowed to instruction and were easily afraid and very niave, despite this awakening morality. In a few years it might not be so easy, when she gets it into her head she does not HAVE to have a big cock pushed into her anus or vagina. On the other hand, she may grow into a ruined slut who just accepts it or even wants it. Only time would tell, but that was for the future. Sean took things as they came, and just tried to keep things &lsquo;secure&rsquo; for the moment, until such time as he felt it was best to move on to a fresh location and a fresh girl.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant June evening as he knocked on the door of the private little room allocated for Hannah&rsquo;s teacher, Mr Daniel Hall, at St Luke&rsquo;s Primary School. Sean took a slow, relaxed breath, as he knocked on the door and prepared himself for &lsquo;regular guy&rsquo; mode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sean Davis,&rdquo; he said, as Hall opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, come in Sean,&rdquo; said Hall. He had a slight air of there being &lsquo;an issue&rsquo;, but that could be anything from lousy Maths results or bad behaviour. &ldquo;Take a seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Sean, you&rsquo;re the stepfather of Hannah Simpson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not legally step-father, no. The live-in boyfriend of her mother.&rdquo; He always like to put it simply and bluntly, it was a good way to size a person out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see. Okay, well that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; There was a reassuring tone in Hall&rsquo;s voice for some reason. He was just over 30, and had only been in teaching for about 6 years, and was a quite good-looking guy with glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived with them for 18 months now, and I take responsibility for quite a lot of stuff with her. Her mother works shifts, so can&rsquo;t get to these things so easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, yes. That&rsquo;s no problem, none at all. Anyway, let&rsquo;s begin&hellip;&rdquo; Mr Hall then outlined Hannah&rsquo;s progress in her subjects for this term, after insisting to be called &lsquo;Dan&rsquo;. Sean quite liked him, despite there being something edgy about him. And then it came. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a little bit concerned, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her work isn&rsquo;t great, but not terrible. She&rsquo;s quite a bright girl, who could do better, as I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her behaviour&hellip; well, not so much &lsquo;behaviour&rsquo;, even, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Sean guessed what he was getting at well enough. He pictured Hannah&rsquo;s dour and pretty face in class, with that kind of distant look she often has - the kind of &rsquo;emotional flatness&rsquo; behind those deep blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her &lsquo;demeanour&rsquo;, I guess, is what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get the impression she is not totally happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FUCK.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not totally? How do you mean? What makes you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems glum, sometimes. &lsquo;Vulnerable&rsquo;, maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>SHIT. He was on to it. Sean shrugged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s how she is. She&rsquo;s been affected by never knowing her real Dad, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think there&rsquo;s something else?&rdquo; It was time to act defensive, indignant even.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, yes. Like&hellip; is she being bullied perhaps? I&rsquo;ve certainly seen no sign of that at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does get picked on in our street a bit, and also does not like&hellip;&rdquo; Sean was about to say she doesn&rsquo;t like her mother working shifts, but that was too close to the truth: Hannah had good reason not to like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were going to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, I want to reassure you, Sean. I&rsquo;m not accusing you of anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Sean smiled, where outrage might have been a more appropriate response, but something told him to relax with this guy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost regret raising the issue, really.&rdquo; Dan shrugged, and seemed to choose his next words carefully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that Hannah is one of my favourites, she&rsquo;s a lovely girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sean took a moment to gauge that remark. &ldquo;Yes, she is a lovely girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men looked each other in the eye, with something not far from &rsquo;terror&rsquo; in Dan&rsquo;s, extreme wariness in Sean&rsquo;s. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s &lsquo;very&rsquo; lovely. You could say&hellip; I have a special interest in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Special? How special?&rdquo; asked Sean. Dan was clearly unsure what to say next. &ldquo;As special as mine, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan took a vital second to reply. &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sean measured his words. &ldquo;Well, Dan, before we go any further with this conversation I&rsquo;d like some &lsquo;proof&rsquo; from you as to your &lsquo;special interest&rsquo;.&rdquo; It was inspirational from Sean: from being in a possible trap, he&rsquo;d now put Dan in one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proof? Um, and what would constitute that, if I take your meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you do take my meaning. Well, a &lsquo;picture&rsquo; of some kind in your possession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah. Okay, okay&hellip; I&rsquo;ll show you a picture&hellip; but of course I can always deny I showed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With some hesitation, but a kind of resolve, Dan took a memory stick from his keyring and put it into his laptop. After a couple of clicks, he turned the screen round for Sean to see. Behold: there was a big video-still of the world famous girl-child, &lsquo;Nicky&rsquo;, on it, in one of the situations she was famous for - sucking an erect penis. She was standing, stooped over it a little, while the man had his hand on the back of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeez,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;Okay. That&rsquo;s proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she was 9 in that vid, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, one of the earlier ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hellish cute,&rdquo; said Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very. You&rsquo;ll understand if I close it up now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, get rid of the fucking thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She actually looked kind of like Hannah, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a lot. It&rsquo;s one reason I like Hannah&hellip;&rdquo; Suddenly Sean realised he&rsquo;d all but &lsquo;confessed&rsquo;, and tried to mentally adjust to the new truth about Mr Dan hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Dan, earnestly. &ldquo;DO you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I what? &lsquo;Enjoy&rsquo; her?&rdquo; Sean hated the word, &lsquo;abuse&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. &lsquo;Enjoy&rsquo; her. &lsquo;Use&rsquo; her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll be frank. Yes, I sexually have fun with Hannah, very regularly. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other squarely. There was seriousness on Dan&rsquo;s face, but not the accusational type. &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he simply said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow?&rdquo; echoed Sean. &ldquo;So&hellip; you &lsquo;approve&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip; &lsquo;sympathize&rsquo;. Whether I approve or not, depends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On how &lsquo;sensibly&rsquo; you do it. On your situation, and on how&hellip; let&rsquo;s say&hellip; &lsquo;rough&rsquo; you are on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Well, I do it &lsquo;sensibly&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a discrete and viable situation. And I&rsquo;m not particularly &lsquo;rough&rsquo;, in that I don&rsquo;t go out to be rough with her. It&rsquo;s not about hurting her, it&rsquo;s just about &rsquo;enjoying&rsquo; her, as you put it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, the treatment of her is important to you?&rdquo; asked Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You see&hellip; well, I&rsquo;m a teacher, after all.&rdquo; He managed an ironic laugh, and Sean chuckled too. &ldquo;I do have a true devotion and love of children, more than just sex, and do not want to hurt any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan smiled, sweating a little. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sexually interested, yes - I mean they&rsquo;re so bloody cute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo; Sean reckoned both their minds were on Hannah&rsquo;s unblemished round face at that moment, and the exquisite height, weight and figure - or lack of them - she possessed as a prime specimin of a 9-year-old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted one as long as I can remember, but my trouble is I don&rsquo;t want to harm any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. You&rsquo;re a good guy, but the question is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does that leave us? You and me, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, rest-assured, I am not going to tell anything of what I know about you and Hannah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so long as I don&rsquo;t get REALLY nasty with her, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan chuckled. &ldquo;Well, yes, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, I thought you might blackmail me for an opportunity to get your hands on Hannah yourself.&rdquo; Sean laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, haha. God, no, that&rsquo;s not my style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have to, anyway,&rdquo; said Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why??&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m inviting you to have a piece of her.&rdquo; There was a heavy silence. &ldquo;A &lsquo;figure of speech&rsquo;, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, yes, I know&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; echoed Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, would you like to get quite regular access to Hannah yourself, in a discrete setting?&rdquo; Sean felt this was a well-judged risk, and even safer to have the guy &lsquo;involved&rsquo;. Besides, he&rsquo;d always liked the idea of a like-minded buddy on board, and Dan was more or less his &rsquo;level&rsquo; of pedo, it seemed: not a sadist, although a bit more sentimental than Sean it seemed. &ldquo;Hey, I realise you don&rsquo;t want to hurt any for real, so feel free to say no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan took a deep breath, leaned back, and closed his eyes for a moment. &ldquo;Shit, I&rsquo;m getting hard. Um, the answer is&hellip; &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thinking is&hellip;&rdquo; It looked kind of amusing, the way Dan was clearly wrestling with his guilt. &ldquo;Is this&hellip; I mean she&rsquo;s already &lsquo;damaged&rsquo; in essence, based on what you&rsquo;ve already been doing with her, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know exactly what I&rsquo;ve been doing with her!&rdquo; Sean adopted a humourous tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, no, but I assume&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty much everything,&rdquo; said Sean.</p>
<p>Uh, yes, that&rsquo;s what I was gonna guess. Anyway, so, she&rsquo;s already &lsquo;damaged&rsquo;, so there&rsquo;s no real risk I&rsquo;d be hurting her any more than she already is.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sound reasoning,&rdquo; said Sean, understandingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suggest we stop the conversation here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s wise. This room is well sound-proof, but it&rsquo;s not the safest thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll text you through a day and a time for you to pay a visit to us, and we&rsquo;ll take it from there, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Dan mopped his brow, and stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done deal,&rdquo; said Sean, extending a hand to shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; said Dan, swallowing to regain his professional composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in touch.&rdquo; With that, Sean turned to go out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad her work is not too bad, by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan - well, &lsquo;Mr Hall&rsquo; - chuckled, taken aback by the humour. &ldquo;Yes, uh, good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way&hellip;&rdquo; said Sean, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a beautiful little bum.&rdquo; He winked at Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fuck,&rdquo; Dan signed. &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t I know - I&rsquo;ve seen it every day in school, &lsquo;clothed&rsquo;, that is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I see it UNCLOTHED a lot, and believe me it&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye for now, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sean closed the door behind him, getting a last glimpse of Mr Dan Hall looking in a bit of a daze.</p>
<p>THE END</p>
