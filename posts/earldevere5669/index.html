  "articleBody": "PR2: Friday, September 29, 1978 I was cooking breakfast when Dennie came into the kitchen.\n“Good Morning, Kid,” I said.\n“Good morning, Dad,” she replied sleepily.\nI knew that she knew that I knew that she had watched her mother and I fucking last night, but her behavior and attitude toward me hadn’t changed noticeably. She gave me her usual good morning hug and I gave her the usual kiss on the top of her head. The hug may have lingered a little longer than normal, but that could have been my imagination.\nShe was eating her scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and grits when Kimberly and Veronica came to the house on their way to school and dropped off their overnight bags. Dennie gulped down the rest of her food and went to the bathroom to brush her teeth. Her friends followed. I heard whispering and giggling. One of the girls said, “No! Really?” followed by more whispering and giggling.\nAs the girls walked out of the house, they gave me sidelong glances and giggled.\nWhat did Dennie tell them? I hoped that she only told them that she had watched, not that I knew she was watching.\nFran got up a little after 10, as usual. And, as usual, I had coffee ready for her. We have a morning ritual of sipping our first cup of coffee in silence while meditating on each other’s eyes. I focus on my reflection in her pupil. When she finished her cup and set it aside, I told her about the kids, and about being worried that Dennie may have told them that I knew she was watching while we fucked.\n“You didn’t tell me that you let her know that you knew that she was watching!”\n“I didn’t? I guess I got distracted when you started talking about seducing our daughter. It’s in the Progress Report. You were asleep by the time I finished it.”\nFran immediately got up and went upstairs to my little 6’x6’ office. In Victorian parlance, it was called a trunk room. It was the perfect place for my library/office. Although it was small, it wasn’t claustrophobic. I never closed the door to the hallway, and the floor to ceiling window opened to the porch.\nAbout 15 minutes later, Fran ran back downstairs with the nine page manuscript in hand, “Oh my God,” she exclaimed. “It’s so fucking hot. I’m reading about myself, but it kind of feels like I’m reading about a fictional character. I’m seeing myself through your eyes, and it makes me horny. Fuck me!”\nI picked her up, sat her on the kitchen table and fucked. No foreplay. No hesitation. My cock rammed into her cunt and I pounded away.\n“Yesss! Fuck me! Fuuuck meee!” Her back arched and her body went rigid and vibrated. Then she suddenly relaxed and melted onto the table top. I went directly to her slick semen-inundated vagina, and glutinously imbibed in our mingled lust liqueurs.\n“What girls?”\n“Kimberly and Veronica,” I said. “What if Dennie tells them that I knew that she was watching, and kept on fucking.”\n“I wouldn’t worry about it,” she smiled. “But then I wouldn’t be the one getting gang-banged by syphilitic criminals in a Texas prison.”\n“Thank you for those encouraging words. You really know how to make a guy feel good.”\n“I doubt that she told them the part about you watching the watcher. I doubt that anything will come of it if she did,” Fran said. “Are you going to say anything to her about it?”\n“No. I’m going to wait for her to bring up the subject.”\nFran bathed, dressed and left for work. Damn! She has a sexy ass.\nI tried to work on my great American novel, rewriting the first chapter for the fourth or fifth time, but I couldn’t get my mind off of Dennie, Kimberly and Veronica, and the idea of fucking Fran while they watched. I was lost in that vision when the slamming of the front door snatched me back to real life reality, and I quickly and guiltily covered my rock hard love log.\n“We’re home!” Dennie yelled from the stairway.\nWhen I looked, her eyes were at floor level, looking directly at my hands-covered crotch. She giggled and continued up the stairs with her friends close behind. Dennie threw her arms around my neck and kissed my mouth. The kiss didn’t last much longer than it had the previous night, but it was somehow more sensual. It was probably self delusion on my part. My thoughts about my daughter were much more sensual than they had been the night before.\n“Daddy, can we…MAY we have some ice cream?”\n“What flavor?”\n“Kim! Ronnie! What kind of ice cream do we want?”\nThe girls scrambled into my tiny office. Dennie moved around from my left side to my right. Her arms still encircled my neck. “I vote Chocolate!” Dennie exclaimed.\n“Chocolate!”\n“Chocolate!”\nDennie put her right hand on my left cheek and turned my head until we were nose to nose. “Daddy, I think we want choc…”\n“Rocky Road!” Veronica said.\n“Okay. We want rock ’n’ roll…I mean rocky road.” Dennie giggled and glanced toward my crotch. I realized that my dick was uncovered. Both legs were covered, making my cock even more obvious. It twitched. The girls gasped and giggled.\n“What kind of topping?” I asked, looking at Dennie, who was looking at Veronica and Kimberly.\"\n“Chocolate?” Dennie said.\n“Strawberry!” Kimberly said.\n“I agree,” I said. “Strawberry.” I looked quickly from Dennie to the girls and caught them staring at my rapidly growing penis. It took them a second to realize that I was looking at them. They looked up and blushed brightly. “Oops!” I said, covering up “I apologize ladies. I didn’t realize that I was indecently exposing myself . Please forgive me.”\n“Uh…it’s alright,” Veronica whispered.\nKimberly shrugged her shoulders, “I didn’t mind that much.”\n“And I didn’t really mind y’all staring at it,” I said. “I don’t want y’all to feel embarrassed or awkward about that. It’s natural. I know that I would stare if you ‘accidentally’ exposed yourselves to me.”\n“In your dreams,” Dennie giggled.\n“I’ll get dressed and get us some ice cream. Are y’all coming with me.”\n“We’ll stay here,” Dennie said. “Before you go, could you get blankets and stuff off of the top shelf so we can make a pallet.”\nI had to step up on the lowest shelf and stretch to reach the blankets and comforters on the top shelf. Denise knew that my smoking jacket always fell open when I reached up. Veronica stood to my left and Kimberly stood to my right, obviously anticipating the unveiling of the erection that was already tenting the satin material. I stretched a lot more than was necessary to ensure that the sash would clip loose and the smoking jacket would fall open.\nI paused a long second before closing and retying the garment. “Maybe I had better get dressed before getting the rest of the stuff.”\n“Why?” Dennie asked. “We’ve already seen…it.”\n“Yes,” I said. “But the exposures were accidental. I didn’t flash y’all on purpose, which would constitute the crime of indecent exposure to young girls.”\n“We won’t tell nobody,” Kimberly said.\n“Un unh!” Veronica agreed, shaking her head emphatically.\n“Are you sure?” I asked. “I certainly don’t want to anything to embarrass you or make you feel uncomfortable around me.”\n“It’s okay,” Kimberly said. “I don’t mind.”\n“Yeah, I don’t mind either,” Veronica agreed.\n“You’re sure?”\nBoth girls nodded eagerly.\nAgain, the jacket opened when I reached up, and I left it open while I grabbed blankets and comforters and dropped them to the floor, while watching the girls stare at my hard cock. I made it twitch. The girls giggled and looked up at me. I smiled and winked. I stepped back down onto the floor, facing the girls, and took my time straightening and closing my smoking jacket. Just before closing it, I made my cock twitch twice.\nI went to my room, discarded the smoking jacket and donned my usual off-duty attire; a pair of cutoff jeans, a tropical shirt, an old Panama hat and flip flops. I was nearly out of the front door when I realized that my wallet was in the bedroom. I closed the door and the girls thought that I had left. I took the stairs two at a time, miraculously missing the steps that creaked.\n“No way!” Veronica squealed.\n“No fucking way!” Kimberly agreed. “Ain’t no way your Mom can get all of your Daddy’s big cock in her mouth.”\n“She really did it. All nine inches. All the way to his balls.”\n“Nine inches!?!” Kimberly scoffed. “That mother fucker looks like it’s at least a foot long.”\n“I overheard Mom telling one of her friends that she measured it and that it was nine inches.”\n“She told a friend about it.” Kimberly asked.\n“Mrs. Robinson,” Dennie explained. “They’ve been friends since they were like in the first grade. They talk about men and sex. Mrs. Robinson likes sex but hates men. Her husbands and boyfriends have all been assholes.”\n“You really watched him fuck her and eat her pussy.” Veronica whispered.\n“He ate her before and after fucking,” Dennie giggled.\n“He licked her cunt after he filled it with cum!?!” Kimberly giggled.\n“Ewww!” Veronica exclaimed.\n“Daddy likes it. He calls it eating cream pie. He says it’s his favorite dessert.”\nI made my presence known. “I forgot my wallet,” I said as I walked past Dennie’s open door. “I didn’t mean to interrupt the conversation.” I stuffed the wallet in my back pocket and went back down stairs. I was on the front porch when Dennie caught up with me.\"\n“How much did you hear?” She asked, blushing brightly.\n“Everything after Kimberly said that there was no fucking way that Fran can get all of my big hard cock in her mouth.”\n“You’re not mad?”\n“I guess that I should be, but I’m not. Don’t tell them, but listening to y’all was a bit of a turn-on for me.”\n“You liked it!” she giggled, looking pointedly at my burgeoning bulge.\n“Don’t tell,” I asked. “Anyway, they now know they don’t have to watch their language around me. They can talk like they would when no adults are around.”\n“You’re not mad at me for watching?”\n“This has to be a secret between you and me.”\n“Okay.”\n“I loved you watching. It’s a turn-on,” I said. “Don’t tell anyone.”\n“I won’t.”\nI walked two block to the nearest convenience store, wishing that I had bugged Dennie’s room. I got a gallon of Rocky Road and a jar of strawberry topping. I wrapped the carton in plastic and two paper bags to hold in the cold.\n“I’m home,” I yelled as I opened the front door.\nDennie charged down the stairs. Her friends balked at the top, blushing.\nI proceeded to the kitchen, where I opened the ice cream and got four bowls from the cabinet.\nKimberly and Veronica entered the kitchen reluctantly, with Dennie pushing them from behind. “Don’t worry. It’s okay,” she whispered.\nI scooped the ice cream into the bowls. “I’ll let you ladies put the topping on yourselves.” I paused. “That would be kinky. I mean I’ll let you put the topping on the ice cream.”\nThere was a brief moment of confusion before Veronica caught on, and had a giggle fit. Dennie and Kimberly quickly caught on.\"\n“Put the topping on ourselves,” Dennie giggled.\nI excused myself, went to the bathroom and jacked off. I ejaculated profusely after about half a dozen strokes. Afterward, I carried my bowl up to my office and began writing this report. As I wrote, my cock tumesced until the head was boldly protruding from my cutoffs’ left leg.\nDennie came up stairs as I was pulling a sheet from my typewriter and laying it aside, upside down.\n“Whatcha writin’?”\n“Uh…a short story.”\n“A sexy short story?” She asked, looking at my cockhead.\n“Yeah. A sexy short story.”\n“You’re writing porn?”\n“Your daddy’s a part time pornographist.”\n“Pornographist?”\n“It sounds classier than pornographer.”\n“Can I read it?”\n“No. I don’t even let your mother read my rough drafts. Maybe after I’ve finished it.”\nDenise whispered, “Don’t tell them I told you, but Kim and Ronnie said that they’d put the strawberry topping on themselves if you’d lick it all off.”\nMy cock lurched at the thought. A drop of precum appeared.\n“What’s that?” she asked, pointing.\n“It called Cowper’s fluid. Most people call it precum,” I said. “It’s really slick, and lubricates the cock for fucking. Girls’ pussies also produce a lubricant. Your pussy gets juicy when you play with it. Doesn’t it.”\nShe blushed and stammered.\n“It’s okay. Everybody plays with themselves. It’s natural.”\n“Yeah, it…my pussy does get juicy when I play with it,” she said.\n“I’ll bet your pussy feels juicy right now.”\nShe blushed, giggled and nodded.\n“Do you and Kimberly and Veronica play with each other?”\nDennie looked shocked.\n“Honey, I’ll tell you anything you want to know about sex or anything else. I want us to be able to talk to each other about anything. But it has to be our secret.”\nShe nodded shyly. “Sometimes we play with each other.”\n“When I was a kid, me and my best friend fooled around some. We played with each other’s cock. We didn’t start until we were 12 or 13. Boys mature sexually later than girls.” I didn’t tell her that Charley and I had only jacked each other off only one time. It was the 1950’s - the post war Victorian Era. We never mentioned it again. I wanted to do it some more, and he probably did too, but homosexually was taboo. No one talked about it, other than slurs, like faggot and cocksucker.\n“Boys are jerks.”\nThe girls came up the stairs. “Don’t say anything about licking strawberry topping off their bodies,” she whispered before walking out of the office and leading them into her bedroom.\nI went into my bedroom, undressed and masturbated again, visualizing naked undeveloped bodies covered with strawberry topping, inviting me to lick it all off. I donned my smoking jacket and returned to the office to resume writing the report.\nI got so involved in the writing that I was unaware of the time, and was surprised when the girls suddenly appeared in the office, wearing their nighties. Dennie wore her usual too small tee shirt and panties.\n“Are you gonna order the pizza, Daddy.”\n",

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Dad,&rdquo; she replied sleepily.</p>
<p>I knew that she knew that I knew that she had watched her mother and I fucking last night, but her behavior and attitude toward me hadn&rsquo;t changed noticeably. She gave me her usual good morning hug and I gave her the usual kiss on the top of her head. The hug may have lingered a little longer than normal, but that could have been my imagination.</p>
<p>She was eating her scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and grits when Kimberly and Veronica came to the house on their way to school and dropped off their overnight bags. Dennie gulped down the rest of her food and went to the bathroom to brush her teeth. Her friends followed. I heard whispering and giggling. One of the girls said, &ldquo;No! Really?&rdquo; followed by more whispering and giggling.</p>
<p>As the girls walked out of the house, they gave me sidelong glances and giggled.</p>
<p>What did Dennie tell them? I hoped that she only told them that she had watched, not that I knew she was watching.</p>
<p>Fran got up a little after 10, as usual. And, as usual, I had coffee ready for her. We have a morning ritual of sipping our first cup of coffee in silence while meditating on each other&rsquo;s eyes. I focus on my reflection in her pupil. When she finished her cup and set it aside, I told her about the kids, and about being worried that Dennie may have told them that I knew she was watching while we fucked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me that you let her know that you knew that she was watching!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t? I guess I got distracted when you started talking about seducing our daughter. It&rsquo;s in the Progress Report. You were asleep by the time I finished it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fran immediately got up and went upstairs to my little 6&rsquo;x6&rsquo; office. In Victorian parlance, it was called a trunk room. It was the perfect place for my library/office. Although it was small, it wasn&rsquo;t claustrophobic. I never closed the door to the hallway, and the floor to ceiling window opened to the porch.</p>
<p>About 15 minutes later, Fran ran back downstairs with the nine page manuscript in hand, &ldquo;Oh my God,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so fucking hot. I&rsquo;m reading about myself, but it kind of feels like I&rsquo;m reading about a fictional character. I&rsquo;m seeing myself through your eyes, and it makes me horny. Fuck me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I picked her up, sat her on the kitchen table and fucked. No foreplay. No hesitation. My cock rammed into her cunt and I pounded away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesss! Fuck me! Fuuuck meee!&rdquo; Her back arched and her body went rigid and vibrated. Then she suddenly relaxed and melted onto the table top. I went directly to her slick semen-inundated vagina, and glutinously imbibed in our mingled lust liqueurs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kimberly and Veronica,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What if Dennie tells them that I knew that she was watching, and kept on fucking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;But then I wouldn&rsquo;t be the one getting gang-banged by syphilitic criminals in a Texas prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for those encouraging words. You really know how to make a guy feel good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt that she told them the part about you watching the watcher. I doubt that anything will come of it if she did,&rdquo; Fran said. &ldquo;Are you going to say anything to her about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going to wait for her to bring up the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fran bathed, dressed and left for work. Damn! She has a sexy ass.</p>
<p>I tried to work on my great American novel, rewriting the first chapter for the fourth or fifth time, but I couldn&rsquo;t get my mind off of Dennie, Kimberly and Veronica, and the idea of fucking Fran while they watched. I was lost in that vision when the slamming of the front door snatched me back to real life reality, and I quickly and guiltily covered my rock hard love log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re home!&rdquo; Dennie yelled from the stairway.</p>
<p>When I looked, her eyes were at floor level, looking directly at my hands-covered crotch. She giggled and continued up the stairs with her friends close behind. Dennie threw her arms around my neck and kissed my mouth. The kiss didn&rsquo;t last much longer than it had the previous night, but it was somehow more sensual. It was probably self delusion on my part. My thoughts about my daughter were much more sensual than they had been the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy, can we&hellip;MAY we have some ice cream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What flavor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kim! Ronnie! What kind of ice cream do we want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls scrambled into my tiny office. Dennie moved around from my left side to my right. Her arms still encircled my neck. &ldquo;I vote Chocolate!&rdquo; Dennie exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chocolate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chocolate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dennie put her right hand on my left cheek and turned my head until we were nose to nose. &ldquo;Daddy, I think we want choc&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rocky Road!&rdquo; Veronica said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. We want rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll&hellip;I mean rocky road.&rdquo; Dennie giggled and glanced toward my crotch. I realized that my dick was uncovered. Both legs were covered, making my cock even more obvious. It twitched. The girls gasped and giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of topping?&rdquo; I asked, looking at Dennie, who was looking at Veronica and Kimberly.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chocolate?&rdquo; Dennie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strawberry!&rdquo; Kimberly said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Strawberry.&rdquo; I looked quickly from Dennie to the girls and caught them staring at my rapidly growing penis. It took them a second to realize that I was looking at them. They looked up and blushed brightly. &ldquo;Oops!&rdquo; I said, covering up &ldquo;I apologize ladies. I didn&rsquo;t realize that I was indecently exposing myself . Please forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;it&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Veronica whispered.</p>
<p>Kimberly shrugged her shoulders, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mind that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t really mind y&rsquo;all staring at it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want y&rsquo;all to feel embarrassed or awkward about that. It&rsquo;s natural. I know that I would stare if you &lsquo;accidentally&rsquo; exposed yourselves to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your dreams,&rdquo; Dennie giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get dressed and get us some ice cream. Are y&rsquo;all coming with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay here,&rdquo; Dennie said. &ldquo;Before you go, could you get blankets and stuff off of the top shelf so we can make a pallet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to step up on the lowest shelf and stretch to reach the blankets and comforters on the top shelf. Denise knew that my smoking jacket always fell open when I reached up. Veronica stood to my left and Kimberly stood to my right, obviously anticipating the unveiling of the erection that was already tenting the satin material. I stretched a lot more than was necessary to ensure that the sash would clip loose and the smoking jacket would fall open.</p>
<p>I paused a long second before closing and retying the garment. &ldquo;Maybe I had better get dressed before getting the rest of the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Dennie asked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already seen&hellip;it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But the exposures were accidental. I didn&rsquo;t flash y&rsquo;all on purpose, which would constitute the crime of indecent exposure to young girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t tell nobody,&rdquo; Kimberly said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Un unh!&rdquo; Veronica agreed, shaking her head emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I certainly don&rsquo;t want to anything to embarrass you or make you feel uncomfortable around me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Kimberly said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t mind either,&rdquo; Veronica agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>Again, the jacket opened when I reached up, and I left it open while I grabbed blankets and comforters and dropped them to the floor, while watching the girls stare at my hard cock. I made it twitch. The girls giggled and looked up at me. I smiled and winked. I stepped back down onto the floor, facing the girls, and took my time straightening and closing my smoking jacket. Just before closing it, I made my cock twitch twice.</p>
<p>I went to my room, discarded the smoking jacket and donned my usual off-duty attire; a pair of cutoff jeans, a tropical shirt, an old Panama hat and flip flops. I was nearly out of the front door when I realized that my wallet was in the bedroom. I closed the door and the girls thought that I had left. I took the stairs two at a time, miraculously missing the steps that creaked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way!&rdquo; Veronica squealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fucking way!&rdquo; Kimberly agreed. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no way your Mom can get all of your Daddy&rsquo;s big cock in her mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She really did it. All nine inches. All the way to his balls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine inches!?!&rdquo; Kimberly scoffed. &ldquo;That mother fucker looks like it&rsquo;s at least a foot long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I overheard Mom telling one of her friends that she measured it and that it was nine inches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told a friend about it.&rdquo; Kimberly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Robinson,&rdquo; Dennie explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been friends since they were like in the first grade. They talk about men and sex. Mrs. Robinson likes sex but hates men. Her husbands and boyfriends have all been assholes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really watched him fuck her and eat her pussy.&rdquo; Veronica whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ate her before and after fucking,&rdquo; Dennie giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He licked her cunt after he filled it with cum!?!&rdquo; Kimberly giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ewww!&rdquo; Veronica exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy likes it. He calls it eating cream pie. He says it&rsquo;s his favorite dessert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made my presence known. &ldquo;I forgot my wallet,&rdquo; I said as I walked past Dennie&rsquo;s open door. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to interrupt the conversation.&rdquo; I stuffed the wallet in my back pocket and went back down stairs. I was on the front porch when Dennie caught up with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did you hear?&rdquo; She asked, blushing brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything after Kimberly said that there was no fucking way that Fran can get all of my big hard cock in her mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that I should be, but I&rsquo;m not. Don&rsquo;t tell them, but listening to y&rsquo;all was a bit of a turn-on for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You liked it!&rdquo; she giggled, looking pointedly at my burgeoning bulge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Anyway, they now know they don&rsquo;t have to watch their language around me. They can talk like they would when no adults are around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not mad at me for watching?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has to be a secret between you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved you watching. It&rsquo;s a turn-on,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I walked two block to the nearest convenience store, wishing that I had bugged Dennie&rsquo;s room. I got a gallon of Rocky Road and a jar of strawberry topping. I wrapped the carton in plastic and two paper bags to hold in the cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m home,&rdquo; I yelled as I opened the front door.</p>
<p>Dennie charged down the stairs. Her friends balked at the top, blushing.</p>
<p>I proceeded to the kitchen, where I opened the ice cream and got four bowls from the cabinet.</p>
<p>Kimberly and Veronica entered the kitchen reluctantly, with Dennie pushing them from behind. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>I scooped the ice cream into the bowls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you ladies put the topping on yourselves.&rdquo; I paused. &ldquo;That would be kinky. I mean I&rsquo;ll let you put the topping on the ice cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief moment of confusion before Veronica caught on, and had a giggle fit. Dennie and Kimberly quickly caught on.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put the topping on ourselves,&rdquo; Dennie giggled.</p>
<p>I excused myself, went to the bathroom and jacked off. I ejaculated profusely after about half a dozen strokes. Afterward, I carried my bowl up to my office and began writing this report. As I wrote, my cock tumesced until the head was boldly protruding from my cutoffs&rsquo; left leg.</p>
<p>Dennie came up stairs as I was pulling a sheet from my typewriter and laying it aside, upside down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatcha writin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;a short story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sexy short story?&rdquo; She asked, looking at my cockhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. A sexy short story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re writing porn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daddy&rsquo;s a part time pornographist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pornographist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds classier than pornographer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I read it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t even let your mother read my rough drafts. Maybe after I&rsquo;ve finished it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denise whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell them I told you, but Kim and Ronnie said that they&rsquo;d put the strawberry topping on themselves if you&rsquo;d lick it all off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My cock lurched at the thought. A drop of precum appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she asked, pointing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It called Cowper&rsquo;s fluid. Most people call it precum,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really slick, and lubricates the cock for fucking. Girls&rsquo; pussies also produce a lubricant. Your pussy gets juicy when you play with it. Doesn&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blushed and stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Everybody plays with themselves. It&rsquo;s natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&hellip;my pussy does get juicy when I play with it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet your pussy feels juicy right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blushed, giggled and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you and Kimberly and Veronica play with each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dennie looked shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honey, I&rsquo;ll tell you anything you want to know about sex or anything else. I want us to be able to talk to each other about anything. But it has to be our secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded shyly. &ldquo;Sometimes we play with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a kid, me and my best friend fooled around some. We played with each other&rsquo;s cock. We didn&rsquo;t start until we were 12 or 13. Boys mature sexually later than girls.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t tell her that Charley and I had only jacked each other off only one time. It was the 1950&rsquo;s - the post war Victorian Era. We never mentioned it again. I wanted to do it some more, and he probably did too, but homosexually was taboo. No one talked about it, other than slurs, like faggot and cocksucker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys are jerks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls came up the stairs. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything about licking strawberry topping off their bodies,&rdquo; she whispered before walking out of the office and leading them into her bedroom.</p>
<p>I went into my bedroom, undressed and masturbated again, visualizing naked undeveloped bodies covered with strawberry topping, inviting me to lick it all off. I donned my smoking jacket and returned to the office to resume writing the report.</p>
<p>I got so involved in the writing that I was unaware of the time, and was surprised when the girls suddenly appeared in the office, wearing their nighties. Dennie wore her usual too small tee shirt and panties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you gonna order the pizza, Daddy.&rdquo;</p>
