  "articleBody": "Next Saturday Robyn was going out on a date with her boyfriend Billy. She spent hours getting dolled up in just the right clothes. She was especially proud of her new thong and bra that closed in the front. She showed me how it worked several times, flashing her cute tits at me. She also showed me how she had trimmed her bush so it wouldn‚Äôt stick out around her tiny thong. I was hard as a rock as she finished getting dressed. She seemed to enjoy tormenting me, but no hand job this time. Her boyfriend honked out front. She grabbed my cock and squeezed for one last torment then she skipped out of my reach and ran out to her boyfriend‚Äôs rumbling hot rod.\nI was pissed. I dropped my pants, grabbed the lotion off her dresser and started jacking off right there. I came almost immediately all over her dresser, the mirror behind it and an open drawer full of her underwear. Ha, serves her right.\nI grabbed some of her silky underwear out of the drawer and used them to clean my dripping cock. It felt wonderful, even better than the lotion.\nGrabbing a handful of underwear, I fall onto her bed. I jack my meat with handfuls of her silk cumming again and again until I can‚Äôt stand it anymore. Finally, I roll over and half-heartedly hump her bed. Her pillow smells like her and I bury my nose in it as I drift off to sleep, surrounded with cum soaked sheets and clothes.\n‚ÄúYOU LITTLE SHIT!!‚Äù Robyn screams at me as she falls on me. She beats on me, calling me every name in the book. I try to curl up and protect myself as she slaps me, scratches at me and screams and screams. I try to shove her off me and get away. This just pisses her off and starts punching me ‚ÄúBastard, Bastard, BASTARD.‚Äù She slips a left in and bloodies my nose. I bleed like a stuck pig and now there is both blood and cum all over her bed. I try to grab her arms just to defend myself. I finally throw her off and try to get up. She grabs me and bursts into tears. ‚ÄúOh, God, I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù She clings to me weeping.\nI grab one of the least cum soaked panties and try to stop the bleeding. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Robyn. I guess I got carried away, sorry.‚Äù\nShe sniffs. ‚ÄúYou are a little shit.‚Äù She looks around surveying the damage. ‚ÄúGod, what a mess. Why are you boys such idiots?‚Äù\nMy nose is just dripping now. I shrug. I notice that it‚Äôs only 9 o‚Äôclock. Robyn never gets home from her dates before midnight. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I mumble. I dab my nose, which hurts like hell, but it seems to have stopped bleeding. I try to change the subject, ‚ÄúWhy are you home?‚Äù\n‚ÄúThat shit Billy. We went to see that stupid new Bond movie. He was all super horny and made me blow him in the back row. Then he wouldn‚Äôt even touch me. I swear he fell asleep with his dick hanging out. I got so frustrated, I just up and left. And then, when I finally get home, I find This Shit!‚Äù she says waving at the mess.\n‚ÄúSo you hit him?‚Äù I ask.\n‚ÄúWhat? No, I should have though, right in his balls. Or maybe bit them when he made me suck them. Ha!‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou sucked his balls?!‚Äù\n‚ÄúYeah, he loves it, but I usually make him go down on me first.‚Äù I must have looked confused and disgusted. ‚ÄúWhat? You don‚Äôt know about blow jobs?‚Äù\nI shrug.\n‚ÄúGod, Edward. You are so naÔøΩve.‚Äù\n‚ÄúSorry to disappoint you, dear sister.‚Äù I get up to leave, only noticing then that I have another raging hard on.\nRobyn sees it too and looks at me with a hungry look I‚Äôd never seen before. Without warning, she drops to her knees and kisses the head of my cock tenderly. After kissing my prick, she kisses down the underside, and then licks it up back up to the head. She sucks and swallows my cock deep into her mouth until her nose pushed into the hair at the base of my cock. The pleasure was making me delirious but at the same time, I felt a little embarrassed for my sister. Between all my friends, the name ‚Äúcocksucker‚Äù was the worst thing we called each other.\nI stopped worrying about calling my sister names and began to REALLY enjoy what was happening. The now familiar pleasure she taught me about last week was building. I couldn‚Äôt relax and yet it seemed like any minute now, the dam would burst. Jacking off was great, but it was nothing like all the wonderful feelings Robyn was giving me.\nSuddenly, I came, hard. She pulled back, surprised and I got a big gob in her hair and down one side of her face before she got my dick back in her mouth. After that, she sucked it like it was a straw leading to her favorite soda. When my gushes subsided to an occasional dribble, Sis slid my cock out and kissed the end, letting me see my cum ooze out with each throb. She didn‚Äôt try to lick all the stuff off, preferring to let it drip down her chin and onto her breasts, rubbing it in there.\n‚ÄúOkay, now it‚Äôs your turn to do me,‚Äù Robyn exclaimed. Lying back on her bed, she pulled off her shirt and bra and kicked off her skirt. Her cute little thong she was wearing when she left was long gone. She brought her feet up beside her hips and spread her thighs wide. As she spread her legs, I could now see that there was a lot more to see than I had remembered from our ‚Äúback rub‚Äù years before. At the point where her pubic hair became thinner, a moist pink button stood. Beneath that was a darker pink area, roughly oval in shape that seemed almost to be moving.\n‚ÄúCome on, little brother, I want you to suck my pussy!‚Äù She began to run a finger over that little pink button, while she massaged her breasts with her other hand. I was curious enough. I knew that she was supposed to have a hole down there but I couldn‚Äôt see a hole, certainly not one big enough to put a finger into, much less a cock. But this was my chance to explore so I lay down on my stomach between her feet and began feeling this strange area.\nHer pubic hair, where she hadn‚Äôt shaved it, was soft but kinky, the curls being thick and tight. Still, it was a soothing feeling running my fingers through those curls. While doing that, I gently nudged the pink button, wondering what it was. I didn‚Äôt remember seeing anything like it the last time we had examined each other a few years back. Robyn asked me to kiss it for her.\nIt seemed kinda like a gross thing to do but after what she had done for me I figured that I wouldn‚Äôt look any sillier than she had. I kissed it and she moaned. I couldn‚Äôt smell anything with my sore nose, so decided to kiss it and lick it again. Robyn groaned even louder.\n‚ÄúDoes that feel good?‚Äù I asked stupidly.\n‚ÄúGod, yes,‚Äù she moaned. In all honesty, it wasn‚Äôt doing anything for me, but Robyn was fit to be tied. She began moaning and jerking like I had done earlier. She grabbed my head and held me to her as I licked and sucked and occasionally gasped for air. ‚ÄúYes, yes, yes,‚Äù she moaned and was moving so much I was having trouble keeping my mouth on her button. ‚ÄúYes, Yes, Yesss, YYYEEEESSSSS!‚Äù she cried as she went stiff, crushing my mouth to her ridged spasming body.\nShe collapsed, spent, letting go of my head. Not finished with my explorations yet, I pulled back and began moving my finger under the button. The oval patch glistened almost dripped with moisture and my finger slid easily down and around the area. Giving it slight pressure, it slid into the center and disappeared up to my knuckle. I could tell it was even wetter and warmer inside. I slid my finger deeper and deeper until it was all the way in. Robyn stirred and moaned ‚ÄúMore.‚Äù I slid my wet finger out and tried my thumb then two fingers, feeling this mysterious cave become tighter and tighter each try. With my two fingers deep inside of her, she moaned again. ‚ÄúTongue‚Ä¶use your tongue.‚Äù\nGod, I thought, next she‚Äôll want me to lick her ass. When I pulled my fingers out, I couldn‚Äôt smell them with my bloody nose but they didn‚Äôt taste bad. Funky maybe, but not gross. So I placed my open mouth on this strange area and proceeded to lick my way in. When I tried to pull back, she wrapped her thighs around my head preventing any escape. In fact, she almost prevented any breathing with my stopped up bloody nose. She came so hard she almost snapped my neck with her legs.\nSoon, she was lying back, panting for breath, ‚ÄúGod, you‚Äôre a natural, Edward, much better than Billy.‚Äù I just grinned sheepishly. ‚ÄúFor that,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúyou get a special reward. Do me again while I do you.‚Äù\nI was confused again. She just laughed and pulled me up to her. I thought she wanted to fuck, and at least I knew what that was. But she stopped me when I tried to slide my rock hard cock in her sloppy cunt. ‚ÄúSlow down there, little brother. Not that. Not yet.‚Äù\nShe slid out from under me and pushed me onto my back. Then she got up and for a moment, I thought she was going to climb up and ride my cock with her juicy cunt. Instead, she turned around and lowered her dripping cunt onto my face as she sucked my now aching cock deep into her mouth. Again, I just acted naturally. I couldn‚Äôt reach her cunt hole with my tongue, so I licked and sucked on her little pink button some more. She went wild, groaning around my cock as she sucked it deeper and deeper down her throat. It wasn‚Äôt long before I was getting close. I started humping her mouth, harder and faster until I groaned too, grabbed her head and came one last, gushing time. This drove my horny sister over the edge, too, clamping her legs hard around my head cumming and gushing all over my face.\nI gently lifted Robyn off me and she crawled around and gave me a big wet, sloppy, cummy kiss. It was kinda nasty tasting, but I didn‚Äôt care. I had come for who knows how many times that day and Robyn seemed sated too. As we both drifted off to sleep, our hot, sweaty bodies still tangled together, I think I heard Robyn mumble, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre even better than Dad‚Ä¶.‚Äù\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Next Saturday Robyn was going out on a date with her boyfriend Billy. She spent hours getting dolled up in just the right clothes. She was especially proud of her new thong and bra that closed in the front. She showed me how it worked several times, flashing her cute tits at me.

<p>Grabbing a handful of underwear, I fall onto her bed. I jack my meat with handfuls of her silk cumming again and again until I can&rsquo;t stand it anymore. Finally, I roll over and half-heartedly hump her bed. Her pillow smells like her and I bury my nose in it as I drift off to sleep, surrounded with cum soaked sheets and clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;YOU LITTLE SHIT!!&rdquo; Robyn screams at me as she falls on me. She beats on me, calling me every name in the book. I try to curl up and protect myself as she slaps me, scratches at me and screams and screams. I try to shove her off me and get away. This just pisses her off and starts punching me &ldquo;Bastard, Bastard, BASTARD.&rdquo; She slips a left in and bloodies my nose. I bleed like a stuck pig and now there is both blood and cum all over her bed. I try to grab her arms just to defend myself. I finally throw her off and try to get up. She grabs me and bursts into tears. &ldquo;Oh, God, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo; She clings to me weeping.</p>
<p>I grab one of the least cum soaked panties and try to stop the bleeding. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Robyn. I guess I got carried away, sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sniffs. &ldquo;You are a little shit.&rdquo; She looks around surveying the damage. &ldquo;God, what a mess. Why are you boys such idiots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My nose is just dripping now. I shrug. I notice that it&rsquo;s only 9 o&rsquo;clock. Robyn never gets home from her dates before midnight. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I mumble. I dab my nose, which hurts like hell, but it seems to have stopped bleeding. I try to change the subject, &ldquo;Why are you home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shit Billy. We went to see that stupid new Bond movie. He was all super horny and made me blow him in the back row. Then he wouldn&rsquo;t even touch me. I swear he fell asleep with his dick hanging out. I got so frustrated, I just up and left. And then, when I finally get home, I find This Shit!&rdquo; she says waving at the mess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you hit him?&rdquo; I ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? No, I should have though, right in his balls. Or maybe bit them when he made me suck them. Ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sucked his balls?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, he loves it, but I usually make him go down on me first.&rdquo; I must have looked confused and disgusted. &ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t know about blow jobs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, Edward. You are so naÔve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to disappoint you, dear sister.&rdquo; I get up to leave, only noticing then that I have another raging hard on.</p>
<p>Robyn sees it too and looks at me with a hungry look I&rsquo;d never seen before. Without warning, she drops to her knees and kisses the head of my cock tenderly.

<p>&ldquo;Okay, now it&rsquo;s your turn to do me,&rdquo; Robyn exclaimed. Lying back on her bed, she pulled off her shirt and bra and kicked off her skirt. Her cute little thong she was wearing when she left was long gone. She brought her feet up beside her hips and spread her thighs wide. As she spread her legs, I could now see that there was a lot more to see than I had remembered from our &ldquo;back rub&rdquo; years before. At the point where her pubic hair became thinner, a moist pink button stood. Beneath that was a darker pink area, roughly oval in shape that seemed almost to be moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, little brother, I want you to suck my pussy!&rdquo; She began to run a finger over that little pink button, while she massaged her breasts with her other hand. I was curious enough. I knew that she was supposed to have a hole down there but I couldn&rsquo;t see a hole, certainly not one big enough to put a finger into, much less a cock. But this was my chance to explore so I lay down on my stomach between her feet and began feeling this strange area.</p>
<p>Her pubic hair, where she hadn&rsquo;t shaved it, was soft but kinky, the curls being thick and tight. Still, it was a soothing feeling running my fingers through those curls. While doing that, I gently nudged the pink button, wondering what it was. I didn&rsquo;t remember seeing anything like it the last time we had examined each other a few years back. Robyn asked me to kiss it for her.</p>
<p>It seemed kinda like a gross thing to do but after what she had done for me I figured that I wouldn&rsquo;t look any sillier than she had. I kissed it and she moaned. I couldn&rsquo;t smell anything with my sore nose, so decided to kiss it and lick it again. Robyn groaned even louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that feel good?&rdquo; I asked stupidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, yes,&rdquo; she moaned. In all honesty, it wasn&rsquo;t doing anything for me, but Robyn was fit to be tied. She began moaning and jerking like I had done earlier. She grabbed my head and held me to her as I licked and sucked and occasionally gasped for air. &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; she moaned and was moving so much I was having trouble keeping my mouth on her button. &ldquo;Yes, Yes, Yesss, YYYEEEESSSSS!&rdquo; she cried as she went stiff, crushing my mouth to her ridged spasming body.</p>
<p>She collapsed, spent, letting go of my head. Not finished with my explorations yet, I pulled back and began moving my finger under the button. The oval patch glistened almost dripped with moisture and my finger slid easily down and around the area. Giving it slight pressure, it slid into the center and disappeared up to my knuckle. I could tell it was even wetter and warmer inside. I slid my finger deeper and deeper until it was all the way in. Robyn stirred and moaned &ldquo;More.&rdquo; I slid my wet finger out and tried my thumb then two fingers, feeling this mysterious cave become tighter and tighter each try. With my two fingers deep inside of her, she moaned again. &ldquo;Tongue&hellip;use your tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God, I thought, next she&rsquo;ll want me to lick her ass. When I pulled my fingers out, I couldn&rsquo;t smell them with my bloody nose but they didn&rsquo;t taste bad. Funky maybe, but not gross. So I placed my open mouth on this strange area and proceeded to lick my way in. When I tried to pull back, she wrapped her thighs around my head preventing any escape. In fact, she almost prevented any breathing with my stopped up bloody nose. She came so hard she almost snapped my neck with her legs.</p>
<p>Soon, she was lying back, panting for breath, &ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re a natural, Edward, much better than Billy.&rdquo; I just grinned sheepishly. &ldquo;For that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you get a special reward. Do me again while I do you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was confused again. She just laughed and pulled me up to her. I thought she wanted to fuck, and at least I knew what that was. But she stopped me when I tried to slide my rock hard cock in her sloppy cunt. &ldquo;Slow down there, little brother. Not that. Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slid out from under me and pushed me onto my back. Then she got up and for a moment, I thought she was going to climb up and ride my cock with her juicy cunt. Instead, she turned around and lowered her dripping cunt onto my face as she sucked my now aching cock deep into her mouth. Again, I just acted naturally. I couldn&rsquo;t reach her cunt hole with my tongue, so I licked and sucked on her little pink button some more. She went wild, groaning around my cock as she sucked it deeper and deeper down her throat. It wasn&rsquo;t long before I was getting close. I started humping her mouth, harder and faster until I groaned too, grabbed her head and came one last, gushing time. This drove my horny sister over the edge, too, clamping her legs hard around my head cumming and gushing all over my face.</p>
<p>I gently lifted Robyn off me and she crawled around and gave me a big wet, sloppy, cummy kiss. It was kinda nasty tasting, but I didn&rsquo;t care. I had come for who knows how many times that day and Robyn seemed sated too. As we both drifted off to sleep, our hot, sweaty bodies still tangled together, I think I heard Robyn mumble, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re even better than Dad&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
