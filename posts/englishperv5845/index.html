  "articleBody": "For those who wish to read this series in order, here is a glossary of each episode with a short summary of what is in each. As I posted each one, I’ve been calling them ‘stories’ as part of the ‘Pedo Ring Series’. I guess, more accurately they should be called ’episodes’. I’ll stick to that from now on, but each one could be read as an individual story if you wish - a kind of snapshot of pedo life - although making a bit more sense in the full context. You could dip in and out in any random order if you wish, but might be fun to see it through from the beginning.\nAs the series title suggests, this is a series of glimpses into the life and work of a fictional pedo ring, with a loose storyline linking them all. I have attempted realism in describing sexual activity between adults and children, and tried to give each character some credible personal development throughout. It is dark at times, for the sake of believability, but also has many sweet angles to it, reflecting the variety of men involved. Some of the male characters originated as actual readers of the story, and I wrote them into the script. It’s not too late for new applicants! [email me with description of you, fictionalized as much as you like!].\nThe Episodes posted individually under the following titles\n#1 Pedo Sean’s 10 Favourite Things\nThe longest of the episodes at 5,400 words. Introduces Sean (35yo) and his stepdaughter Hannah (9yo), the two central characters of the series. It’s a snapshot of a typical week they have, in effect a descriptive anthology of the ways he most likes to sexually molest her.\n#2 Pedo Sean’s 11th Favourite Thing\nFurther description of Hannah, a very sexy but typical 9-year-old girl. An in-depth description of a what can probably best be described as a session of ‘serious’ sexual abuse at the hands of her stepdad, Sean.\n#3 Pedo Sean’s Tender and Loving Side\nSean is not entirely a bad pedo and, like many such men, he has a certain genuine affection for his ‘victim’. Here, we see how he shows this in a gentle type of session with the lovely child, but it is no less hardcore and we must remember she is only 9 years old.\n#4 Pedo Sean and Little Hannah’s Secret Life\nNo actual sex takes place in this episode, but it is important plot development. Sean has to go to the school to meet his 9yo stepdaughter’s teacher. In this situation there is always the danger his illegal lifestyle with the child may get discovered.\n#5 A Primary Teacher’s Pedo Dream\nHow many teachers resemble new character, Dan Hall, Hannah’s 32yo schoolteacher? He has secretly harboured a sexual attraction to many of his preteen students, especially those in his class of 9/10 year olds, and especially Hannah! Now, incredibly, he might be getting his wish!\n#6 Sharing 9-Year-Old Hannah\nA very popular episode, this, judging by the reviews. A detailed coverage of how a stepfather and a new pedo buddy (Dan, the girl’s teacher) share the sexual molestation of the child between them. Hannah now has two regular ‘abusers’, if you want to use that severe term.\n#7 Putting 9-Year-Old Hannah To Bed\nFollowing on from the activity above, the two men put the child to bed, but not in the normal sense of putting a child to bed - in this case, the 32-year-old Daniel gets into the bed with her for a while. What stuff does he do while in there?\n#8 Dan Returns For More of Little Hannah\nWhen a 32-year-old guy has had ‘sex’ (such as it is) with a pretty 9-year-old girl, it’s very possible he’ll be hooked. It’s one of those things - after doing it once, nothing else would seem quite as good. Also, is this actually ’love’ or just sick pedo lust?\n#9 Dan’s Idea For Little Hannah\nAnother evening in the sexual molestation of a beautiful 9-year-old girl rolls on. The two men, stepdad Sean and teacher Daniel indulge in real hardcore stuff with the child. It’s so wrong yet so right. This one was co-written with Penquin.\n#10 A Third Man For Little Hannah\nNo sexual action in this, but don’t let that put you off. There’s plenty of talk of it, and crude child-sex imagery. It’s short and addresses the frank and shocking details of the type of negotiations pedos might do when making a new ‘contact’.\n#11 9-Year-Old Hannah Worries About Meeting Man\nA short episode giving a snapshot of the child ‘victim’ point of view. A third man has been invited and his arrival is imminent. Issues of discipline and control of the child are touched upon. If there is resistance, how is it dealt with? In a word: easily.\n#12 Hannah, Your Third Man Is Here\nThe ‘outrageous situation’ - as one reviewer put it - of 3 men who have assembled to enjoy an evening of sexuality activity with a 9-year-old child. Nobody can be sure exactly what little Hannah would be thinking as she enters the bedroom where she is to spend 2 hours with the 65-year-old newcomer.\n#13 Little Hannah’s Summer of Molestation\nThe dynamics of a 3-man molestation of the 9-year-old child is continued throughout her summer holidays. They can enjoy some things to her more safely than when she was at school. We see how her relationship with each man varies, as does their feelings for her.\n#14 Fun and Games With Young Hannah\nThe 65yo Bill likes to bring roleplay into the sessions of sexual molestation of the 9yo child, and this is one such session. All 3 of her adult abusers are with her here. This is fun but kind of sad too, depending on your point of view.\n#15 Maybe A Worse Pedo For Little Hannah\nNo live sex in this one, but a detailed description of a very extreme child sex video that the two characters in the scene are watching. A buddy of Sean has entered the story, and looks like he may be an even tougher kind of pedo. Issues of ‘favourite age’ arise.\n#16 Planning For Sweet Innocent Abigail\nThe series takes a darker turn as Sean and Simon, the two main pedo characters, plot how to snatch the delightful 10yo girl. No action here, but enjoy a description of her looks, and the discussion of what they hope to do to her.\n#17 Abducting Nice 10yo Abigail\nDark episode detailing how the pretty child is taken, and they the two pedos terrorize her and begin the physical assault. Also, there is an update on the original preteen girl of the series, Hannah, as she is on holiday with her 32year-old molester.\n#18 The Rape of Abigail\nExactly as the title suggests. Quite simply the narrative of two-man severely sexually molesting a 10-year-old girl whom they have kidnapped for a few hours. Frank but sensible and realistic detail is attempted. The child has to be released alive and not seriously physically hurt.\n#19 A Tale of Two Little Girl’s Sex-Lives\nThe kidnap and ravaging of poor 10-year-old Abigail is completed, and the luckier 9-year-old Hannah has now returned from a holiday of sexual molestation with her 32yo schoolteacher. How will she be welcomed by stepfather Sean, and what is in store for her from the other pedos?\n#20 Little Slave Girl Hannah\nA group session where 3 of the regular pedos have got together to enjoy the 9-year-old Hannah. Their camaraderie is explored, but there is plenty of sex action here too. Also, there is a particularly immoral and rather sad video to show to the 65yo Bill, regarding his 10yo step-granddaughter, Abigail.\n#21 A Little Flower Called Camelia\nAn episode to interest those like ‘vey’ young little girls, like ‘6’. A new girl-child character is introduced to the series, and details of her early molestations are heard. Meanwhile, the preteen Hannah’s sex life continues from day to day at the hands of stepdad and 3 other pedophile guys. Even Mom may be complicit in it now too.\n#22 Little Girl Swap\nSystematic ‘dealing’ is now taking place, as a new pedo contact is given payback time for his loan of little Camelia the week before. In return he gets to meet Hannah, thus becoming the pretty 9-year-old’s 5th man to have hardcore sexual activity with. Issues of comparing 6yo to 9yo are raised - which is best? And why?\n#23 An Extremely Unripe and Exotic Delicacy\nThe title refers to… well, go and see. Keen pedos, Sean and Simon, are given 3 hours to commence the sexual abuse of a 6yo girl in earnest. This is an organised and sensible pedo ring, however, and sex with a 6yo has obvious limitations. How will they handle it? In the words of one reviewer: ‘Not too rough, just the right amount of outrageous sexual behaviour’.\n#24 A Very Small-Looking Whore\nNo sexual action here, just a snapshot of a scene where you can share the thoughts and reactions of a man who comes across much more than he bargained for when searching for a whore. His first impression, from a distance, why the hell does she look so small??\n#25 The Pricing of Young Hannah\nThe prostitute of the last episode was of course a child-prostitute, and no less than child-sex ring regular, the now 10yo Hannah. This episode is seen from her and stepdad Sean’s viewpoint, as she is pimped on the street for the first ever time. Customer number 1 represents, in the words of one reviewer, ’the common man, lets see where he goes with this pedo opportunity.’\n#26 A Little Whore to Remember\nA man gets his first ever child-sex experience. What does he get exactly for his money on this occasion, and how good was it? ‘Wow, so realistic’ says one reviewer. Well, I try! - but this sick, disturbing scenario is only fiction.\n#27 Young Hannah’s Team Night\nOne of the 10-year-old’s weekly sessions with a group of her adult male molesters, four in this case. 65-year-old Bill likes to use roleplay at these meetings, with Hannah of course as the ‘star’. Review: ‘Having Michelle, Hannah’s mum, there participating and watching her little girl having sex with all these men, in the open is just hot!’\n#28 Marrying A 6-Year-Old Princess\nFour men, one very little girl. 65-year-old Bill yet again uses roleplay as a way of enjoying sex with a child, in this case the extremely young Camelia. In history, sometimes children did have to marry grown men. Would such a marriage be consummated??\n#29 Another Group Night for 10yo Hannah\nAn episode of build up to the actual action, but interesting to see the interaction between the four men who are present and preparing for a long evening of fun of the type pedos like to enjoy with a pretty child. We meet Robert again (her customer when she was whored out), who has returned for a more ‘fuller’ experience with her.\n#30 Fun and Games in the Pedo Ring\nThe continued evening of 4 men sexually molesting the 10-year-old Hannah. Details of how this was organized, and how she was shared four ways. Yet another roleplay by Bill is involved. How is this affecting the child? Is there pleasure for her, and do they care?\n#31 Fucked Fiona at Fourteen\nThe story of how an attractive 14-year-old girl comes to find herself in the midst of a pedo ring, and details of her early stage relationship with 37-year-old hardened pedo, Simon. Is it a ‘sexual relationship’? - of course it fucking is!\n#32 For the Lust of a 14 And a 10\n35yo pedo and stepfather of 10yo Hannah, Sean is very used to enjoying sex with a girl of 10 years of age or less. Here, however, he has an opportunity to compare it with sleeping with a sexy 14-year-old. Which is better? Also, here he tries perhaps the ultimate act of obscenity with a girl of only 10.\n#33 Spit-Roast Night For 10yo Hannah\nJust when you’d think 10yo Hannah’s degradation could not get any worse, stepfather Sean and his buddy Simon put her through one of the hardest-core sex acts that many grown women would blanche at. They’re only doing what many pedos would love to do, by the sound of it: ‘Totally approve! Been waiting for this one!’ says one reviewer.\n#34 Man Number Eight for 10yo Hannah\nAs the title suggests, we meet a new sexual abuser for Hannah here, with details of what he gets to do on his first time with her. Also present are Sean and Simon, so it’s a fairly routine 3-man-on evening for the 10-year-old child in her life in the clutches of a pedo ring.\n#35 Dinner Date With A 10-Year-Old Girl\nOrdinary guy and part-time ring member, 41yo Robert, has won the privilege of a full evening dating the pretty Hannah, to be followed by checking in at a motel room for the night. He has her to himself, and this is the story of how he conducts the whole thing and how the child responds to him.\n#36 A 7-Year-Old Treasure\nThey decided a new little girl was needed. This reviewer summarizes the episode nicely: ‘The image of a cute little 7 year old girl being dressed up in a sexy outfit and wearing lipstick makes the setting very appealing to me when she gets molested and fucked by 2 men, especially up that sweet little bum.’\n#37 Pedo Christmas Wishes\nBy way of summarizing and getting to know the 8 men involved in the pedo ring, this episode has them describing their tastes and their ideal pedo Xmas wish. No action, but you might enjoy seeing how their opinions compare to your own. Vile sentiments expressed, but also really quite sweet ones.\n#38 New Year Pedo Games\nThe 5 girls of ages ranging from 6 to 14 who are in the clutches of the pedo ring are summarized here, together with little comments on what the men like about them. A special party game to celebrate the New Year is being played, involving 3 of the girls.\n#39 Pedo Ring Sex So Far on 2013\nThe 8 men in the ring review their child-sex so far this year, picking out their favourite incident. Much graphic fictional description of sex with children in this episode. Plans are afoot to bring a particularly nice 9-year-old blonde into the fold. Everyone approves.\n#40 First Sexual Experiences For 9yo Elise\nConventional wisdom has it that no 9yo girl should have to engage in sex of any kind, but in this episode there are at least 3 men who disagree. She’s extremely pretty, she’s a good girl, and she’s very shy and innocent. How will they treat her?\n#41 9yo Elise Learns About Penetrative Sex\nThe phrase ‘a pedo’s dream’ can be overused, but Elise is an everyday blonde little girl that undoubtedly fits this description. A reviewer summarizes this episode very well: ‘A balance of describing how Elise copes with being violated and also satisfying the girl lovers wanting the envious play by play details of sex with a beautiful nine year old.’\n#42 An Orgy Of Child Sex, Part 1\nAs the title suggests, a lot of pedo activity is going on in the house of the central character, Sean. ‘There’s something fun going on in every room of the flat. What a romp!’ The men unashamedly explore their preferences from girls aged 7 through to 14.\n#43 An Orgy Of Child Sex, Part 2\nThe continuation of the last story, taking place over the course of a weekend. ‘Wow, what a ‘sight’, the girls side by side bent over on the bed. -Totally Hot!’ The various styles of the men can be seen.\n#44 Nice Bit Of Asian Child-Sex\nWe learn what can happen if a guy gets ‘carried away’ fucking a little girl’s mouth. The aftermath has to be dealt with, as arch-pedo Simon does exactly that. This is contrasted with the deeply satisfying and uncomplicated experience of sex with a ‘capable’ 11-year-old Asian girl.\n#45 Wanted: Child-Sex\nEver wondered if a pedo ever chances across a little girl he abused many years ago, now an upper-teen? Also, a high-libido member of the pedo ring is at a loose end for the thing he craves most: who will he find, and what age, to satisfy him?\n#46 Mad Love For A 10-Year-Old Girl\n‘The return of Abigail was well worth waiting for!’ Quite a powerful episode, dealing with the scenario of a guy having a 10yo girl in his family whom he craves. What will he do if he gets a week of trust, alone with her? Also explored is the morality of child-abuse and what really makes the child a victim?\n#47 The Varied Pedo Destinies of 6 Young Girls\nAs the pedo ring begins to break up, the various underage girls in it will experience different fates in the clutches of the varied guys. Different levels of willingness are explored, and we meet an American family who seem to show pedophilia can be a way of life: ‘Who wouldn’t want to travel and have sex all the time!?’ A cross-over with Arachnophile’s ‘Mandy \u0026 Amy’ series.\n#48 American Beauty - The Preteen Kind\nGets its title because the new girl character here can be imagined as a 12-year-old version of the blonde teen in the movie, ‘American Beauty’. Here one splinter-group of the British pedo ring and their girls link up with an American family who practise incest and child-sex with alacrity. A cross-over with Arachnophile’s ‘Mandy \u0026 Amy’ series.\n#49 Expert Little Girls and Novice Little Girls\nThis episode was nearly called ‘A Fond Farewell’: a man and his long-term child-victim have a final session together. All good things must come to an end. Meanwhile, across the pond, things are just beginning for one nervous and heartbreakingly inexperienced little girl.\n#50 To Sex With Little Girls\nYour feedback welcome. Would be interesting to hear what your favorite episode.\n",

      The Pedo Ring Series Summary of Episodes
    </h1>
    <div class="post-description">
      &#39;Excellent stories, I&#39;ve loved every one of the series so far. The best part is the realism of them; I really don&#39;t like stories with little girls who LOVE being gang-raped and so on. Hannah would obviously rather not have to do the things she does, which comes across beautifully in your writing.&#39; - Review.

  <div class="post-content"><p><em>For those who wish to read this series in order, here is a glossary of each episode with a short summary of what is in each. As I posted each one, I&rsquo;ve been calling them &lsquo;stories&rsquo; as part of the &lsquo;Pedo Ring Series&rsquo;. I guess, more accurately they should be called &rsquo;episodes&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll stick to that from now on, but each one could be read as an individual story if you wish - a kind of snapshot of pedo life - although making a bit more sense in the full context. You could dip in and out in any random order if you wish, but might be fun to see it through from the beginning.</em></p>
<p>As the series title suggests, this is a series of glimpses into the life and work of a fictional pedo ring, with a loose storyline linking them all. I have attempted realism in describing sexual activity between adults and children, and tried to give each character some credible personal development throughout. It is dark at times, for the sake of believability, but also has many sweet angles to it, reflecting the variety of men involved. Some of the male characters originated as actual readers of the story, and I wrote them into the script. It&rsquo;s not too late for new applicants! [email me with description of you, fictionalized as much as you like!].</p>
<h5 id="the-episodes">The Episodes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-episodes">#</a></h5>
<p><em>posted individually under the following titles</em></p>
<p><strong>#1 Pedo Sean&rsquo;s 10 Favourite Things</strong></p>
<p>The longest of the episodes at 5,400 words. Introduces Sean (35yo) and his stepdaughter Hannah (9yo), the two central characters of the series. It&rsquo;s a snapshot of a typical week they have, in effect a descriptive anthology of the ways he most likes to sexually molest her.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Pedo Sean&rsquo;s 11th Favourite Thing</strong></p>
<p>Further description of Hannah, a very sexy but typical 9-year-old girl. An in-depth description of a what can probably best be described as a session of &lsquo;serious&rsquo; sexual abuse at the hands of her stepdad, Sean.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Pedo Sean&rsquo;s Tender and Loving Side</strong></p>
<p>Sean is not entirely a bad pedo and, like many such men, he has a certain genuine affection for his &lsquo;victim&rsquo;. Here, we see how he shows this in a gentle type of session with the lovely child, but it is no less hardcore and we must remember she is only 9 years old.</p>
<p><strong>#4 Pedo Sean and Little Hannah&rsquo;s Secret Life</strong></p>
<p>No actual sex takes place in this episode, but it is important plot development. Sean has to go to the school to meet his 9yo stepdaughter&rsquo;s teacher. In this situation there is always the danger his illegal lifestyle with the child may get discovered.</p>
<p><strong>#5 A Primary Teacher&rsquo;s Pedo Dream</strong></p>
<p>How many teachers resemble new character, Dan Hall, Hannah&rsquo;s 32yo schoolteacher? He has secretly harboured a sexual attraction to many of his preteen students, especially those in his class of 9/10 year olds, and especially Hannah! Now, incredibly, he might be getting his wish!</p>
<p><strong>#6 Sharing 9-Year-Old Hannah</strong></p>
<p>A very popular episode, this, judging by the reviews. A detailed coverage of how a stepfather and a new pedo buddy (Dan, the girl&rsquo;s teacher) share the sexual molestation of the child between them. Hannah now has two regular &lsquo;abusers&rsquo;, if you want to use that severe term.</p>
<p><strong>#7 Putting 9-Year-Old Hannah To Bed</strong></p>
<p>Following on from the activity above, the two men put the child to bed, but not in the normal sense of putting a child to bed - in this case, the 32-year-old Daniel gets into the bed with her for a while. What stuff does he do while in there?</p>
<p><strong>#8 Dan Returns For More of Little Hannah</strong></p>
<p>When a 32-year-old guy has had &lsquo;sex&rsquo; (such as it is) with a pretty 9-year-old girl, it&rsquo;s very possible he&rsquo;ll be hooked. It&rsquo;s one of those things - after doing it once, nothing else would seem quite as good. Also, is this actually &rsquo;love&rsquo; or just sick pedo lust?</p>
<p><strong>#9 Dan&rsquo;s Idea For Little Hannah</strong></p>
<p>Another evening in the sexual molestation of a beautiful 9-year-old girl rolls on. The two men, stepdad Sean and teacher Daniel indulge in real hardcore stuff with the child. It&rsquo;s so wrong yet so right. This one was co-written with Penquin.</p>
<p><strong>#10 A Third Man For Little Hannah</strong></p>
<p>No sexual action in this, but don&rsquo;t let that put you off. There&rsquo;s plenty of talk of it, and crude child-sex imagery. It&rsquo;s short and addresses the frank and shocking details of the type of negotiations pedos might do when making a new &lsquo;contact&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>#11 9-Year-Old Hannah Worries About Meeting Man</strong></p>
<p>A short episode giving a snapshot of the child &lsquo;victim&rsquo; point of view. A third man has been invited and his arrival is imminent. Issues of discipline and control of the child are touched upon. If there is resistance, how is it dealt with? In a word: easily.</p>
<p><strong>#12 Hannah, Your Third Man Is Here</strong></p>
<p>The &lsquo;outrageous situation&rsquo; - as one reviewer put it - of 3 men who have assembled to enjoy an evening of sexuality activity with a 9-year-old child. Nobody can be sure exactly what little Hannah would be thinking as she enters the bedroom where she is to spend 2 hours with the 65-year-old newcomer.</p>
<p><strong>#13 Little Hannah&rsquo;s Summer of Molestation</strong></p>
<p>The dynamics of a 3-man molestation of the 9-year-old child is continued throughout her summer holidays. They can enjoy some things to her more safely than when she was at school. We see how her relationship with each man varies, as does their feelings for her.</p>
<p><strong>#14 Fun and Games With Young Hannah</strong></p>
<p>The 65yo Bill likes to bring roleplay into the sessions of sexual molestation of the 9yo child, and this is one such session. All 3 of her adult abusers are with her here. This is fun but kind of sad too, depending on your point of view.</p>
<p><strong>#15 Maybe A Worse Pedo For Little Hannah</strong></p>
<p>No live sex in this one, but a detailed description of a very extreme child sex video that the two characters in the scene are watching. A buddy of Sean has entered the story, and looks like he may be an even tougher kind of pedo. Issues of &lsquo;favourite age&rsquo; arise.</p>
<p><strong>#16 Planning For Sweet Innocent Abigail</strong></p>
<p>The series takes a darker turn as Sean and Simon, the two main pedo characters, plot how to snatch the delightful 10yo girl. No action here, but enjoy a description of her looks, and the discussion of what they hope to do to her.</p>
<p><strong>#17 Abducting Nice 10yo Abigail</strong></p>
<p>Dark episode detailing how the pretty child is taken, and they the two pedos terrorize her and begin the physical assault. Also, there is an update on the original preteen girl of the series, Hannah, as she is on holiday with her 32year-old molester.</p>
<p><strong>#18 The Rape of Abigail</strong></p>
<p>Exactly as the title suggests. Quite simply the narrative of two-man severely sexually molesting a 10-year-old girl whom they have kidnapped for a few hours. Frank but sensible and realistic detail is attempted. The child has to be released alive and not seriously physically hurt.</p>
<p><strong>#19 A Tale of Two Little Girl&rsquo;s Sex-Lives</strong></p>
<p>The kidnap and ravaging of poor 10-year-old Abigail is completed, and the luckier 9-year-old Hannah has now returned from a holiday of sexual molestation with her 32yo schoolteacher. How will she be welcomed by stepfather Sean, and what is in store for her from the other pedos?</p>
<p><strong>#20 Little Slave Girl Hannah</strong></p>
<p>A group session where 3 of the regular pedos have got together to enjoy the 9-year-old Hannah. Their camaraderie is explored, but there is plenty of sex action here too. Also, there is a particularly immoral and rather sad video to show to the 65yo Bill, regarding his 10yo step-granddaughter, Abigail.</p>
<p><strong>#21 A Little Flower Called Camelia</strong></p>
<p>An episode to interest those like &lsquo;vey&rsquo; young little girls, like &lsquo;6&rsquo;. A new girl-child character is introduced to the series, and details of her early molestations are heard. Meanwhile, the preteen Hannah&rsquo;s sex life continues from day to day at the hands of stepdad and 3 other pedophile guys. Even Mom may be complicit in it now too.</p>
<p><strong>#22 Little Girl Swap</strong></p>
<p>Systematic &lsquo;dealing&rsquo; is now taking place, as a new pedo contact is given payback time for his loan of little Camelia the week before. In return he gets to meet Hannah, thus becoming the pretty 9-year-old&rsquo;s 5th man to have hardcore sexual activity with. Issues of comparing 6yo to 9yo are raised - which is best? And why?</p>
<p><strong>#23 An Extremely Unripe and Exotic Delicacy</strong></p>
<p>The title refers to&hellip; well, go and see. Keen pedos, Sean and Simon, are given 3 hours to commence the sexual abuse of a 6yo girl in earnest. This is an organised and sensible pedo ring, however, and sex with a 6yo has obvious limitations. How will they handle it? In the words of one reviewer: &lsquo;Not too rough, just the right amount of outrageous sexual behaviour&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>#24 A Very Small-Looking Whore</strong></p>
<p>No sexual action here, just a snapshot of a scene where you can share the thoughts and reactions of a man who comes across much more than he bargained for when searching for a whore. His first impression, from a distance, why the hell does she look so small??</p>
<p><strong>#25 The Pricing of Young Hannah</strong></p>
<p>The prostitute of the last episode was of course a child-prostitute, and no less than child-sex ring regular, the now 10yo Hannah. This episode is seen from her and stepdad Sean&rsquo;s viewpoint, as she is pimped on the street for the first ever time. Customer number 1 represents, in the words of one reviewer, &rsquo;the common man, lets see where he goes with this pedo opportunity.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>#26 A Little Whore to Remember</strong></p>
<p>A man gets his first ever child-sex experience. What does he get exactly for his money on this occasion, and how good was it? &lsquo;Wow, so realistic&rsquo; says one reviewer. Well, I try! - but this sick, disturbing scenario is only fiction.</p>
<p><strong>#27 Young Hannah&rsquo;s Team Night</strong></p>
<p>One of the 10-year-old&rsquo;s weekly sessions with a group of her adult male molesters, four in this case. 65-year-old Bill likes to use roleplay at these meetings, with Hannah of course as the &lsquo;star&rsquo;. Review: &lsquo;Having Michelle, Hannah&rsquo;s mum, there participating and watching her little girl having sex with all these men, in the open is just hot!&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>#28 Marrying A 6-Year-Old Princess</strong></p>
<p>Four men, one very little girl. 65-year-old Bill yet again uses roleplay as a way of enjoying sex with a child, in this case the extremely young Camelia. In history, sometimes children did have to marry grown men. Would such a marriage be consummated??</p>
<p><strong>#29 Another Group Night for 10yo Hannah</strong></p>
<p>An episode of build up to the actual action, but interesting to see the interaction between the four men who are present and preparing for a long evening of fun of the type pedos like to enjoy with a pretty child. We meet Robert again (her customer when she was whored out), who has returned for a more &lsquo;fuller&rsquo; experience with her.</p>
<p><strong>#30 Fun and Games in the Pedo Ring</strong></p>
<p>The continued evening of 4 men sexually molesting the 10-year-old Hannah. Details of how this was organized, and how she was shared four ways. Yet another roleplay by Bill is involved. How is this affecting the child? Is there pleasure for her, and do they care?</p>
<p><strong>#31 Fucked Fiona at Fourteen</strong></p>
<p>The story of how an attractive 14-year-old girl comes to find herself in the midst of a pedo ring, and details of her early stage relationship with 37-year-old hardened pedo, Simon. Is it a &lsquo;sexual relationship&rsquo;? - of course it fucking is!</p>
<p><strong>#32 For the Lust of a 14 And a 10</strong></p>
<p>35yo pedo and stepfather of 10yo Hannah, Sean is very used to enjoying sex with a girl of 10 years of age or less. Here, however, he has an opportunity to compare it with sleeping with a sexy 14-year-old. Which is better? Also, here he tries perhaps the ultimate act of obscenity with a girl of only 10.</p>
<p><strong>#33 Spit-Roast Night For 10yo Hannah</strong></p>
<p>Just when you&rsquo;d think 10yo Hannah&rsquo;s degradation could not get any worse, stepfather Sean and his buddy Simon put her through one of the hardest-core sex acts that many grown women would blanche at. They&rsquo;re only doing what many pedos would love to do, by the sound of it: &lsquo;Totally approve! Been waiting for this one!&rsquo; says one reviewer.</p>
<p><strong>#34 Man Number Eight for 10yo Hannah</strong></p>
<p>As the title suggests, we meet a new sexual abuser for Hannah here, with details of what he gets to do on his first time with her. Also present are Sean and Simon, so it&rsquo;s a fairly routine 3-man-on evening for the 10-year-old child in her life in the clutches of a pedo ring.</p>
<p><strong>#35 Dinner Date With A 10-Year-Old Girl</strong></p>
<p>Ordinary guy and part-time ring member, 41yo Robert, has won the privilege of a full evening dating the pretty Hannah, to be followed by checking in at a motel room for the night. He has her to himself, and this is the story of how he conducts the whole thing and how the child responds to him.</p>
<p><strong>#36 A 7-Year-Old Treasure</strong></p>
<p>They decided a new little girl was needed. This reviewer summarizes the episode nicely: &lsquo;The image of a cute little 7 year old girl being dressed up in a sexy outfit and wearing lipstick makes the setting very appealing to me when she gets molested and fucked by 2 men, especially up that sweet little bum.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>#37 Pedo Christmas Wishes</strong></p>
<p>By way of summarizing and getting to know the 8 men involved in the pedo ring, this episode has them describing their tastes and their ideal pedo Xmas wish. No action, but you might enjoy seeing how their opinions compare to your own. Vile sentiments expressed, but also really quite sweet ones.</p>
<p><strong>#38 New Year Pedo Games</strong></p>
<p>The 5 girls of ages ranging from 6 to 14 who are in the clutches of the pedo ring are summarized here, together with little comments on what the men like about them. A special party game to celebrate the New Year is being played, involving 3 of the girls.</p>
<p><strong>#39 Pedo Ring Sex So Far on 2013</strong></p>
<p>The 8 men in the ring review their child-sex so far this year, picking out their favourite incident. Much graphic fictional description of sex with children in this episode. Plans are afoot to bring a particularly nice 9-year-old blonde into the fold. Everyone approves.</p>
<p><strong>#40 First Sexual Experiences For 9yo Elise</strong></p>
<p>Conventional wisdom has it that no 9yo girl should have to engage in sex of any kind, but in this episode there are at least 3 men who disagree. She&rsquo;s extremely pretty, she&rsquo;s a good girl, and she&rsquo;s very shy and innocent. How will they treat her?</p>
<p><strong>#41 9yo Elise Learns About Penetrative Sex</strong></p>
<p>The phrase &lsquo;a pedo&rsquo;s dream&rsquo; can be overused, but Elise is an everyday blonde little girl that undoubtedly fits this description. A reviewer summarizes this episode very well: &lsquo;A balance of describing how Elise copes with being violated and also satisfying the girl lovers wanting the envious play by play details of sex with a beautiful nine year old.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>#42 An Orgy Of Child Sex, Part 1</strong></p>
<p>As the title suggests, a lot of pedo activity is going on in the house of the central character, Sean. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something fun going on in every room of the flat. What a romp!&rsquo; The men unashamedly explore their preferences from girls aged 7 through to 14.</p>
<p><strong>#43 An Orgy Of Child Sex, Part 2</strong></p>
<p>The continuation of the last story, taking place over the course of a weekend. &lsquo;Wow, what a &lsquo;sight&rsquo;, the girls side by side bent over on the bed. -Totally Hot!&rsquo; The various styles of the men can be seen.</p>
<p><strong>#44 Nice Bit Of Asian Child-Sex</strong></p>
<p>We learn what can happen if a guy gets &lsquo;carried away&rsquo; fucking a little girl&rsquo;s mouth. The aftermath has to be dealt with, as arch-pedo Simon does exactly that. This is contrasted with the deeply satisfying and uncomplicated experience of sex with a &lsquo;capable&rsquo; 11-year-old Asian girl.</p>
<p><strong>#45 Wanted: Child-Sex</strong></p>
<p>Ever wondered if a pedo ever chances across a little girl he abused many years ago, now an upper-teen? Also, a high-libido member of the pedo ring is at a loose end for the thing he craves most: who will he find, and what age, to satisfy him?</p>
<p><strong>#46 Mad Love For A 10-Year-Old Girl</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;The return of Abigail was well worth waiting for!&rsquo; Quite a powerful episode, dealing with the scenario of a guy having a 10yo girl in his family whom he craves. What will he do if he gets a week of trust, alone with her? Also explored is the morality of child-abuse and what really makes the child a victim?</p>
<p><strong>#47 The Varied Pedo Destinies of 6 Young Girls</strong></p>
<p>As the pedo ring begins to break up, the various underage girls in it will experience different fates in the clutches of the varied guys. Different levels of willingness are explored, and we meet an American family who seem to show pedophilia can be a way of life: &lsquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to travel and have sex all the time!?&rsquo; A cross-over with Arachnophile&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mandy &amp; Amy&rsquo; series.</p>
<p><strong>#48 American Beauty - The Preteen Kind</strong></p>
<p>Gets its title because the new girl character here can be imagined as a 12-year-old version of the blonde teen in the movie, &lsquo;American Beauty&rsquo;. Here one splinter-group of the British pedo ring and their girls link up with an American family who practise incest and child-sex with alacrity. A cross-over with Arachnophile&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mandy &amp; Amy&rsquo; series.</p>
<p><strong>#49 Expert Little Girls and Novice Little Girls</strong></p>
<p>This episode was nearly called &lsquo;A Fond Farewell&rsquo;: a man and his long-term child-victim have a final session together. All good things must come to an end. Meanwhile, across the pond, things are just beginning for one nervous and heartbreakingly inexperienced little girl.</p>
<p><strong>#50 To Sex With Little Girls</strong></p>

<p><strong>Your feedback welcome. Would be interesting to hear what your favorite episode.</strong></p>
