  "articleBody": "After Bill’s first visit and ‘acquaintance’ with Hannah, a rythmn was established. A rythmn with 3 players. A rythmn of visits and sexual sessions with the excellent little child. These were choreographed by Sean at the domestic hub of things, but with the bespectacled and mild-mannered Dan in an increasingly influential ‘advisory’ role. Sean, being in the same house as Hannah, tended to do quickies most days at any time of day, with more focused sessions - anal or vaginal penetrations - in the evenings when Michelle, the mother worked. Dan was around 2 or 3 days a week, with Bill visiting once a week, bringing with him some well-planned out idea. Furthermore, it was now July and the long school holidays had begun. This made things far safer, being able to be in total control of the child, but in a friendly way with the help of the professional Dan. Things like bite and suck marks could be inflicted: Hannah had soon collected various of these on her little neck, on her chest, on her tender buttocks and inner thighs. At one stage her outer labia was like one big pink love-bite: by Dan, who tended to suck at it like a plum sometimes for half an hour non-stop. Occasionally Hannah was given a complete 2 or 3 day break from it, if it seemed her delicate vaginal tissue or asshole was a little inflamed. Both were more durable in a 9yo than the average member of the public would think, though: their musculature and lining stretchable and trainable, with no real harm being done as long as big thrusts of the erection were avoided.\nIt was August 15th, and one such 3-day recess had just finished, on account of suspected mild cervical bruising. Hannah had complained of dull aching, low down in her tummy. Bill, it was thought, was responsible for that in one of his private bedroom sessions with her: he tended to need injection to get himself up, and when he successfully penetrated Hannah’s vagina - usually his act of choice - it was a very satisfying experience for him.\n“I’d like to take her away for a week,” said Dan.\n“Pardon?” said Sean, only half-amused.\n“Give her a little holiday, just her and me.”\nSean chuckled. “Um, where?”\n“Well, I’ll give her some say in that. Probably a guest house near a beach resort, or an isolated part of the countryside.”\n“I’d prefer the latter,” said Sean, firmly.\n“So, you’re in favour then, in principle?”\n“In principle, yes.”\n“Since Bill is coming tonight, it would be good timing. No doubt he’ll want to fuck her…”\n“No doubt.”\n“And it’s her least favourite session. So, good time to take a break afterward. And when we come back, in a week, Bill will not even feel as though he’s missed out.”\n“No,” said Sean. “Her least favourite session is when I make her sit on my prick, but I take your point.”\n“Speaking of which,” said Dan. “Mind putting on a show of that for us, when Bill gets here?”\n“Sure. That alright with you, Hannah?” Sean turned to her, as she watched TV just metres away from the whole discussion.\nHannah nodded, that delicious and enigmatic sadness in her blue eyes. She seemed more concerned with the TV, however, than the prospect of another difficult penetration of Sean’s erection up her rectum. “I’d like to go on holiday with Dan,” she said, politely.\n“Sure, princess. You can do that. Just do a good bum-ride for me later, and do your best having sex with Bill when he gets here, okay?”\n“Uh huh.”\n“I’ll make sure he is careful with you, sweetie,” said Dan.\n“Huh?” guffawed Sean. “I’m always careful!”\n“I mean Bill.”\n“Haha, oh yeah.”\n“Thank you,” said Hannah.\n“Don’t mention it, sweetie,” said Dan, coming over to her.\nHe gave her a kiss on the forehead, a ruffle of the hair and quick tickle up the front of her T-shirt. Hannah giggled and squirmed. Dan, a contented smile on his face, went upstairs to shower from the rather energetic bum-grind he’d performed on her 20 minutes ago. For Hannah, it just seemed like one of the fact of life that men - at least the 3 most influential ones she knew - were obsessed with her bottom, even more if anything than her pussy. By the time Dan came down from his shower, Hannah’s mother, Michelle, had come through the door after an afternoon shopping.\n“Yes,” she said, keenly. “Why don’t ya? She’ll really like that, won’t ya, Hannah?” As it had turned out, Michelle was completely agreeable to having Mr Dan Hall, teacher, around a lot and ‘close’ with her daughter. It gave Michelle, the useless chav, a feeling of ‘status’.\n“Yes, I’d like it,” said Hannah, mildy.\n“Will give me ‘an Sean some us-time together.” Sean suppressed a sigh, but was already thinking he might alleviate such boredom by probing just how far Michelle might ‘go with’ his interest in child-sex. It went without saying she already knew Sean was ‘at it’ with Hannah, and took it as ‘one of those things’. She probably suspected Dan was too, but she got a buzz from thinking of her daughter as the ultimate teacher’s pet. Perhaps because she herself had had a very unloved childhood, even in any sexual sense.\n“It will,” said Sean. “And will give Hannah a break from it all.”\nHe smiled crisply at his step-child. Michelle smiled too, but probably not realising the full meaning of break from it ‘all’. They had thought better of telling her about Bill. That could wait. He could easily be explained away as a drinking buddy of Sean or Dan, even some kind of educational support worker from the school - although such lies could cause complications - but basically Sean could not be bothered with introducing him yet. Hell, he only came once a week - in more ways than one, maybe - so it was simplest to keep him out of the picture. If he and Michelle crossed paths then it was a little bridge to be crossed when it happened.\n“Awww, yeah,” said Michelle, affectionately. Dan frowned in curiosity at her, wondering just how much she knew.\n“So, you gonna win loads at bingo tonight, my darling?” asked Sean.\n“Ahh, might not go.”\nDan pricked his ears up at that. Sean did not seem too rattled. He understood Michelle well enough to realise she merely didn’t want to feel ‘pushed out’ of the company of the refined Dan, and her rugged boyfriend. She was too dumb to twig that she was wanted out of the way for the arrival of a third man to have an evening of group fun with her 9-year-old daughter. Hannah, however, was listening to this part of the convo with interest: smart enough to understand she might be ’let off the hook’ for tonight, if her mother stayed around.\n“Go, hell, go woman,” said Sean, good-natured. “You know you love it. Don’t worry, we’ll do the babysitting. Besides, I think Dan has some work to go through with her, and they want some peace and quiet. I might get on with some DIY, myself.. It’s good for Hannah to stay with Dan. It helps her grow up into a right eloquent little princess.”\nDan nodded affirmation at Michelle. “Uh hum.”\n“Awww, yeah,” said Michelle. “She does really love her favourite teacher.”\n“I’m your favourite??” quizzed Dan, smiling childishly.\n“Yes,” said Hannah, flicking at some of her fine strands of hair.\n“Well, okay, I suppose I’ll go. Got a feeling it’s gonna be my lucky night, anyway.”\n“Go with it, then,” said Sean.\n20 minutes later, Michelle had dolled herself up - not that it was much of an improvement - and was out the door, waving goodbye to Hannah who was suppressing a slightly glum look. 30 minutes later, there was a knock at the door. Sean opened it to a businesslike-looking Bill, who was carrying a little zipped-up sports bag, and invited him in.\n“Jeez, that was close,” said Dan, greeting his old friend.\n“What was?” asked Bill.\n“Never mind,” said Sean. The old bitch just left, that’s all.\"\n“Oh.”\n“Anyway, what’s in that?”\n“Oh, right,” said Bill, unzipping it. He showed the contents one by one to his two buddies. “Blindfold… handcuffs… gag… wooden Victorian school cane replica… Victorian school dress from fancy shop… and this… is the script for a little period drama play I have written. We all have a part on it.” He beamed.\n“Err, right,” said Sean.\n“Sounds interesting,” said Dan, currently standing behind Hannah playing with her hair at her neck, and tickling an ear.\n“So, how long have we got?” asked Bill.\n“Till 11, at least. Four hours.”\nTHE END\nSee how the 3 men use their 4 hours, in part 14.\n",

      Little Hannah&#39;s Summer Of Molestation
    </h1>
    <div class="post-description">
      This is part 13 of the Paedophile Ring series. Hannah is a 9yo girl, brunette, pale and pretty, who has been systematically sexually molested for 18 months by her mother&#39;s live-in boyfriend, 35yo Sean. Recently he has brought in Dan, her 32yo schoolteacher and an old friend of his, 65yo Bill, to enjoy the fun. Sean is quite harsh, Dan is more loving, and Bill seems ok so far.

<p>Sean chuckled. &ldquo;Um, where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give her some say in that. Probably a guest house near a beach resort, or an isolated part of the countryside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer the latter,&rdquo; said Sean, firmly.</p>

She&rsquo;ll really like that, won&rsquo;t ya, Hannah?&rdquo; As it had turned out, Michelle was completely agreeable to having Mr Dan Hall, teacher, around a lot and &lsquo;close&rsquo; with her daughter. It gave Michelle, the useless chav, a feeling of &lsquo;status&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like it,&rdquo; said Hannah, mildy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will give me &lsquo;an Sean some us-time together.&rdquo; Sean suppressed a sigh, but was already thinking he might alleviate such boredom by probing just how far Michelle might &lsquo;go with&rsquo; his interest in child-sex. It went without saying she already knew Sean was &lsquo;at it&rsquo; with Hannah, and took it as &lsquo;one of those things&rsquo;. She probably suspected Dan was too, but she got a buzz from thinking of her daughter as the ultimate teacher&rsquo;s pet. Perhaps because she herself had had a very unloved childhood, even in any sexual sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;And will give Hannah a break from it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled crisply at his step-child. Michelle smiled too, but probably not realising the full meaning of break from it &lsquo;all&rsquo;. They had thought better of telling her about Bill. That could wait. He could easily be explained away as a drinking buddy of Sean or Dan, even some kind of educational support worker from the school - although such lies could cause complications - but basically Sean could not be bothered with introducing him yet. Hell, he only came once a week - in more ways than one, maybe - so it was simplest to keep him out of the picture. If he and Michelle crossed paths then it was a little bridge to be crossed when it happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awww, yeah,&rdquo; said Michelle, affectionately. Dan frowned in curiosity at her, wondering just how much she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you gonna win loads at bingo tonight, my darling?&rdquo; asked Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh, might not go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan pricked his ears up at that. Sean did not seem too rattled. He understood Michelle well enough to realise she merely didn&rsquo;t want to feel &lsquo;pushed out&rsquo; of the company of the refined Dan, and her rugged boyfriend. She was too dumb to twig that she was wanted out of the way for the arrival of a third man to have an evening of group fun with her 9-year-old daughter. Hannah, however, was listening to this part of the convo with interest: smart enough to understand she might be &rsquo;let off the hook&rsquo; for tonight, if her mother stayed around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, hell, go woman,&rdquo; said Sean, good-natured. &ldquo;You know you love it. Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll do the babysitting. Besides, I think Dan has some work to go through with her, and they want some peace and quiet. I might get on with some DIY, myself.. It&rsquo;s good for Hannah to stay with Dan. It helps her grow up into a right eloquent little princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan nodded affirmation at Michelle. &ldquo;Uh hum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awww, yeah,&rdquo; said Michelle. &ldquo;She does really love her favourite teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your favourite??&rdquo; quizzed Dan, smiling childishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hannah, flicking at some of her fine strands of hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, okay, I suppose I&rsquo;ll go. Got a feeling it&rsquo;s gonna be my lucky night, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go with it, then,&rdquo; said Sean.</p>
<p>20 minutes later, Michelle had dolled herself up - not that it was much of an improvement - and was out the door, waving goodbye to Hannah who was suppressing a slightly glum look. 30 minutes later, there was a knock at the door. Sean opened it to a businesslike-looking Bill, who was carrying a little zipped-up sports bag, and invited him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeez, that was close,&rdquo; said Dan, greeting his old friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Sean. The old bitch just left, that&rsquo;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, what&rsquo;s in that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right,&rdquo; said Bill, unzipping it. He showed the contents one by one to his two buddies. &ldquo;Blindfold&hellip; handcuffs&hellip; gag&hellip; wooden Victorian school cane replica&hellip; Victorian school dress from fancy shop&hellip; and this&hellip; is the script for a little period drama play I have written. We all have a part on it.&rdquo; He beamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Err, right,&rdquo; said Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds interesting,&rdquo; said Dan, currently standing behind Hannah playing with her hair at her neck, and tickling an ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, how long have we got?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till 11, at least. Four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE END</p>
