  "articleBody": "Veronica: The Beginning I was leaning on the doorjamb of the shop, looking down the street enjoying the mid morning sunshine, when Louise, my Manager said “penny for your thoughts.”\nI smiled \u0026 said “Veronica not Penny”. This then earned me a hit with an empty shoebox.\nSaying “Max Adams you are such a lazy bugger,” as she walked towards the counter, to finish serving one of my favourite customers.\n“You saw that Mary” I replied, “no respect at all from staff these days what is the world coming to” which provoked even more laughter \u0026 derision from the other customers, in the store. “Do you girls want a coffee my treat,” which then sent even more laughter echoing down the street.\nAs I marched out, tail between my legs to get the coffees I could not help thinking how much my life had changed in the two years since the death of my wife Elizabeth.\nShe had had breast cancer that she had then met head on, and beaten, with Chemo \u0026 a healthy lifestyle. However, she had changed and not for the better.\nShe had become more cynical and introverted. Which then caused the existing earlier problems in our marriage to resurface? I with 2 children from a previous relationship, and her inability to carry a baby to term had added to the stress.\nHer family did not help either, interfering \u0026 generally being a pain in the ass.\nEspecially her older brother Barry, as I found out later she had been on the phone too. Which had caused the head on collision that had ended her life?\nShe was due to sign an updated will, and was in the process of applying for a divorce. Which came as a great shock to me, when told of that fact, after her funeral?\nHer family had also applied to have her new unsigned will ratified, which I had fought \u0026 won in court , I then promptly told them all to fuck off \u0026 have a nice life, and to feel free not to contact me ever again.\nMy Mother’s family owned Beach side commercial property, and farming properties, which in the 12 years of our marriage had greatly increased in value.\nI also had worked before my marriage, in the Mining industry as an Electrician earning a six-figure income. I had joined with other family members, to turn 80 Acres of the swamp. Into a hugely successful, Canal estate.\nWhich had made in excess of $120 million for the family trust? Which, unbeknown to my wife I had a 25% share in. I still do not know why I did not tell her, we were very comfortable as it was. Beach side house, great cars, and no debts.\nHer family had been leeching off her for years, holidays, cars you name it.\nAs I had had this property before our marriage, I did not feel it necessary to tell her. Her constant whining about how successful my family was. Not telling her was satisfying.\nI also had a 50% share in a Mining lease, with my cousin Matt in the middle of nowhere, The Money Pit within the family, which had chewed up nearly $4 million dollars, over the years to keep it current. The use it or lose it clause.\nIn the previous 2 years, I had torn down the old store and built a 10-storey beach apartment complex including a 300 sq meter High-end shoe \u0026 clothing store, complete with hairdresser and coffee shop. Designed to, separate money from women, or their husband’s. It was going gangbusters.\nAh well I thought It is a Nice day and life is good. Little did I know it was to change totally for the better?\nI had seen her wandering in the early mornings before school, looking in shop windows, at dresses and clothing in general.\nShe was gawky, with big hands and feet, 5’ 7 inches or so, nearly a full head taller than most boys her age were. I found out later she was 15 � years old. With the then older style, school uniform, old shoes.\nHowever, she had an inner beauty. Graceful, like a giraffe is beautiful.\nCurly highlighted Blonde hair, those blue-sea green eyes. Long legs and B size boobs. (Think of Ella from Fame Girls) you get the picture.\nMe I am 43 years old 6’ 2 about 90 kg (200 lbs) I look after myself swimming and riding my bike. I have to I like my food too much.\nI had gone to pick up my paper and the new import fashion magazines that morning when I saw her put one in her backpack. She saw me looking at her; I put out my hand for it back. As I put it on the shelf, I said, “that’s not the best one to get, the new Marie Clair is better, if its fashion you’re after.”\nShe said “sorry” and started to tear up. “They are all so expensive.”\n“Tell me about it, besides your on camera” I replied. Looking over her shoulder and pointing at said camera!\n“What’s your name?”\n“Veronica Masters,” she replied.\n“Max Adams, Nice to meet you Miss Masters” I said smiling, and giving her a gentle hug.\n“Don’t worry you’re not in trouble, you would have been if you had taken it outside,” I said as we walked to pay for the magazines.\n“Put in on my account please Billy, Miss Veronica reckons you’re too damn expensive,” I said laughing.\n“She won’t be any trouble in the future will you?” I asked looking at her eyes.\n“No” she said looking back at me.\n“Good Girl” I said laughing, “you can buy me a coffee, you can afford that, I hope.”\n“Just” she replied smiling as we walked out to the store onto the street towards the nearest coffee shop.\nWe found a table in the morning sun out of the breeze.\n“What would you like Miss Veronica, Cappuccino, Mocha, have you had breakfast.”\n“Mocha please, No I’m good for breakfast,” she said.\n“I think you would be right tasty for breakfast I replied, “Not thinking.\n“Oh I’m so sorry,” I said as she blushed and laughed.\n“Brain in gear Ass in neutral Max, sorry Veronica.”\n“Have you had Breakfast?” I asked.\n“No.”\n“If Not why Not, what do you want because I’m starving and I won’t eat alone?”\n“A bacon and egg roll please,” she said looking in her purse.\n“Full breakfast for me please Marie, a Cappuccino \u0026 Mocha plus one of your fabulous bacon \u0026 egg rolls, for my lovely young guest”.\n“Put that away, it will be a cold day in hell before I allow a pretty girl to pay for her own breakfast,” I said.\n“I’m not Pretty, big feet, big hands” looking downcast.\n“Look at me Veronica, how old?”\n“I will be 16” in October she said before I could finish.\n“Good heavens, you’re still growing you Muppet”, using my favourite expression “your gawky ungainly, tripping over your own feet I suppose?” I asked.\n“How did you know that?” she replied with an amazed look on her face.\n“Doh been there, been that,” I replied. “One rock in a paddock \u0026 I would fall over it,” I said smiling.\n“You’re beautiful, like a giraffe is beautiful; neck isn’t as long, but who’s looking.”\n“You think so,” she said beaming back with a 1000-watt smile.\n“God Kiddo if I was 20 years younger your dad would be chasing me down the street with a shotgun, filled with bird shot” She started to tear up at that statement.\n“What’s up sweetheart, did I say something wrong,” I said.\n“I don’t know who my Dad was, my mum won’t tell me” she replied.\n“She doesn’t know or she won’t tell?” I asked.\n“Won’t tell,” she replied going quite.\nI started laughing quietly to myself, which caused a raised head to stare at me in surprise at the laughter.\n“Same with me my darling girl” as placing my hand on hers.\n“My Mum went to a US Embassy party with Friends of her over 40 years ago, and came away with a Present, Me, her and just turned, Eighteen, he was married, on assignment, Alcohol was involved , I didn’t find out who he was Till I was in my Mid 30s.”\n“I was moved from pillar to post with relatives till I was 4, then my Mums Older Brother \u0026 His wife took me to live with them till I was over 16.”\n“Mum had Gotten Married to an English Property owner whose wife had died and I was surplus to requirements.”\n“I love my Mum; don’t like her much, I really loved My Aunty Nancy \u0026 Uncle Pete who looked after me.”\n“At 16 I started to butt heads, knew it all knew nothing, Went bush as an Apprentice electrician with a Mining company, got a girl pregnant at 17, went away came back, got her pregnant again. Stayed away made a shit load of money.”\n“Came up here to help out my other Uncle \u0026 Aunt, Got Married, made a shitload More Money, Wife died, talking to you.”\nAs she stared at me like a rabbit in a spotlight, mouth agape!\n“Sorry you were saying?” as breakfast arrived.\nMarie our waiter just stood \u0026 stared at us both.\nMe I could not believe I had said so much to someone I had only just met.\nI then looked at them both with a firm stare and said, “That info is not to be repeated around town, you feel me,” using another of my favourite expressions from the TV series The Wire.\nThey both nodded in affirmation, Marie just stood still staring at the Veronica whose head framed by the early morning sunshine. Looking like a Botticelli painting.\n“My good she is so beautiful,” she said.\n“You’ve just noticed.” I stood up, to race inside, to get my camera from my backpack, to take the photo.\n“Stay there sit still don’t move a muscle, be back in a second,” I said as I dashed off to get my backpack.\nCamera out, focus, shot in frame echoed in my head, bang, bang, bang, as I fired off 3 quick shots to complete the photo.\n“Here we go girls have a look at that” passing over the camera for them to see the result.\n“Oh My God “was the reaction as they viewed the results in the camera.\n“That’s not me” Veronica exclaimed looking at the screen, “I don’t look like that.”\n“Yes you do” I replied smiling.\n“I told you, you were beautiful, Missy Moo, you just don’t know it, which makes you even more beautiful.”\n“But my nose is too big, and my teeth are funny, and my eyes are well, a little bit crooked” she said.\n“Yep to all of that.”\n“It’s those imperfections that make us what we are,” I said softly.\n“Sought of like the Mole on Cindy Crawford’s face” which then got me blank stares from them both.\n“God Youth, it’s wasted on the Young, One of the first supermodels early 80, s \u0026 90, s, world fame, and fortune” shaking my head in disgust at their lack of knowledge.\n“Eat your Roll it’s going to go cold, and you Marie, sit here for a second. I have something for you” smiling as I placed my arm round her waist.\nShe sat on the chair next to me as I gave her an envelope I had taken from my backpack.\n“Happy belated Birthday Kiddo sorry I missed it.”\nI had been away Overseas in Europe, buying stock for the next season and had missed her 21st.\nThe scream that followed the opening of the envelope, echoed round the courtyard, and resulted in heads turning in all directions to see what had happened.\n“Oh Max, God I love you, it’s too much” She cried jumping and shrieking.\n“A lot of women say that to me” which resulted in an outburst of laughter from the assembled diners.\n“A round the world ticket, Business class, O M G.”\n“Are you sure that’s all there is in the envelope?” I asked.\nShe turned it up, and a Black Visa card fell onto the table, she picked it up.\nHer name was on the card, Marie Anne Jennings.\n“There’s 35K on there for your expenses and tuition at the International Food College in Milan, The next course is due to start in September. So you and Toby can have a bit of a holiday before he starts at Fiat with his Master Mechanics Course for Ferrari.”\n“Maronello is just down the Autostrada from there, I have organized a 2 bedroom apartment for your stay through my contacts in Milan, Mates rates so it’s all good. The amount I’ve spent buying there, I thought it was the least they could do for me” I said tearing up. She hugged me tears streaming down her cheeks.\n“Thank you, Thank you, Thank you” she replied.\n“No problem, don’t worry I took it out from your tips I didn’t pay you, cause your family Kiddo, OK.”\nWhich, as a fitting reward for my previous good deeds? Earned me punch on the arm.\n“Ouch, kiss it better” I replied. I then planted a big wet sloppy kiss on her lips.\n“Go On Bugger off and get our coffees they had better not be cold.”\nVeronica just stared open mouthed at me.\n“Close your gob and eat your roll Missy Moo, you’ll catch flies.”\n‘Uh Oh here comes trouble” looking in the direction of the Bistros doorway.\nMarie’s step mother Stephanie arrived at our table followed closely behind by her husband Brian and their two girls. Lauren aged 16 � and Holly aged 12.\n“Have you lost your mind?” said Stephanie “It’s too much Max.”\n“Marie didn’t think so” as I lifted Holly onto my lap.\n“Hi Gorgeous how’s my favourite 12 year old Jennings” as she snuggled into my shoulder.\nStephanie then saw Veronica sitting opposite “Oh, sorry I didn’t know you had company” she said.\n“Veronica, Stephanie, Stephanie, Veronica.”\nThey smiled at each other and shook hands.\n“Veronica”, Brian he’s the tall Curly haired Gent and the one on my lap is Holly,” I said introducing them. Brian’s shaved head glowed in the sunlight.\n“And last but not least, Lauren” I said turning to Lauren who stood glaring daggers at Veronica.\n“Hi” Veronica squeaked as she saw the look on Laurens face.\n“What’s hanging out of your ass Miss?” I asked Lauren as her Mother finally saw her expression.\n“Wouldn’t you like to Know” she snarled.\nI quietly placed Holly on the ground and grabbing Lauren gently, by her arm, looked directly into her eyes and said, “Care to run that by me again.”\n“Wouldn’t you Like to Know,” came the snarling reply.\nWith one fluid movement, I placed her over my lap, her uniform skirt up her back, her white panty clad backside in the breeze, and I pulled her knickers down, and delivered four hard stinging slaps to her bottom.\nAs the sound of the slaps faded away into the background, you could have heard a pin drop. Both her parents stood stock-still open mouthed.\n“Again how are we?” I asked as I pulled her panties up over her bottom and stood her up.\n“Sorry” she tearfully replied.\n“I love you, but I don’t take that sought of crap from anyone OK,” I said kissing her.\n“Apologize to Veronica, and your Mum and Dad,” I said.\n“Sorry Mummy, Daddy, Sorry Veronica,” she said giving each one a hug.\n“Come here Kiddo,” as I enveloped her in a great big bear Hug.\n“You’re still my Favourite Big Jennings Girl.”\n“OK sweetheart, still love me?” I asked smiling, at her tear stained face.\n“It’s all good Uncle Max” smiling and hugging me back.\n“OK folks the shows over, nothing to see, move along” I said jokingly to the crowd.\nI handed her my car keys and said while looking at her parents who at this time had regained their composure.\n“Bring my car out of the car park and run it up to the apron before the footpath, OK, not on the footpath just before” She looked at her parents as her mum nodded her head in affirmation.\nShe squealed and Jumped into my arms again squealing “thank you, thank you, thank you.”\n“Treat them mean, to keep them keen!” I exclaimed once again getting a laugh from the other diners.\nShe grabbed her bag ready to tear off “Sweetie,” I said.\n“You might need to adjust your bum” her skirt was caught in her bag and her cute derriere was exposed to the delight of all.\n“Shit” she exclaimed as she hastily rearranged her skirt and panties as she went to wash her face and tidy up.\n“I’ll drop you off at school as well Veronica, if you want me to?” I asked.\n“That would be great” she replied smiling and shaking her head in amazement at what had just occurred.\nLauren reappeared at the doorway looking unaffected, wearing a smile a mile wide on her face.\n“You Miss, toilet now” I said looking directly at Veronica “scoot, go, you don’t want to be late, Passenger side front seat as well, OK” as I sat back down to finish my now growing colder breakfast.\n“Yes Uncle Max” was the cheeky reply.\nI smiled as I shook my head at this morning’s turn of events.\nLooking at both Laurens parents, who had at that moment, just sat down with a coffee.\nI replaced Holly in my lap to finish my breakfast and coffee.\n“You can stay here with me Missy, I don’t want any distractions, or you getting run over OK,” I said hugging her.\nStephanie looked over and smiled as she said, “Lauren has been just such a shit lately I really could sell her into slavery.”\n“You don’t have enough money for them to take her” I replied getting another laugh.\n“And you Miss Holly Go Lightly will not tattle about what’s been said here, OK?” I said looking at her.\n“Or over my lap you’ll go as well” hugging her gently.\n“Mu-mm” she replied as she stuffed a piece of bacon into her mouth which she had stolen off my plate.\n“Go On, get cleaned up, toilet as well, Missy” I said as I planted a big bacon Kiss on her lips.\n“What’s the story with Veronica?” Stephanie asked quietly aware of all the listening ears around.\n“Well I really don’t know what I’m doing or where, or, if anywhere it’s going. But there is just something magical about her” I said as I showed them the photos I had taken earlier.\n“Good Heavens would you look at that, she looks like an angel” Stephanie replied.\n“Wowser” was all Brian could mutter, “How old is she?” He said under his breath.\n“15 � going on 30 Like most girls, as you both well know, having one of your own” I said.\nI then said something that had just entered my subconscious “I think she might be the One.”\nBoth sets of eyebrows rose up in shock. “Really,” both said in unison.\n“Yea really, Ah I must away, Time to get these Kidletts off to get some of that there book learning.”\n“Come only Curly Girl get those little legs Moving,” I said as Holly came bounding out the Door.\nI could hear my Range Rover is coming up the ramp from the Underground parking space of the apartment block. On the opposite side of the road, further down from the Bistro.\nMeanwhile Lauren \u0026 Veronica where bonding in that Mysterious way that women or girls in this case Do.\n“Sorry I was such a bitch said Lauren It’s been a Rough couple of weeks, Exams, and my parents are making me save up for my own car. It will take forever I will be 60 before I can afford one,” she said.\n“At least you will get cheap insurance and senior discount on parking,” Veronica answered back.\nLauren just missed a pillar whist backing out of the parking bay from laughing that hard.\n“Stop it you Bitch or I will have an accident,” she said.\n“I thought you had an accident when he was smacking you on the arse, your face got all dreamy looking like you were getting off on it,” Veronica said.\nLauren Braked hard in shock, “I didn’t show did it, she said quietly.”\n“It did, but only if you knew what to look for,” Veronica said Staring at Lauren intently. “Who is he?” she asked Lauren.\n“You don’t Know about Max Adams, what cave have you been living in?” she said with amazement in her Voice.\n“A cave in Melbourne, I have only just moved here in the past 5 weeks,” she said.\n“Sorry My Bad,” said Lauren.\n“He’s Really Rich, Smoking hot, funny as all buggery, Kind, generous and I love him to bits,” she said smiling back at Veronica.\n“Oh, he’s also got a really big Willy” she added Moving her hands about 8’ apart, as a look of abject misery appeared on Veronica s face.\n“Oh,” was all Veronica could get out.\n“So you really love him, heaps then,” Veronica added.\n“Yep sure do Heaps and heaps?” she said with a smug look on her face.\n“He’s My Father,” said Lauren smirking outrageously. A split second after Veronica registered that statement she launched herself at Lauren Tickling and hitting her whilst she negotiated the ramp up to the street.\n“Stop it, or I’ll crash the car you stupid cow,” she said while screaming with laughter.\n“He’s your father, I thought Brian was your father,” she said as Lauren finally brought the Range Rover to a halt.\n“No Brian’s my dad, Max is my father Holly’s as well.” She replied as they watched me walk up the street towards where they we had parked.\n“Brian married my mum 20 years ago he had 2 Kids Daniel, \u0026 Marie mum lost one Baby, then Brian got Testicular Cancer and had to have both his testacies removed” she said quietly.\n“They asked Max if he would help them have a couple of Kids He said yes and turned up with a piece of 4 x 2 timber. Apparently, they all cracked up in laughter as my Dad Brian is like a horse 12’’ and Max said he didn’t want to fall into Mums pussy, I came along and 4 years later Holly arrived. I heard them talking about having a couple more babies Max said do I have To I’m still trying to recover from the last time we tried.”\n“He really loves My Mum and Brian they have been best friends forever,” she said as she opened the door to go round to get into the back seat.\n“How’s the Bum Chum?” I said as I walked up to open the Door for Holly.\n“Hope you haven’t been telling too many stories about me to Miss Veronica” I said.\n“No, It’s all good Uncle Max we’ve been talking about fashion,” she replied.\n“Just as well then” I said as I climbed into the driver’s seat.\nAt that moment, Louise my Manager appeared out from the side passage with some bags for the shop.\n“Hello what do we have here” she said looking at Veronica perched up in the front seat with the two girls in the back, an amused expression on her face.\n“I’m collecting orphan and abandoned children for sale into servitude and a life of abject misery,” I said.\n“Good I have 2 more you can collect at the Bus Stop,” she said laughing as she stepped around to the Driver’s side door.\n“Louise meet Veronica Masters, Veronica meet Louise Conner, my manager and my Number one go to girl” I said.\n“Lovely to meet you, they both chorused!” With resulted in, laughter from all of us.\n“See you in about 20 or so better make that 40. I’ll pick up Charlie I’ve Missed Him,” I said.\n“You’ll be cleaning up after him if he makes a mess or pees all over the stock,” she said kissing me on the cheek.\n“Go on, some of us have to work for a living” she said as she walked away to the rear entrance of the shop.\n“Charlie is my dog Veronica in case you’re wondering he’s a lot better behaved than some in this car who I won’t mention,” I said looking in the rear view mirror as two tongues appeared.\n“OK kids let’s, rock and roll,” I said as I turned Usher up on the stereo Music flooded the car as we entered the street.\nVeronica s Face registered amazement as I turned into a One Way Street with a No Entry sign, stating Council and Police exempted, as two police officers exited their car at the local Police Beat adjacent to the road.\n“Well if it isn’t Constable Plod \u0026 his trusty sidekick Big Ears,” I said out the window as I pulled up to a halt.\nThey turned and laughed as they both walked to the car. “Hi girls, Hi Smarty what’s happening,” they asked.\nThe girls both said Hi Uncle Dave, Hi Sergeant Carter as they walked to the Drivers window.\n“Dave Sutton, Sergeant Ben Carter, and Miss Veronica Masters” I said introducing them to Veronica in the passenger’s seat.\n“Ah our little Fashion Magazine Bandit” said Ben “It’s not going to become a habit I hope Veronica,” he said looking over his glasses at her blushing face opposite.\n“No sir “she replied.\n“Good Girl, I thought that might be the case,” he said walking back towards the office.\n“Don’t be all Day Dave” he said looking back at us.\n“I will talk to you at lunchtime Smarty,” said Dave.\nAs he walked past the Car, he saw the Council sticker on the window “you’re a bloody burglar he laughed as he walked towards the police beat office.\n“What was that all about Uncle Max?” Lauren asked from the back.\nI turned towards Veronica to see if she would answer the question.\n“I was going to lift a Fashion Magazine and your Uncle stopped me from doing something really stupid,” she said quietly.\n“Oh well that was lucky,” was the response.\nI had pulled up before a Mob of school Kids I pipped the horn and 50 heads looked up. I saw Louise’s two boys Mike 17 and Timmy 14.\n“Hello Little Boys would you like a ride to school,” I said in my best creepy voice.\n“Yes please was the reply with laughter from the rest of them.\nI have room for two I said to the assembled Mob What about you Inky, I said to a tall buxom 17-year-old Goddess.\nOK Uncle Max Count me in.\nAs she walked to the back Timmy and Holly Clambered through to the back row of seats.\nOK wait for the bus then, lets go I said setting off just as the bus pulled into the Bus Zone.\n“Hi Stan,” I said to the bus driver. “How is it going old Buddy.”\n“Good He Replied, You?”\n“Great mate it’s a good day to be alive.”\n“I looked at the gaggle of kids boarding the Bus You Lot Behave OK I said.\n“No problems Mr Adams, glad to hear it”. I replied to no one in particular.\n“I will drop you lot of first, then Veronica last OK Gang”, I said over Pit bull.\n“Sorry Inga, Veronica, Inga Veronica…My bad.”\n“Hi was the shy smiles all round, Hey Inky get your dad to give me a bell, don’t worry I will see him this morning is he in the office or at home”. He’s in the office today he got a meeting with a group of interstate investors looking to buy farmland on the river she said.\nWhich I nodded too, we continued the 10 minute drive to their school and as I drove up into the gates of the Hastings Christian Grammar School.\nVeronica looked at the new buildings and oval, in stunned silence, as a raft of foreign cars were disgorging children of all sizes and colours.\n“You lot have a great day see you all this arvo” I said as I kissed them all goodbye Not Mike though at 17 he was too cool for school.\n“OK Miss Veronica back to the real world” I said as a group of heads turned and watched us depart out the gate, back onto the main road towards the local state school.\nAs I approached the school precinct I pulled off into a council storage area, I looked over at Veronica; she had a funny look on her face.\n“It’s all good Veronica I just want to have a quiet talk with not too many prying ears and Eyes Ok,” I said.\nOK, she said smiling back.\nI pulled up in the shade put the car in park and looked at her “what did you and Lauren talk about,” I asked gently.\n“You” she replied quietly.\nAh, I said, “I thought that might be the case, what did she say.”\n“She said that you were her, and Holly’s dad and that she loved you, and you were really nice?”\n“That’s all you sure Not about money or how I’m so fantastic in bed Dam I will have to get a new publicist.\nI said Laughing. “Did she talk about money?” I asked gently prodding for an answer.\n“Only that you had lots, and you were really generous \" she said hanging her head; “she’s not going to get into trouble is she?”\n“No I replied its good, now about you Miss, you don’t have to answer these next questions, but if you do that would make me happy OK?”\n“No Pressure” I said as I gently lifted her face to look into mine.\n“Do you have a boyfriend?”\n“No,” she said.\n“Do you want one?” I said looking back into her face.\n“Me, you want me for your girlfriend, why I’m just a Kid!” She exclaimed.\n“No you’re a young lady with tremendous potential, and I believe we could have a fantastic time together. I replied smiling at her.\n“You mean sex and all,” she said smiling back at me.\n“Yep, but If you want to wait till your old enough, that’s OK as well, I won’t do anything to harm or hurt you OK” I said taking her hand in mine.\n“If this goes the way I think it’s going, I’m talking Marriage babies the whole ball of wax Veronica?” I said quietly.\n“Married, Me, Why? You could have any girl you want; I saw how they all looked at you at breakfast,” she said.\n“I know that’s why I want you, it’s sought of like your photo, and you think you’re not beautiful but you are, and all you have to do for me, is Love me,” I said as my eyes started to tear up.\n“I’ve got money, success friends \u0026 family that I love dearly but I want More Kids, Lots of them,” I said with a chuckle.\n“How many she asked?”\n“10 or 12,” I replied.\n“10 or 12?” she said her eyes as big as a dinner plate.\n“You won’t have to have all of them, we’d share that around? I said as I looked at the dashboard clock.\n“How are we traveling for time?”\n“OK. I have a study period at 9.15” she said,” it’s only 8.45 now”.\n“Laurens Mum wants a couple more, I’d like to have a couple with Louise, and I would have to find a couple more. Unless of course you want to have 6 or 7”, I said laughing.\n“Wow,” she said, “What a rush,” as I grabbed a cold Coke out of the console fridge unit.\n“Diet, Normal or Zero,” I said “Zero” she replied.\n“We haven’t even kissed, and here we are discussing having 6 babies, that’s just so bizarre,” she said quietly.\nI reached over and placed my hand on her face, drawing her towards me, and kissed her gently full on the lips, tasting coke in the process.\n“Wow,” she said as I pulled away her eyes big and sparkling.\n“Yea wow back at you,” I said.\n“Can we do that again?” She said starting to breathe harder.\n“For about the next 40 years,” I replied, looking into her face.\nShe Looked at me in shock. “You really mean it don’t you?”\nYep, I said.\n“You’ll be Veronica Adams, people will be saying, you know I went to school with her?” I said jokingly she just smiled.\n“God what a rush!” She said as she took another mouth full of drink.\nShe turned and looked at me. “We’ll be married then, not just living together?”\n“Yep, when you turn 18, you will be Mrs Max Adams if that is what you want,” I said.\n“These other girls who are they, friends, old lovers, or what?” she asked looking intently at my face.\n“I don’t know, I haven’t really thought it out that far” I replied, amazed at the depth of the question.\n“Would I get a choice, or a say in which they were?” She asked tucking her legs up under her Bottom.\n“As I would want to be able to get along with them, I don’t want any dramas with people who would cause us trouble,” she said, taking another mouthful of Zero.\n“I have had enough of that,” she said after swallowing.\n“You and I both” I replied. We really should be going it’s after 9 already.”\nShe looked directly at my face, and moved forward and kissed me hard on the lips, it was ragged, but fantastic all the same.\n“I don’t really need to be back in class till 1.45, can we go somewhere private, so we can finish this conversation,” she whispered.\nMy heart just about went out through my chest, along with a big rush of blood to my ever-hardening prick.\n“I’ll take you back to my house if that’s OK, it’s about 15 mins from here, up the coast road,” I said.\nI eased the car into the traffic, and heading up the beach road to Hastings Park towards where my house was. Veronica’s eyes bugged out of her head as she saw the size of it. As I pulled up to the gated entrance, three stories high white, with a blue tile roof, Beautiful gardens and all.\nI eased the car into the sunken garage alongside my old SL Mercedes Coupe and Bike; she opened the door and followed me up the flight of stairs into the main living area overlooking the pool and the back garden.\n“My god this is so pretty!” She gasped as she walked towards the back veranda \u0026 the pool area. “It’s freaking massive!”\n“Not bad, hey you like I like it.”\n“Lots,” was her reply.\n“Come on I’ll give you the 2 dollar tour, lounge dining, huge galley kitchen, overlooking the sunken living area, the ceilings where 10ft high which added to the open feel of the house.\nWe climbed upstairs into the third storey, guest side 5 beds 3 baths and across the walkway towards the master bed and en suite bathroom with an office area leading off to the side.\nThe master bedroom ran the whole of one side of the 3rd floor with verandas front and back overlooking the pool you could see the ocean from the back and from the front the hills, the upstairs was designed in an H pattern master bed on one side guests the other, with the connecting walkway joining both. From the walkway, you overlooked the front entry and the living area to the back.\nI had turned from opening the doors to let in the breeze and fresh air, Veronica was taking off her Dress and kicking off her shoes. Shocked, that didn’t even cover one tenth of my emotions.\nBlood rushed from my chest, to my prick, it sprang from � hard from the kiss in the car, to bullet proof in no time.\n“Are you sure?” I asked as she took off her socks, I saw tears in her eyes as I walked towards her drinking in her face she B size boobs with her nipples sticking up like erasers.\n“My god you are just so beautiful,” I gasped as I kissed her eyes, her lips, her cheeks tasting her tears, bacon and Girl taste as well.\n“I will probably go to hell for this,” I said as I undid her Bra, Her boobs pooped into view Grapefruit size, beautiful full nipples standing firm and proud.\nShe unzipped my shirt as I undid the drawstring on my pants; she lowered them over my buttocks, as my fully erect penis popped out of my underpants.\nThe head a purple colour, glistening with pre cum, as she gently rubbed the end of with a wet finger, which she then put back in her mouth covered with juice.\nI kissed her neck and nibbled on her right nipple holding it and rolling it with my tongue. She was trying to get my underpants off with not a lot of success.\n“Need a hand,” I asked letting go of her nipple from my teeth.\nShe shivered a Yes as I pulled them down and my prick and balls sprang free from their confining prison. She had started to pull her own panties off, only to have one side down so it was like a slow reveal of her pussy and mound.\nI finally dropped mine as she dropped hers, we both gasped at what we saw before us.\nHer mound covered by a thin carpet of dark blond hair fanning out from her vulva, her lips sticking out like petals on a just opened rose, and her clit the size of a peanut swollen an enlarged its head making its way out from its hood.\nShe saw the look on my face and tears started flowing down her cheeks. Her hands went to cover her pussy.\n“It’s ugly,” she said.\n“Who told you that?” I gasped, “I will have him shot, it is the most beautiful pussy I have ever seen. It’s perfect, just like you.\n“You’re not just saying that,” she said quietly placing her head on my chest. I just picked her up and carried her to my King size bed placing her in the middle I covered her face with kisses, tasting the trail of her tears.\nI marveled at the arch of her neck, graceful. I stroked and kissed it along the hairline.\nWhen I finally finished kissing her neck, I had reached her breasts. Sucking each erect nipple in turn, savouring the taste, texture.\nHer breathing got deeper, heavier in its volume as I continued down her body.\nI listened to her ragged breathing. I started kissing her belly, button, nibbling, sucking, and biting tasting the sweat that had formed at the top of her pubic bone. I could see her pussy slick with her juices, the smell was almost overpowering.\nI had finally reached the Promised Land. The first lick of her vulva caused her back to arch, and a high pitch squeal, the second, third and subsequent licks got an ever-great response. She was keening with a high-pitched hum her hips thrusting into my face and tongue.\nWhen my tongue parted her labia and caressed her clit, she went ballistic. Sought of like the warning on a firework rocket, “light blue touch paper and retire”.\nWhat I got was head clamped to pussy suck hard, cum heaps.\nHer pussy exploded in a rush of juices it was coming from every pore in her vagina her lips just kept unfolding, her clit was red and engorged like nothing I had seen before.\nThe taste of her was, like the clearest sweetest nectar you could ever imagine. The more I sucked the more I got, the more I got the more I sucked.\nVeronica bathed in sweat, keening at an incredible level and generally having a hell of a time. If you will, excuse the pun.\nI was in Awe.\nI stopped and looked at her, my face awash with her fluids and asked if she was OK?\nShe just reached down, pulled me to her face, and kissed me hard on the lips mashing her face, lips, and tongue together with mine. My poor prick by this time had gone that purple blue shade you get with a bruise. It ached. Pre cum was flowing like a tap from the slit It looked ready to explode.\n“God that was the most wonderful feeling I have ever had she said what did you do to me.”\nMe I said, “I just hung on an enjoyed the ride” which earned me a punch and laughter. Wow was what I got in return.\n“You ready for the main meal miss” I said while kissing her gently on the neck.\nMu mm was her reply “let me put it in” said Veronica finally getting a closer look at my engorged prick.\n“God it’s big” she said grasping it with her right hand. “It’s so thick as well.”\n“It’s the only one I’ve got here at the moment,” I said, “so it will have to do.”\nShe placed the head at the entrance to her opening, her labia wrapping around it like a present, as I pushed down she pushed up, and it entered her canal an inch at a time her juices causing it to glide smoothly along the tight confines of her teenage pussy.\nI had about 3 inches in when she gave a slight jump “you OK my darling”, I asked uh huh she said that’s as far as anyone has been. What no dildos, fruit or other people. No, she replied smiling it’s all you from now on.\n“Veronica Marshal the undiscovered pussy I exclaimed, “Causing even more laughter and another 2 inches to disappear into the sweet wet confines of her body. I backed out two and fed in another four.\nIt was just about all my poor prick could take. I looked at her face, eyes closed, tongue flicking her lips, and a look of utter bliss.\nGod she was just so beautiful it hurt. I finally fed the last 2 inches into her tight cunt; she opened her eyes with an amazed look as she felt my balls and pubic hair against her mound.\n“Wow, is it all in?” she asked.\n“Yep that’s all I’ve got for you today Missy,” I replied. You OK?\n“Mumm,” was what I got back in return. I quickened my pace 4 out 4 in, 6 out 6 in, till I was taking it just about all out except for the head.\nHer flaps, Inner and outer had formed a perfect seal around the head of my prick, it’s distended out and caved back in sliding along the length of my prick like velvet. The feeling was indescribable wonderfully good.\nI was slamming just about the full length in and out when she went off again, if I thought the first one was loud this one was off the decibel scale she screamed like a banshee and shook like an epileptic my god what had I discovered in this 15 � year old girl.\nI fucked her hard through that orgasm and halfway through her next I unloaded the full contents of my poor swollen balls into the tight confines of her teenage pussy. I had shoved hard against her pubic bone I swear I could see her stomach muscles pulse as my prick fired Rope after rope of hot thick cum into her.\nShe squealed as her pussy gripped my prick, in a vice milking it of its entire load until it started to seep past the confines of her flaps.\nI looked at her lying underneath me drenched in sweat, leaking cum and her own fluids, tears started rolling down my cheeks dropping onto her lips she looked at me with that serene smile on her face and sighed.\n“Max Adams, I love you with all my heart if you want 10 babies, I’ll have 10 babies but let’s just have 2 or 3 for a start and work back from there OK my darling.\n“OK Missy Moo you got a deal as I rolled onto my side to cuddle her.\n“Don’t expect it to be like this every time we make love,” I said.\n“Why not?” asked Veronica as she cuddled up into my arms?\n“Well I said with best cheesy smile,” I was a bit out of practice and well, you don’t really know what you’re doing so I reckon It should be a lot better as we get more practice.”\n“You rotten shit,” she yelled as she launched herself at me covering me with punches and kisses in equal measure, laughing all the time. I can’t believe I love you, you lecherous old goat.\nMe I just hugged her closer and said, “I can’t believe you love me too, and I resemble that statement.”\nI don’t know about you but in hungry and sweaty and I bet you are as well.\nI picked her up and carried her to the toilet I plonked her on the seat and walked out and turned on the shower I could hear her peeing as I adjusted the water temperature.\n“My God Max look at this.”\nAs she opened her legs a river of cum cascaded out her pussy.\n“It hasn’t stopped,” she said. As I looked into the bowl, it was full of cum.\n“Well it had been a while,” I said.\n“How long is a While?” Veronica asked wiping herself.\n“I don’t really know about 4 or 5 days since I last came.”\n“Wow, I hope my damn pill keeps working or I’ll be the Hastings version of “Octo Mum,” she said as she stepped into the shower.\nI went to the toilet and followed her in, grabbing the Raspberry body lotion to wash her back and front as well.\n“On the Pill that’s probably a good Idea,” I said. “I can see the headlines Hastings Councillor in Teenage Love Tryst as they carted me off to jail.”\n“You’re a Councillor,” she said no wonder everybody knows you, I suppose we will have to be careful around other people.\n“Yep just, be a little bit circumspect in what we say or do. Just hang with Lauren and once we are a couple I say I met you through my daughter.”\n“So Lauren is going to pimp me out hey, I wonder how much she will charge and how much I will make,” she said smiling.\nI just looked at her and said” Well I’ll just make it a package deal You, Lauren and Holly, should turn over a few dollars.”\n“I’ll tell her you said that,” she laughed. “Poor Holly rented out by her lecherous old Father,” as she soaped my prick in her hands.\nIt started to swell and grow under her touch. “Look what I found mum, can I keep it?” she squealed.\n“I know where it will fit,” I said as I turned her face to the wall and started to feed it into her from behind as she bent over.\n“God that feels so good, it feels Huge.”\n“Glad you like It Mamm happy to oblige,” I said as I steadily fed over half in one long plunge.\n“Ah Jesus I’m going split in two!” she said pushing back as another 2 inches disappeared into her. I turned the shower off as I Shoved the final 2 inches up to the crack of her arse.\nHer pink rosebud puckered as I sawed in and out of the tight confines of her teenage cunt. I could see her reflection in the shower screen as she massaged her clit, she screamed as I placed my well-lubed index finger in her puckered Arsehole.\n“What are you doing back there?” she panted.\n“I can take it out if you like as I massaged it back and forward?”\n“It feels weird, but good, all at the same time.”\n“Just wait till I stick my tongue up there,” I said.\n“Oh God here I cum!” she said as I felt her pussy squeeze tight and her arsehole even tighter. She squealed her cum into the cubicle as I tried to drive her through the wall with my Prick. As I plunged harder against her arse as by balls unloaded another massive dose of cum up her teen cunt.\nI pulled out and lifted her up into a standing position as I turned the shower back on to clear out her cum drenched pussy. I pulled her flaps apart as I guided the shower head up to her open canal.\nA mixture of water and cum came flushing out; she came again from the water on her clit.\n“God you are such a Cum Slut,” I said smiling.\nHer hand grasped my balls, as she looked me square in the face. Her blue eyes angry like the sea. That is something you had better only call me with love in your heart. Because say it any other way and I’ll cut your balls in your sleep.\nI squeezed her hand on my balls, then moved it to her face, and gently kissed her eyes ears neck and finally her lips. I grabbed her mound and Said “you had better do a really quick job, because otherwise you will be wearing this, as a scarf.”\nI will make you this promise I will Never Do anything to hurt you, that doesn’t mean I won’t make fun of you. That’s just me don’t worry I make more Fun of Me than I do anyone else.\nI held her face and kissed her gently then harder as her breathing got deeper; I moved my face onto her cunt and sucked cum back into my mouth causing her to collapse once again.\n“God I can’t believe how much I love you,” I said looking into her tear filled eyes.\n“Same for me, sorry I got upset”\n“You little shit you beat me to it” I said Kissing her again, hard.\nShe melted into my arms a Final warm rinse and we stepped out of the shower to dry off.\nWe went down stairs in our cotton robes Veronica with a towel round her hair.\n“What’s your poison my sweet. What do you fancy? Pasta, Steak or Fish?” I asked as I stood looking in the fridge.\n“Pasta, please Max.” Pasta it is then. I could hear Charlie dog whining down the hallway in the laundry, his nose pressed through the bars of the security gate.\n“I had better go and check on the prisoner,” I said as I placed a big pot of water on to boil with the other fry pan on low heat.\n“Hi Charlie Dog what you have been up to Big Dog?” he jumped up and down tongue hanging out with excitement to see me.\n“Veronica, Charlie, Charlie Veronica,” as I formally introduced them.\n“What a really cute looking dog,” said Veronica. “What is he?”\n“Part Bichon part Aussie Terrier,” I replied.\n“Oh his fur is so soft. I thought it would be wiry,” she said patting him. “Charlie, Calm Down or you will go back in,” I said in a firm voice.\nHe finally settled down as we walked back into the kitchen to get lunch underway he sat at the end of the bench area near the stools on a mat.\n“He won’t come into the kitchen area will he?” Veronica asked.\n“Not if he knows what’s good for him,” I replied cutting up the bacon and sun-dried tomatoes’ to place with the crushed garlic into the pan. “Anchovies?” I asked, holding the jar for Veronica to see.\n“No,” she shuddered.\n“You have no idea what you are missing out on!” I said as I chopped them up to leave on the board “Grab the block of Parmesan out of the Fridge along with that wrapped packet,” I said.\nI held the wrapping to my nose and sniffed a look of bliss on my face. “What’s in there that has sent you into to Orbit?” Veronica asked.\n“This,” I said unwrapping it. “You eat ham?” I asked.\n“Yep. Love it,” she smiled back.\n“OK Miss, close your eyes and open your mouth and prepare to have your taste buds ruined for any other ham.”\nShe closed her eyes; I placed a piece of Ham in her mouth as she started to chew her eyes popped open in amazement.\n“WOW that is freaking awesome. What is it?”\n“Imported Spanish Jamon ham, the pigs are fed acorns and the flavor goes into the Ham. Not Bad hey!” I said smiling back as I handed her another piece.\n“Expensive,” she said.\n“Criminal,” I replied handing her the packet. “$122 per Kg.”\n“That’s just wrong on any level,” she said.\n“Whoever is importing that should be taken out and shot that is just so wrong,” she said with all the indignity that only a teen could muster.\n“Why?” I asked smiling back.\n“It just is,” she said as my question finally hit home, she looked at me and looked at the Packet. “Imported under license by Smart Industries Ultimo Sydney 2000,” she read on the label.\n“That’s you,” she squealed as my shit-eating grin finally registered.\n“Why?” I asked.\n“Because Laurens Uncle Dave called you “Smarty or Smart Man” I don’t quite remember,” she said.\n“Guilty as charged. Will I get that Gun so you can shoot me?” I asked smiling and kissing her on the lips.\n“But why?” she said finally wising up to my show and tell routine.\n“Doh Money, lots and lots of money” I said.\n“At $122 per kg,” she said.\n“Yep I can’t keep up with the demand,” I said.\n“But won’t someone else import it instead of you.”\n“Not unless they want their asses sued of them they won’t, a couple tried it on, I now own a factory in Ultimo as a result of their stupid fucking Lawyers, I asked them, then told them, then sued them. Poor bastards. It had been in their family for over 65 years,” I said.\n“Oh,” was all she said.\n“It’s ready,” I said placing some of the anchovy’s with some cream in the frying pan and mixing it in. I lifted some on a fork for her to taste. “Trust Me,” was all I said.\n“Yum,” was what I got back in return as I put the rest in and mixed in the cream to finish it off. Grated Parmesan to finish done.\nI gave Charlie dog a piece of cheese and Ham. They were gone in seconds flat.\n“Go On Bugger off that’s all your getting,” as I finally handed him another piece of cheese. “Outside Now, scoot” he bolted outside with his treasure.\n“It’s his special treat Dogs love cheese, But Cheese doesn’t love dogs, too much will kill them,” I said quietly.\n“Why Charlie?” she asked out of the blue.\n“why Veronica?” I asked back.\nShe laughed, “you’re such a dick,” she smiled shoveling pasta into her mouth.\n“You’re the Expert on my dick dear one,” I countered as she nearly choked on her pasta while laughing.\n“The people who owned the bitch were called Chaplain, Boy Dog, and Charlie Chaplain,” I replied shoveling pasta as well.\n“That’s funny” she smiled “I thought so,” I said.\n“He looks like a Charlie,” she said as she attacked the rest of my pasta on my plate.\n“The relationship has gone to that level hey, stealing food from old people,” I said as I started to tickle her.\n“You’re not old,” she smiled as I stopped the assault. “Yet” she said as she grabbed the last portion of my plate and stuffed into her mouth.\nI grabbed her by the waist and lifted her down onto the big fluffy rug in the dining area her robe had opened exposing her breasts and pussy.\nI launched a full frontal assault on her defenseless assets sucking biting nibbling; she then grabbed my hard prick and was in the process of trying to separate it from my body through force.\nAs we rolled around on the rug my trusty hound mounted a rear end attack, he started furiously licking her exposed clit and labia.\nShe landed on my chest in shock, squealing in surprise.\n“You OK?” I asked as her eyes started to glaze over. “You want me to get him away?” I asked.\n“Yes. No. Oh god that feels so good,” she swooned into my chest.\n“Lauren seems to like it,” I said.\n“Lauren OMG,” she squeaked as Charlie kept up the rear attack.\n“Lauren really how, why?” she said as she started to cum from Charlies Tongue.\nShe moaned biting my chest and nipple.\n“Boyfriend dramas. He broke her heart and took her cherry and dumped her.”\nVeronica stopped biting as Charlie stopped licking she saw his 5’’ prick exposed with his 4’’ knot and whimpered at the sight.\n“Did Lauren you know, do it all,” she whispered.\n“Yep the full Monty” I said quietly into her ear.\n“But what will you think of me if I do that?” she said little girl voiced.\n“Nothing you can do, and nothing you will ever do, will ever stop me loving you as much as I love you now,” I said kissing her lips and face.\n“Roll Over on your back Knees up legs open,” I said as I supported her on my chest.\n“Here Boy make my girl happy, Big Dog.”\nHe bounded up onto her chest his prick hard pressed against her mound. As he entered her with one, swift fucking thrust of his back legs.\nShe arched her back and raised her arse as he hammered like a machine gun in and out of her of her tight teen cunt.\nShe spasmed, as series of orgasms engulfed her body, her fingers digging into my thighs as his knot finally entered her tunnel and he pumped gallons of watery doggy cum deep into her teen cunt.\nI could feel tears on my arms as he finally stopped pumping and pulled out with a loud Popping sound. The watery doggy cum flowed out. As he started to clean up his own cum with his tongue, another series of smaller orgasms engulfed Veronica’s body.\n“Enough, enough,” she gasped, as she panted trying to catch her breath lying on her back.\nI took Charlie back to his room and locked the gate.\nShe was lying on her back arms and hands on her face trying to stop the flood of tears.\nI knelt down between her open thighs moving her arms and hands from her face as I kissed her closed eyes licking away her tears.\nShe opened them and said, “I love you and hate you at the same time.”\n“That’s OK,” I replied they just one side each of the same coin. “I will show you how much I love you, OK?” I opened her thighs right up and attacked her still dripping doggy cum filled cunt with equal ferocity.\nI nibbled and chewed her flaps, I bit her clit, and I fucked her with my tongue.\nI dredged every bit of doggy juice I could find. She orgasm ed, with a Blood curdling yell as I stuffed my full length of my prick up her cunt right up to, and into the neck of her teen womb.\nMy hands grasped her shoulders as I fucked her hard into the timber floor, unloaded thick rivers of cum into her freshly fucked cunt.\nShe passed out as I pumped my final load into her. I held her close as I rolled over on my side cradling her body into mine.\nHer eyes fluttered open, as she looked at me with amazement on her face.\n“You still love me?” I asked as I kissed her forehead.\n“More than you can ever know,” she smiled.\nI kissed her on the lips transferring a bit of Doggy cum into her mouth, her eyes opened wide at the new watery taste.\n“Charlie?” she asked.\n“Yep” my furry Boy.\n“Weird taste,” she said as I could see her trying to work it out.\n“Almonds,” I said as that registered in her brain.\n“Yea watery, doggy cum covered almonds” she squeaked whilst rolling on the rug with laughter.\n“Would you like some on your ham?” I asked as I got up to go to the fridge to get us a drink and a post coital snack.\n“Dog Biscuits per chance,” I said sotto voice; this sent her into a coughing bout of hysterical laughter.\nAs she rolled on her side, her pink rosebud appeared to flutter open.\nI promptly stuck the end of my tongue into her virginal arse and proceeded to fuck it for all it was worth. The resulting scream was worth the price of admission. I probed, licked, sucked and put more than 30 years of acquired skill into that anal assault.\nI pinched her clit between my fingers, which resulted in further access to the buttery passage of her anal canal.\nShe squirmed to escape my assault but to no avail. There was In addition, a massive amount of Juice leaking from her cunt onto my hand.\nI promptly used that to further coat her anal opening allowing even more of my tongue to enter her rectum.\nBy this stage, her cunt and thighs were awash with her cum, not to mention the rug as well. Me I just kept tonguing away.\nVeronica started begging and pleading for me to cease my anal attack.\n“Sorry my darling I got carried away,” I said as I kissed her forehead.\n“They will have to carry me away if you keep that up,” she said collapsing like a wet dishcloth, onto the rug straight into a pool of Charlies and my Cum.\nShe placed her hand on her back. “Bugger, I don’t really care,” she said.\n“You don’t really care if I bugger you, oh goody, how exciting. Roll over, brace position, get ready to repel boarders,” I said in my best Plummy English accent.\n“Stop it your killing me,” Veronica moaned as she lay on her back laughing.\n“Dead People Sex as well, fantastic and it’s not even my birthday!” I exclaimed excitedly.\nI lifted her into a sitting position, walked back into the kitchen and gave her a bottle of Gatorade to drink.\n“Here this should help,” I said as I wiped her face and neck with a damp tea towel. She finished her drink as I continued to wipe her breasts and pussy.\nI sniffed and licked the tea towel as I finished wiping her pussy.\n“Gross,” she said laughing, “You are just so bad.”\n“You’re not wrong there,” said Lauren, standing at the kitchen bench looking down on us smiling.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><h5 id="veronica-the-beginning">Veronica: The Beginning<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#veronica-the-beginning">#</a></h5>
<p>I was leaning on the doorjamb of the shop, looking down the street enjoying the mid morning sunshine, when Louise, my Manager said &ldquo;penny for your thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled &amp; said &ldquo;Veronica not Penny&rdquo;. This then earned me a hit with an empty shoebox.</p>
<p>Saying &ldquo;Max Adams you are such a lazy bugger,&rdquo; as she walked towards the counter, to finish serving one of my favourite customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw that Mary&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;no respect at all from staff these days what is the world coming to&rdquo; which provoked even more laughter &amp; derision from the other customers, in the store. &ldquo;Do you girls want a coffee my treat,&rdquo; which then sent even more laughter echoing down the street.</p>
<p>As I marched out, tail between my legs to get the coffees I could not help thinking how much my life had changed in the two years since the death of my wife Elizabeth.</p>
<p>She had had breast cancer that she had then met head on, and beaten, with Chemo &amp; a healthy lifestyle. However, she had changed and not for the better.</p>
<p>She had become more cynical and introverted. Which then caused the existing earlier problems in our marriage to resurface? I with 2 children from a previous relationship, and her inability to carry a baby to term had added to the stress.</p>
<p>Her family did not help either, interfering &amp; generally being a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Especially her older brother Barry, as I found out later she had been on the phone too. Which had caused the head on collision that had ended her life?</p>
<p>She was due to sign an updated will, and was in the process of applying for a divorce. Which came as a great shock to me, when told of that fact, after her funeral?</p>
<p>Her family had also applied to have her new unsigned will ratified, which I had fought &amp; won in court , I then promptly told them all to fuck off &amp; have a nice life, and to feel free not to contact me ever again.</p>
<p>My Mother&rsquo;s family owned Beach side commercial property, and farming properties, which in the 12 years of our marriage had greatly increased in value.</p>
<p>I also had worked before my marriage, in the Mining industry as an Electrician earning a six-figure income. I had joined with other family members, to turn 80 Acres of the swamp. Into a hugely successful, Canal estate.</p>
<p>Which had made in excess of $120 million for the family trust? Which, unbeknown to my wife I had a 25% share in. I still do not know why I did not tell her, we were very comfortable as it was. Beach side house, great cars, and no debts.</p>
<p>Her family had been leeching off her for years, holidays, cars you name it.</p>
<p>As I had had this property before our marriage, I did not feel it necessary to tell her. Her constant whining about how successful my family was. Not telling her was satisfying.</p>
<p>I also had a 50% share in a Mining lease, with my cousin Matt in the middle of nowhere, The Money Pit within the family, which had chewed up nearly $4 million dollars, over the years to keep it current. The use it or lose it clause.</p>
<p>In the previous 2 years, I had torn down the old store and built a 10-storey beach apartment complex including a 300 sq meter High-end shoe &amp; clothing store, complete with hairdresser and coffee shop. Designed to, separate money from women, or their husband&rsquo;s. It was going gangbusters.</p>
<p>Ah well I thought It is a Nice day and life is good. Little did I know it was to change totally for the better?</p>
<p>I had seen her wandering in the early mornings before school, looking in shop windows, at dresses and clothing in general.</p>
<p>She was gawky, with big hands and feet, 5&rsquo; 7 inches or so, nearly a full head taller than most boys her age were. I found out later she was 15  years old. With the then older style, school uniform, old shoes.</p>
<p>However, she had an inner beauty. Graceful, like a giraffe is beautiful.</p>
<p>Curly highlighted Blonde hair, those blue-sea green eyes. Long legs and B size boobs. (Think of Ella from Fame Girls) you get the picture.</p>
<p>Me I am 43 years old 6&rsquo; 2 about 90 kg (200 lbs) I look after myself swimming and riding my bike. I have to I like my food too much.</p>
<p>I had gone to pick up my paper and the new import fashion magazines that morning when I saw her put one in her backpack. She saw me looking at her; I put out my hand for it back. As I put it on the shelf, I said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not the best one to get, the new Marie Clair is better, if its fashion you&rsquo;re after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; and started to tear up. &ldquo;They are all so expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it, besides your on camera&rdquo; I replied. Looking over her shoulder and pointing at said camera!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica Masters,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Adams, Nice to meet you Miss Masters&rdquo; I said smiling, and giving her a gentle hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry you&rsquo;re not in trouble, you would have been if you had taken it outside,&rdquo; I said as we walked to pay for the magazines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put in on my account please Billy, Miss Veronica reckons you&rsquo;re too damn expensive,&rdquo; I said laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be any trouble in the future will you?&rdquo; I asked looking at her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; she said looking back at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Girl&rdquo; I said laughing, &ldquo;you can buy me a coffee, you can afford that, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just&rdquo; she replied smiling as we walked out to the store onto the street towards the nearest coffee shop.</p>
<p>We found a table in the morning sun out of the breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you like Miss Veronica, Cappuccino, Mocha, have you had breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mocha please, No I&rsquo;m good for breakfast,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you would be right tasty for breakfast I replied, &ldquo;Not thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; I said as she blushed and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brain in gear Ass in neutral Max, sorry Veronica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had Breakfast?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Not why Not, what do you want because I&rsquo;m starving and I won&rsquo;t eat alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bacon and egg roll please,&rdquo; she said looking in her purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full breakfast for me please Marie, a Cappuccino &amp; Mocha plus one of your fabulous bacon &amp; egg rolls, for my lovely young guest&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put that away, it will be a cold day in hell before I allow a pretty girl to pay for her own breakfast,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Pretty, big feet, big hands&rdquo; looking downcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me Veronica, how old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be 16&rdquo; in October she said before I could finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, you&rsquo;re still growing you Muppet&rdquo;, using my favourite expression &ldquo;your gawky ungainly, tripping over your own feet I suppose?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; she replied with an amazed look on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doh been there, been that,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;One rock in a paddock &amp; I would fall over it,&rdquo; I said smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful, like a giraffe is beautiful; neck isn&rsquo;t as long, but who&rsquo;s looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so,&rdquo; she said beaming back with a 1000-watt smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God Kiddo if I was 20 years younger your dad would be chasing me down the street with a shotgun, filled with bird shot&rdquo; She started to tear up at that statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up sweetheart, did I say something wrong,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who my Dad was, my mum won&rsquo;t tell me&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know or she won&rsquo;t tell?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; she replied going quite.</p>
<p>I started laughing quietly to myself, which caused a raised head to stare at me in surprise at the laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same with me my darling girl&rdquo; as placing my hand on hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Mum went to a US Embassy party with Friends of her over 40 years ago, and came away with a Present, Me, her and just turned, Eighteen, he was married, on assignment, Alcohol was involved , I didn&rsquo;t find out who he was Till I was in my Mid 30s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was moved from pillar to post with relatives till I was 4, then my Mums Older Brother &amp; His wife took me to live with them till I was over 16.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mum had Gotten Married to an English Property owner whose wife had died and I was surplus to requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love my Mum; don&rsquo;t like her much, I really loved My Aunty Nancy &amp; Uncle Pete who looked after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At 16 I started to butt heads, knew it all knew nothing, Went bush as an Apprentice electrician with a Mining company, got a girl pregnant at 17, went away came back, got her pregnant again. Stayed away made a shit load of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came up here to help out my other Uncle &amp; Aunt, Got Married, made a shitload More Money, Wife died, talking to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she stared at me like a rabbit in a spotlight, mouth agape!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry you were saying?&rdquo; as breakfast arrived.</p>
<p>Marie our waiter just stood &amp; stared at us both.</p>
<p>Me I could not believe I had said so much to someone I had only just met.</p>
<p>I then looked at them both with a firm stare and said, &ldquo;That info is not to be repeated around town, you feel me,&rdquo; using another of my favourite expressions from the TV series The Wire.</p>
<p>They both nodded in affirmation, Marie just stood still staring at the Veronica whose head framed by the early morning sunshine. Looking like a Botticelli painting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good she is so beautiful,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just noticed.&rdquo; I stood up, to race inside, to get my camera from my backpack, to take the photo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay there sit still don&rsquo;t move a muscle, be back in a second,&rdquo; I said as I dashed off to get my backpack.</p>
<p>Camera out, focus, shot in frame echoed in my head, bang, bang, bang, as I fired off 3 quick shots to complete the photo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go girls have a look at that&rdquo; passing over the camera for them to see the result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh My God &ldquo;was the reaction as they viewed the results in the camera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not me&rdquo; Veronica exclaimed looking at the screen, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t look like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes you do&rdquo; I replied smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, you were beautiful, Missy Moo, you just don&rsquo;t know it, which makes you even more beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my nose is too big, and my teeth are funny, and my eyes are well, a little bit crooked&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep to all of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those imperfections that make us what we are,&rdquo; I said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sought of like the Mole on Cindy Crawford&rsquo;s face&rdquo; which then got me blank stares from them both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God Youth, it&rsquo;s wasted on the Young, One of the first supermodels early 80, s &amp; 90, s, world fame, and fortune&rdquo; shaking my head in disgust at their lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat your Roll it&rsquo;s going to go cold, and you Marie, sit here for a second. I have something for you&rdquo; smiling as I placed my arm round her waist.</p>
<p>She sat on the chair next to me as I gave her an envelope I had taken from my backpack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy belated Birthday Kiddo sorry I missed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been away Overseas in Europe, buying stock for the next season and had missed her 21st.</p>
<p>The scream that followed the opening of the envelope, echoed round the courtyard, and resulted in heads turning in all directions to see what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Max, God I love you, it&rsquo;s too much&rdquo; She cried jumping and shrieking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of women say that to me&rdquo; which resulted in an outburst of laughter from the assembled diners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A round the world ticket, Business class, O M G.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure that&rsquo;s all there is in the envelope?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She turned it up, and a Black Visa card fell onto the table, she picked it up.</p>
<p>Her name was on the card, Marie Anne Jennings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s 35K on there for your expenses and tuition at the International Food College in Milan, The next course is due to start in September. So you and Toby can have a bit of a holiday before he starts at Fiat with his Master Mechanics Course for Ferrari.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maronello is just down the Autostrada from there, I have organized a 2 bedroom apartment for your stay through my contacts in Milan, Mates rates so it&rsquo;s all good. The amount I&rsquo;ve spent buying there, I thought it was the least they could do for me&rdquo; I said tearing up. She hugged me tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Thank you, Thank you&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem, don&rsquo;t worry I took it out from your tips I didn&rsquo;t pay you, cause your family Kiddo, OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which, as a fitting reward for my previous good deeds? Earned me punch on the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch, kiss it better&rdquo; I replied. I then planted a big wet sloppy kiss on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go On Bugger off and get our coffees they had better not be cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veronica just stared open mouthed at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close your gob and eat your roll Missy Moo, you&rsquo;ll catch flies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uh Oh here comes trouble&rdquo; looking in the direction of the Bistros doorway.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s step mother Stephanie arrived at our table followed closely behind by her husband Brian and their two girls. Lauren aged 16  and Holly aged 12.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lost your mind?&rdquo; said Stephanie &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much Max.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie didn&rsquo;t think so&rdquo; as I lifted Holly onto my lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Gorgeous how&rsquo;s my favourite 12 year old Jennings&rdquo; as she snuggled into my shoulder.</p>
<p>Stephanie then saw Veronica sitting opposite &ldquo;Oh, sorry I didn&rsquo;t know you had company&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica, Stephanie, Stephanie, Veronica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They smiled at each other and shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica&rdquo;, Brian he&rsquo;s the tall Curly haired Gent and the one on my lap is Holly,&rdquo; I said introducing them. Brian&rsquo;s shaved head glowed in the sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And last but not least, Lauren&rdquo; I said turning to Lauren who stood glaring daggers at Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo; Veronica squeaked as she saw the look on Laurens face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s hanging out of your ass Miss?&rdquo; I asked Lauren as her Mother finally saw her expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to Know&rdquo; she snarled.</p>
<p>I quietly placed Holly on the ground and grabbing Lauren gently, by her arm, looked directly into her eyes and said, &ldquo;Care to run that by me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you Like to Know,&rdquo; came the snarling reply.</p>
<p>With one fluid movement, I placed her over my lap, her uniform skirt up her back, her white panty clad backside in the breeze, and I pulled her knickers down, and delivered four hard stinging slaps to her bottom.</p>
<p>As the sound of the slaps faded away into the background, you could have heard a pin drop. Both her parents stood stock-still open mouthed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again how are we?&rdquo; I asked as I pulled her panties up over her bottom and stood her up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; she tearfully replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you, but I don&rsquo;t take that sought of crap from anyone OK,&rdquo; I said kissing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apologize to Veronica, and your Mum and Dad,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry Mummy, Daddy, Sorry Veronica,&rdquo; she said giving each one a hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here Kiddo,&rdquo; as I enveloped her in a great big bear Hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still my Favourite Big Jennings Girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK sweetheart, still love me?&rdquo; I asked smiling, at her tear stained face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all good Uncle Max&rdquo; smiling and hugging me back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK folks the shows over, nothing to see, move along&rdquo; I said jokingly to the crowd.</p>
<p>I handed her my car keys and said while looking at her parents who at this time had regained their composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring my car out of the car park and run it up to the apron before the footpath, OK, not on the footpath just before&rdquo; She looked at her parents as her mum nodded her head in affirmation.</p>
<p>She squealed and Jumped into my arms again squealing &ldquo;thank you, thank you, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treat them mean, to keep them keen!&rdquo; I exclaimed once again getting a laugh from the other diners.</p>
<p>She grabbed her bag ready to tear off &ldquo;Sweetie,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might need to adjust your bum&rdquo; her skirt was caught in her bag and her cute derriere was exposed to the delight of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit&rdquo; she exclaimed as she hastily rearranged her skirt and panties as she went to wash her face and tidy up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop you off at school as well Veronica, if you want me to?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be great&rdquo; she replied smiling and shaking her head in amazement at what had just occurred.</p>
<p>Lauren reappeared at the doorway looking unaffected, wearing a smile a mile wide on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Miss, toilet now&rdquo; I said looking directly at Veronica &ldquo;scoot, go, you don&rsquo;t want to be late, Passenger side front seat as well, OK&rdquo; as I sat back down to finish my now growing colder breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Uncle Max&rdquo; was the cheeky reply.</p>
<p>I smiled as I shook my head at this morning&rsquo;s turn of events.</p>
<p>Looking at both Laurens parents, who had at that moment, just sat down with a coffee.</p>
<p>I replaced Holly in my lap to finish my breakfast and coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can stay here with me Missy, I don&rsquo;t want any distractions, or you getting run over OK,&rdquo; I said hugging her.</p>
<p>Stephanie looked over and smiled as she said, &ldquo;Lauren has been just such a shit lately I really could sell her into slavery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have enough money for them to take her&rdquo; I replied getting another laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you Miss Holly Go Lightly will not tattle about what&rsquo;s been said here, OK?&rdquo; I said looking at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or over my lap you&rsquo;ll go as well&rdquo; hugging her gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mu-mm&rdquo; she replied as she stuffed a piece of bacon into her mouth which she had stolen off my plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go On, get cleaned up, toilet as well, Missy&rdquo; I said as I planted a big bacon Kiss on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the story with Veronica?&rdquo; Stephanie asked quietly aware of all the listening ears around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I really don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing or where, or, if anywhere it&rsquo;s going. But there is just something magical about her&rdquo; I said as I showed them the photos I had taken earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens would you look at that, she looks like an angel&rdquo; Stephanie replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wowser&rdquo; was all Brian could mutter, &ldquo;How old is she?&rdquo; He said under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;15  going on 30 Like most girls, as you both well know, having one of your own&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>I then said something that had just entered my subconscious &ldquo;I think she might be the One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both sets of eyebrows rose up in shock. &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; both said in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea really, Ah I must away, Time to get these Kidletts off to get some of that there book learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come only Curly Girl get those little legs Moving,&rdquo; I said as Holly came bounding out the Door.</p>
<p>I could hear my Range Rover is coming up the ramp from the Underground parking space of the apartment block. On the opposite side of the road, further down from the Bistro.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lauren &amp; Veronica where bonding in that Mysterious way that women or girls in this case Do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I was such a bitch said Lauren It&rsquo;s been a Rough couple of weeks, Exams, and my parents are making me save up for my own car. It will take forever I will be 60 before I can afford one,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you will get cheap insurance and senior discount on parking,&rdquo; Veronica answered back.</p>
<p>Lauren just missed a pillar whist backing out of the parking bay from laughing that hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it you Bitch or I will have an accident,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had an accident when he was smacking you on the arse, your face got all dreamy looking like you were getting off on it,&rdquo; Veronica said.</p>
<p>Lauren Braked hard in shock, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t show did it, she said quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did, but only if you knew what to look for,&rdquo; Veronica said Staring at Lauren intently. &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; she asked Lauren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t Know about Max Adams, what cave have you been living in?&rdquo; she said with amazement in her Voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cave in Melbourne, I have only just moved here in the past 5 weeks,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry My Bad,&rdquo; said Lauren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Really Rich, Smoking hot, funny as all buggery, Kind, generous and I love him to bits,&rdquo; she said smiling back at Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s also got a really big Willy&rdquo; she added Moving her hands about 8&rsquo; apart, as a look of abject misery appeared on Veronica s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was all Veronica could get out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you really love him, heaps then,&rdquo; Veronica added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep sure do Heaps and heaps?&rdquo; she said with a smug look on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s My Father,&rdquo; said Lauren smirking outrageously. A split second after Veronica registered that statement she launched herself at Lauren Tickling and hitting her whilst she negotiated the ramp up to the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it, or I&rsquo;ll crash the car you stupid cow,&rdquo; she said while screaming with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s your father, I thought Brian was your father,&rdquo; she said as Lauren finally brought the Range Rover to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Brian&rsquo;s my dad, Max is my father Holly&rsquo;s as well.&rdquo; She replied as they watched me walk up the street towards where they we had parked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brian married my mum 20 years ago he had 2 Kids Daniel, &amp; Marie mum lost one Baby, then Brian got Testicular Cancer and had to have both his testacies removed&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They asked Max if he would help them have a couple of Kids He said yes and turned up with a piece of 4 x 2 timber. Apparently, they all cracked up in laughter as my Dad Brian is like a horse 12&rsquo;&rsquo; and Max said he didn&rsquo;t want to fall into Mums pussy, I came along and 4 years later Holly arrived. I heard them talking about having a couple more babies Max said do I have To I&rsquo;m still trying to recover from the last time we tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He really loves My Mum and Brian they have been best friends forever,&rdquo; she said as she opened the door to go round to get into the back seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the Bum Chum?&rdquo; I said as I walked up to open the Door for Holly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you haven&rsquo;t been telling too many stories about me to Miss Veronica&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, It&rsquo;s all good Uncle Max we&rsquo;ve been talking about fashion,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well then&rdquo; I said as I climbed into the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>At that moment, Louise my Manager appeared out from the side passage with some bags for the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello what do we have here&rdquo; she said looking at Veronica perched up in the front seat with the two girls in the back, an amused expression on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m collecting orphan and abandoned children for sale into servitude and a life of abject misery,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good I have 2 more you can collect at the Bus Stop,&rdquo; she said laughing as she stepped around to the Driver&rsquo;s side door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise meet Veronica Masters, Veronica meet Louise Conner, my manager and my Number one go to girl&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely to meet you, they both chorused!&rdquo; With resulted in, laughter from all of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you in about 20 or so better make that 40. I&rsquo;ll pick up Charlie I&rsquo;ve Missed Him,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be cleaning up after him if he makes a mess or pees all over the stock,&rdquo; she said kissing me on the cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, some of us have to work for a living&rdquo; she said as she walked away to the rear entrance of the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie is my dog Veronica in case you&rsquo;re wondering he&rsquo;s a lot better behaved than some in this car who I won&rsquo;t mention,&rdquo; I said looking in the rear view mirror as two tongues appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK kids let&rsquo;s, rock and roll,&rdquo; I said as I turned Usher up on the stereo Music flooded the car as we entered the street.</p>
<p>Veronica s Face registered amazement as I turned into a One Way Street with a No Entry sign, stating Council and Police exempted, as two police officers exited their car at the local Police Beat adjacent to the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well if it isn&rsquo;t Constable Plod &amp; his trusty sidekick Big Ears,&rdquo; I said out the window as I pulled up to a halt.</p>
<p>They turned and laughed as they both walked to the car. &ldquo;Hi girls, Hi Smarty what&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>The girls both said Hi Uncle Dave, Hi Sergeant Carter as they walked to the Drivers window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave Sutton, Sergeant Ben Carter, and Miss Veronica Masters&rdquo; I said introducing them to Veronica in the passenger&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah our little Fashion Magazine Bandit&rdquo; said Ben &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to become a habit I hope Veronica,&rdquo; he said looking over his glasses at her blushing face opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir &ldquo;she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Girl, I thought that might be the case,&rdquo; he said walking back towards the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be all Day Dave&rdquo; he said looking back at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will talk to you at lunchtime Smarty,&rdquo; said Dave.</p>
<p>As he walked past the Car, he saw the Council sticker on the window &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a bloody burglar he laughed as he walked towards the police beat office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that all about Uncle Max?&rdquo; Lauren asked from the back.</p>
<p>I turned towards Veronica to see if she would answer the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to lift a Fashion Magazine and your Uncle stopped me from doing something really stupid,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well that was lucky,&rdquo; was the response.</p>
<p>I had pulled up before a Mob of school Kids I pipped the horn and 50 heads looked up. I saw Louise&rsquo;s two boys Mike 17 and Timmy 14.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello Little Boys would you like a ride to school,&rdquo; I said in my best creepy voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes please was the reply with laughter from the rest of them.</p>
<p>I have room for two I said to the assembled Mob What about you Inky, I said to a tall buxom 17-year-old Goddess.</p>
<p>OK Uncle Max Count me in.</p>
<p>As she walked to the back Timmy and Holly Clambered through to the back row of seats.</p>
<p>OK wait for the bus then, lets go I said setting off just as the bus pulled into the Bus Zone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Stan,&rdquo; I said to the bus driver. &ldquo;How is it going old Buddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good He Replied, You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great mate it&rsquo;s a good day to be alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked at the gaggle of kids boarding the Bus You Lot Behave OK I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problems Mr Adams, glad to hear it&rdquo;. I replied to no one in particular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will drop you lot of first, then Veronica last OK Gang&rdquo;, I said over Pit bull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry Inga, Veronica, Inga Veronica&hellip;My bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi was the shy smiles all round, Hey Inky get your dad to give me a bell, don&rsquo;t worry I will see him this morning is he in the office or at home&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s in the office today he got a meeting with a group of interstate investors looking to buy farmland on the river she said.</p>
<p>Which I nodded too, we continued the 10 minute drive to their school and as I drove up into the gates of the Hastings Christian Grammar School.</p>
<p>Veronica looked at the new buildings and oval, in stunned silence, as a raft of foreign cars were disgorging children of all sizes and colours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lot have a great day see you all this arvo&rdquo; I said as I kissed them all goodbye Not Mike though at 17 he was too cool for school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Miss Veronica back to the real world&rdquo; I said as a group of heads turned and watched us depart out the gate, back onto the main road towards the local state school.</p>
<p>As I approached the school precinct I pulled off into a council storage area, I looked over at Veronica; she had a funny look on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all good Veronica I just want to have a quiet talk with not too many prying ears and Eyes Ok,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>OK, she said smiling back.</p>
<p>I pulled up in the shade put the car in park and looked at her &ldquo;what did you and Lauren talk about,&rdquo; I asked gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rdquo; she replied quietly.</p>
<p>Ah, I said, &ldquo;I thought that might be the case, what did she say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said that you were her, and Holly&rsquo;s dad and that she loved you, and you were really nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all you sure Not about money or how I&rsquo;m so fantastic in bed Dam I will have to get a new publicist.</p>
<p>I said Laughing. &ldquo;Did she talk about money?&rdquo; I asked gently prodding for an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that you had lots, and you were really generous &quot; she said hanging her head; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not going to get into trouble is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I replied its good, now about you Miss, you don&rsquo;t have to answer these next questions, but if you do that would make me happy OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Pressure&rdquo; I said as I gently lifted her face to look into mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have a boyfriend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want one?&rdquo; I said looking back into her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, you want me for your girlfriend, why I&rsquo;m just a Kid!&rdquo; She exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re a young lady with tremendous potential, and I believe we could have a fantastic time together. I replied smiling at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean sex and all,&rdquo; she said smiling back at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, but If you want to wait till your old enough, that&rsquo;s OK as well, I won&rsquo;t do anything to harm or hurt you OK&rdquo; I said taking her hand in mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this goes the way I think it&rsquo;s going, I&rsquo;m talking Marriage babies the whole ball of wax Veronica?&rdquo; I said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married, Me, Why? You could have any girl you want; I saw how they all looked at you at breakfast,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that&rsquo;s why I want you, it&rsquo;s sought of like your photo, and you think you&rsquo;re not beautiful but you are, and all you have to do for me, is Love me,&rdquo; I said as my eyes started to tear up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got money, success friends &amp; family that I love dearly but I want More Kids, Lots of them,&rdquo; I said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many she asked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;10 or 12,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;10 or 12?&rdquo; she said her eyes as big as a dinner plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to have all of them, we&rsquo;d share that around? I said as I looked at the dashboard clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we traveling for time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK. I have a study period at 9.15&rdquo; she said,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s only 8.45 now&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laurens Mum wants a couple more, I&rsquo;d like to have a couple with Louise, and I would have to find a couple more. Unless of course you want to have 6 or 7&rdquo;, I said laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;What a rush,&rdquo; as I grabbed a cold Coke out of the console fridge unit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diet, Normal or Zero,&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Zero&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t even kissed, and here we are discussing having 6 babies, that&rsquo;s just so bizarre,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>I reached over and placed my hand on her face, drawing her towards me, and kissed her gently full on the lips, tasting coke in the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she said as I pulled away her eyes big and sparkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea wow back at you,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we do that again?&rdquo; She said starting to breathe harder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For about the next 40 years,&rdquo; I replied, looking into her face.</p>
<p>She Looked at me in shock. &ldquo;You really mean it don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yep, I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be Veronica Adams, people will be saying, you know I went to school with her?&rdquo; I said jokingly she just smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God what a rush!&rdquo; She said as she took another mouth full of drink.</p>
<p>She turned and looked at me. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be married then, not just living together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, when you turn 18, you will be Mrs Max Adams if that is what you want,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These other girls who are they, friends, old lovers, or what?&rdquo; she asked looking intently at my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I haven&rsquo;t really thought it out that far&rdquo; I replied, amazed at the depth of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I get a choice, or a say in which they were?&rdquo; She asked tucking her legs up under her Bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I would want to be able to get along with them, I don&rsquo;t want any dramas with people who would cause us trouble,&rdquo; she said, taking another mouthful of Zero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had enough of that,&rdquo; she said after swallowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I both&rdquo; I replied. We really should be going it&rsquo;s after 9 already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked directly at my face, and moved forward and kissed me hard on the lips, it was ragged, but fantastic all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really need to be back in class till 1.45, can we go somewhere private, so we can finish this conversation,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>My heart just about went out through my chest, along with a big rush of blood to my ever-hardening prick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you back to my house if that&rsquo;s OK, it&rsquo;s about 15 mins from here, up the coast road,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>I eased the car into the traffic, and heading up the beach road to Hastings Park towards where my house was. Veronica&rsquo;s eyes bugged out of her head as she saw the size of it. As I pulled up to the gated entrance, three stories high white, with a blue tile roof, Beautiful gardens and all.</p>
<p>I eased the car into the sunken garage alongside my old SL Mercedes Coupe and Bike; she opened the door and followed me up the flight of stairs into the main living area overlooking the pool and the back garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My god this is so pretty!&rdquo; She gasped as she walked towards the back veranda &amp; the pool area. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s freaking massive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad, hey you like I like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots,&rdquo; was her reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on I&rsquo;ll give you the 2 dollar tour, lounge dining, huge galley kitchen, overlooking the sunken living area, the ceilings where 10ft high which added to the open feel of the house.</p>
<p>We climbed upstairs into the third storey, guest side 5 beds 3 baths and across the walkway towards the master bed and en suite bathroom with an office area leading off to the side.</p>
<p>The master bedroom ran the whole of one side of the 3rd floor with verandas front and back overlooking the pool you could see the ocean from the back and from the front the hills, the upstairs was designed in an H pattern master bed on one side guests the other, with the connecting walkway joining both. From the walkway, you overlooked the front entry and the living area to the back.</p>
<p>I had turned from opening the doors to let in the breeze and fresh air, Veronica was taking off her Dress and kicking off her shoes. Shocked, that didn&rsquo;t even cover one tenth of my emotions.</p>
<p>Blood rushed from my chest, to my prick, it sprang from  hard from the kiss in the car, to bullet proof in no time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; I asked as she took off her socks, I saw tears in her eyes as I walked towards her drinking in her face she B size boobs with her nipples sticking up like erasers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My god you are just so beautiful,&rdquo; I gasped as I kissed her eyes, her lips, her cheeks tasting her tears, bacon and Girl taste as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will probably go to hell for this,&rdquo; I said as I undid her Bra, Her boobs pooped into view Grapefruit size, beautiful full nipples standing firm and proud.</p>
<p>She unzipped my shirt as I undid the drawstring on my pants; she lowered them over my buttocks, as my fully erect penis popped out of my underpants.</p>
<p>The head a purple colour, glistening with pre cum, as she gently rubbed the end of with a wet finger, which she then put back in her mouth covered with juice.</p>
<p>I kissed her neck and nibbled on her right nipple holding it and rolling it with my tongue. She was trying to get my underpants off with not a lot of success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need a hand,&rdquo; I asked letting go of her nipple from my teeth.</p>
<p>She shivered a Yes as I pulled them down and my prick and balls sprang free from their confining prison. She had started to pull her own panties off, only to have one side down so it was like a slow reveal of her pussy and mound.</p>
<p>I finally dropped mine as she dropped hers, we both gasped at what we saw before us.</p>
<p>Her mound covered by a thin carpet of dark blond hair fanning out from her vulva, her lips sticking out like petals on a just opened rose, and her clit the size of a peanut swollen an enlarged its head making its way out from its hood.</p>
<p>She saw the look on my face and tears started flowing down her cheeks. Her hands went to cover her pussy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ugly,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; I gasped, &ldquo;I will have him shot, it is the most beautiful pussy I have ever seen. It&rsquo;s perfect, just like you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not just saying that,&rdquo; she said quietly placing her head on my chest. I just picked her up and carried her to my King size bed placing her in the middle I covered her face with kisses, tasting the trail of her tears.</p>
<p>I marveled at the arch of her neck, graceful. I stroked and kissed it along the hairline.</p>
<p>When I finally finished kissing her neck, I had reached her breasts. Sucking each erect nipple in turn, savouring the taste, texture.</p>
<p>Her breathing got deeper, heavier in its volume as I continued down her body.</p>
<p>I listened to her ragged breathing. I started kissing her belly, button, nibbling, sucking, and biting tasting the sweat that had formed at the top of her pubic bone. I could see her pussy slick with her juices, the smell was almost overpowering.</p>
<p>I had finally reached the Promised Land. The first lick of her vulva caused her back to arch, and a high pitch squeal, the second, third and subsequent licks got an ever-great response. She was keening with a high-pitched hum her hips thrusting into my face and tongue.</p>
<p>When my tongue parted her labia and caressed her clit, she went ballistic. Sought of like the warning on a firework rocket, &ldquo;light blue touch paper and retire&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What I got was head clamped to pussy suck hard, cum heaps.</p>
<p>Her pussy exploded in a rush of juices it was coming from every pore in her vagina her lips just kept unfolding, her clit was red and engorged like nothing I had seen before.</p>
<p>The taste of her was, like the clearest sweetest nectar you could ever imagine. The more I sucked the more I got, the more I got the more I sucked.</p>
<p>Veronica bathed in sweat, keening at an incredible level and generally having a hell of a time. If you will, excuse the pun.</p>
<p>I was in Awe.</p>
<p>I stopped and looked at her, my face awash with her fluids and asked if she was OK?</p>
<p>She just reached down, pulled me to her face, and kissed me hard on the lips mashing her face, lips, and tongue together with mine. My poor prick by this time had gone that purple blue shade you get with a bruise. It ached. Pre cum was flowing like a tap from the slit It looked ready to explode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God that was the most wonderful feeling I have ever had she said what did you do to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me I said, &ldquo;I just hung on an enjoyed the ride&rdquo; which earned me a punch and laughter. Wow was what I got in return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ready for the main meal miss&rdquo; I said while kissing her gently on the neck.</p>
<p>Mu mm was her reply &ldquo;let me put it in&rdquo; said Veronica finally getting a closer look at my engorged prick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God it&rsquo;s big&rdquo; she said grasping it with her right hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so thick as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only one I&rsquo;ve got here at the moment,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;so it will have to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She placed the head at the entrance to her opening, her labia wrapping around it like a present, as I pushed down she pushed up, and it entered her canal an inch at a time her juices causing it to glide smoothly along the tight confines of her teenage pussy.</p>
<p>I had about 3 inches in when she gave a slight jump &ldquo;you OK my darling&rdquo;, I asked uh huh she said that&rsquo;s as far as anyone has been. What no dildos, fruit or other people. No, she replied smiling it&rsquo;s all you from now on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica Marshal the undiscovered pussy I exclaimed, &ldquo;Causing even more laughter and another 2 inches to disappear into the sweet wet confines of her body. I backed out two and fed in another four.</p>
<p>It was just about all my poor prick could take. I looked at her face, eyes closed, tongue flicking her lips, and a look of utter bliss.</p>
<p>God she was just so beautiful it hurt. I finally fed the last 2 inches into her tight cunt; she opened her eyes with an amazed look as she felt my balls and pubic hair against her mound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, is it all in?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got for you today Missy,&rdquo; I replied. You OK?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mumm,&rdquo; was what I got back in return. I quickened my pace 4 out 4 in, 6 out 6 in, till I was taking it just about all out except for the head.</p>
<p>Her flaps, Inner and outer had formed a perfect seal around the head of my prick, it&rsquo;s distended out and caved back in sliding along the length of my prick like velvet. The feeling was indescribable wonderfully good.</p>
<p>I was slamming just about the full length in and out when she went off again, if I thought the first one was loud this one was off the decibel scale she screamed like a banshee and shook like an epileptic my god what had I discovered in this 15  year old girl.</p>
<p>I fucked her hard through that orgasm and halfway through her next I unloaded the full contents of my poor swollen balls into the tight confines of her teenage pussy. I had shoved hard against her pubic bone I swear I could see her stomach muscles pulse as my prick fired Rope after rope of hot thick cum into her.</p>
<p>She squealed as her pussy gripped my prick, in a vice milking it of its entire load until it started to seep past the confines of her flaps.</p>
<p>I looked at her lying underneath me drenched in sweat, leaking cum and her own fluids, tears started rolling down my cheeks dropping onto her lips she looked at me with that serene smile on her face and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max Adams, I love you with all my heart if you want 10 babies, I&rsquo;ll have 10 babies but let&rsquo;s just have 2 or 3 for a start and work back from there OK my darling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Missy Moo you got a deal as I rolled onto my side to cuddle her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect it to be like this every time we make love,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Veronica as she cuddled up into my arms?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I said with best cheesy smile,&rdquo; I was a bit out of practice and well, you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re doing so I reckon It should be a lot better as we get more practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rotten shit,&rdquo; she yelled as she launched herself at me covering me with punches and kisses in equal measure, laughing all the time. I can&rsquo;t believe I love you, you lecherous old goat.</p>
<p>Me I just hugged her closer and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you love me too, and I resemble that statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but in hungry and sweaty and I bet you are as well.</p>
<p>I picked her up and carried her to the toilet I plonked her on the seat and walked out and turned on the shower I could hear her peeing as I adjusted the water temperature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God Max look at this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she opened her legs a river of cum cascaded out her pussy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t stopped,&rdquo; she said. As I looked into the bowl, it was full of cum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well it had been a while,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long is a While?&rdquo; Veronica asked wiping herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know about 4 or 5 days since I last came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, I hope my damn pill keeps working or I&rsquo;ll be the Hastings version of &ldquo;Octo Mum,&rdquo; she said as she stepped into the shower.</p>
<p>I went to the toilet and followed her in, grabbing the Raspberry body lotion to wash her back and front as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the Pill that&rsquo;s probably a good Idea,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I can see the headlines Hastings Councillor in Teenage Love Tryst as they carted me off to jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Councillor,&rdquo; she said no wonder everybody knows you, I suppose we will have to be careful around other people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep just, be a little bit circumspect in what we say or do. Just hang with Lauren and once we are a couple I say I met you through my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Lauren is going to pimp me out hey, I wonder how much she will charge and how much I will make,&rdquo; she said smiling.</p>
<p>I just looked at her and said&rdquo; Well I&rsquo;ll just make it a package deal You, Lauren and Holly, should turn over a few dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her you said that,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Poor Holly rented out by her lecherous old Father,&rdquo; as she soaped my prick in her hands.</p>
<p>It started to swell and grow under her touch. &ldquo;Look what I found mum, can I keep it?&rdquo; she squealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where it will fit,&rdquo; I said as I turned her face to the wall and started to feed it into her from behind as she bent over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God that feels so good, it feels Huge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you like It Mamm happy to oblige,&rdquo; I said as I steadily fed over half in one long plunge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah Jesus I&rsquo;m going split in two!&rdquo; she said pushing back as another 2 inches disappeared into her. I turned the shower off as I Shoved the final 2 inches up to the crack of her arse.</p>
<p>Her pink rosebud puckered as I sawed in and out of the tight confines of her teenage cunt. I could see her reflection in the shower screen as she massaged her clit, she screamed as I placed my well-lubed index finger in her puckered Arsehole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing back there?&rdquo; she panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can take it out if you like as I massaged it back and forward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels weird, but good, all at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait till I stick my tongue up there,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh God here I cum!&rdquo; she said as I felt her pussy squeeze tight and her arsehole even tighter. She squealed her cum into the cubicle as I tried to drive her through the wall with my Prick. As I plunged harder against her arse as by balls unloaded another massive dose of cum up her teen cunt.</p>
<p>I pulled out and lifted her up into a standing position as I turned the shower back on to clear out her cum drenched pussy. I pulled her flaps apart as I guided the shower head up to her open canal.</p>
<p>A mixture of water and cum came flushing out; she came again from the water on her clit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God you are such a Cum Slut,&rdquo; I said smiling.</p>
<p>Her hand grasped my balls, as she looked me square in the face. Her blue eyes angry like the sea. That is something you had better only call me with love in your heart. Because say it any other way and I&rsquo;ll cut your balls in your sleep.</p>
<p>I squeezed her hand on my balls, then moved it to her face, and gently kissed her eyes ears neck and finally her lips. I grabbed her mound and Said &ldquo;you had better do a really quick job, because otherwise you will be wearing this, as a scarf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will make you this promise I will Never Do anything to hurt you, that doesn&rsquo;t mean I won&rsquo;t make fun of you. That&rsquo;s just me don&rsquo;t worry I make more Fun of Me than I do anyone else.</p>
<p>I held her face and kissed her gently then harder as her breathing got deeper; I moved my face onto her cunt and sucked cum back into my mouth causing her to collapse once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God I can&rsquo;t believe how much I love you,&rdquo; I said looking into her tear filled eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same for me, sorry I got upset&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little shit you beat me to it&rdquo; I said Kissing her again, hard.</p>
<p>She melted into my arms a Final warm rinse and we stepped out of the shower to dry off.</p>
<p>We went down stairs in our cotton robes Veronica with a towel round her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your poison my sweet. What do you fancy? Pasta, Steak or Fish?&rdquo; I asked as I stood looking in the fridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pasta, please Max.&rdquo; Pasta it is then. I could hear Charlie dog whining down the hallway in the laundry, his nose pressed through the bars of the security gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had better go and check on the prisoner,&rdquo; I said as I placed a big pot of water on to boil with the other fry pan on low heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Charlie Dog what you have been up to Big Dog?&rdquo; he jumped up and down tongue hanging out with excitement to see me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronica, Charlie, Charlie Veronica,&rdquo; as I formally introduced them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a really cute looking dog,&rdquo; said Veronica. &ldquo;What is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Part Bichon part Aussie Terrier,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh his fur is so soft. I thought it would be wiry,&rdquo; she said patting him. &ldquo;Charlie, Calm Down or you will go back in,&rdquo; I said in a firm voice.</p>
<p>He finally settled down as we walked back into the kitchen to get lunch underway he sat at the end of the bench area near the stools on a mat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come into the kitchen area will he?&rdquo; Veronica asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he knows what&rsquo;s good for him,&rdquo; I replied cutting up the bacon and sun-dried tomatoes&rsquo; to place with the crushed garlic into the pan. &ldquo;Anchovies?&rdquo; I asked, holding the jar for Veronica to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea what you are missing out on!&rdquo; I said as I chopped them up to leave on the board &ldquo;Grab the block of Parmesan out of the Fridge along with that wrapped packet,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>I held the wrapping to my nose and sniffed a look of bliss on my face. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in there that has sent you into to Orbit?&rdquo; Veronica asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; I said unwrapping it. &ldquo;You eat ham?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. Love it,&rdquo; she smiled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK Miss, close your eyes and open your mouth and prepare to have your taste buds ruined for any other ham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes; I placed a piece of Ham in her mouth as she started to chew her eyes popped open in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;WOW that is freaking awesome. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imported Spanish Jamon ham, the pigs are fed acorns and the flavor goes into the Ham. Not Bad hey!&rdquo; I said smiling back as I handed her another piece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expensive,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Criminal,&rdquo; I replied handing her the packet. &ldquo;$122 per Kg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just wrong on any level,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever is importing that should be taken out and shot that is just so wrong,&rdquo; she said with all the indignity that only a teen could muster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked smiling back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just is,&rdquo; she said as my question finally hit home, she looked at me and looked at the Packet. &ldquo;Imported under license by Smart Industries Ultimo Sydney 2000,&rdquo; she read on the label.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; she squealed as my shit-eating grin finally registered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Laurens Uncle Dave called you &ldquo;Smarty or Smart Man&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t quite remember,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty as charged. Will I get that Gun so you can shoot me?&rdquo; I asked smiling and kissing her on the lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; she said finally wising up to my show and tell routine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doh Money, lots and lots of money&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At $122 per kg,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep I can&rsquo;t keep up with the demand,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t someone else import it instead of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless they want their asses sued of them they won&rsquo;t, a couple tried it on, I now own a factory in Ultimo as a result of their stupid fucking Lawyers, I asked them, then told them, then sued them. Poor bastards. It had been in their family for over 65 years,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was all she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; I said placing some of the anchovy&rsquo;s with some cream in the frying pan and mixing it in. I lifted some on a fork for her to taste. &ldquo;Trust Me,&rdquo; was all I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yum,&rdquo; was what I got back in return as I put the rest in and mixed in the cream to finish it off. Grated Parmesan to finish done.</p>
<p>I gave Charlie dog a piece of cheese and Ham. They were gone in seconds flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go On Bugger off that&rsquo;s all your getting,&rdquo; as I finally handed him another piece of cheese. &ldquo;Outside Now, scoot&rdquo; he bolted outside with his treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his special treat Dogs love cheese, But Cheese doesn&rsquo;t love dogs, too much will kill them,&rdquo; I said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Charlie?&rdquo; she asked out of the blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;why Veronica?&rdquo; I asked back.</p>
<p>She laughed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re such a dick,&rdquo; she smiled shoveling pasta into her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Expert on my dick dear one,&rdquo; I countered as she nearly choked on her pasta while laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people who owned the bitch were called Chaplain, Boy Dog, and Charlie Chaplain,&rdquo; I replied shoveling pasta as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny&rdquo; she smiled &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like a Charlie,&rdquo; she said as she attacked the rest of my pasta on my plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The relationship has gone to that level hey, stealing food from old people,&rdquo; I said as I started to tickle her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not old,&rdquo; she smiled as I stopped the assault. &ldquo;Yet&rdquo; she said as she grabbed the last portion of my plate and stuffed into her mouth.</p>
<p>I grabbed her by the waist and lifted her down onto the big fluffy rug in the dining area her robe had opened exposing her breasts and pussy.</p>
<p>I launched a full frontal assault on her defenseless assets sucking biting nibbling; she then grabbed my hard prick and was in the process of trying to separate it from my body through force.</p>
<p>As we rolled around on the rug my trusty hound mounted a rear end attack, he started furiously licking her exposed clit and labia.</p>
<p>She landed on my chest in shock, squealing in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You OK?&rdquo; I asked as her eyes started to glaze over. &ldquo;You want me to get him away?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. No. Oh god that feels so good,&rdquo; she swooned into my chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lauren seems to like it,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lauren OMG,&rdquo; she squeaked as Charlie kept up the rear attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lauren really how, why?&rdquo; she said as she started to cum from Charlies Tongue.</p>
<p>She moaned biting my chest and nipple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boyfriend dramas. He broke her heart and took her cherry and dumped her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veronica stopped biting as Charlie stopped licking she saw his 5&rsquo;&rsquo; prick exposed with his 4&rsquo;&rsquo; knot and whimpered at the sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Lauren you know, do it all,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep the full Monty&rdquo; I said quietly into her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will you think of me if I do that?&rdquo; she said little girl voiced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing you can do, and nothing you will ever do, will ever stop me loving you as much as I love you now,&rdquo; I said kissing her lips and face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roll Over on your back Knees up legs open,&rdquo; I said as I supported her on my chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here Boy make my girl happy, Big Dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bounded up onto her chest his prick hard pressed against her mound. As he entered her with one, swift fucking thrust of his back legs.</p>
<p>She arched her back and raised her arse as he hammered like a machine gun in and out of her of her tight teen cunt.</p>
<p>She spasmed, as series of orgasms engulfed her body, her fingers digging into my thighs as his knot finally entered her tunnel and he pumped gallons of watery doggy cum deep into her teen cunt.</p>
<p>I could feel tears on my arms as he finally stopped pumping and pulled out with a loud Popping sound. The watery doggy cum flowed out. As he started to clean up his own cum with his tongue, another series of smaller orgasms engulfed Veronica&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, enough,&rdquo; she gasped, as she panted trying to catch her breath lying on her back.</p>
<p>I took Charlie back to his room and locked the gate.</p>
<p>She was lying on her back arms and hands on her face trying to stop the flood of tears.</p>
<p>I knelt down between her open thighs moving her arms and hands from her face as I kissed her closed eyes licking away her tears.</p>
<p>She opened them and said, &ldquo;I love you and hate you at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; I replied they just one side each of the same coin. &ldquo;I will show you how much I love you, OK?&rdquo; I opened her thighs right up and attacked her still dripping doggy cum filled cunt with equal ferocity.</p>
<p>I nibbled and chewed her flaps, I bit her clit, and I fucked her with my tongue.</p>
<p>I dredged every bit of doggy juice I could find. She orgasm ed, with a Blood curdling yell as I stuffed my full length of my prick up her cunt right up to, and into the neck of her teen womb.</p>
<p>My hands grasped her shoulders as I fucked her hard into the timber floor, unloaded thick rivers of cum into her freshly fucked cunt.</p>
<p>She passed out as I pumped my final load into her. I held her close as I rolled over on my side cradling her body into mine.</p>
<p>Her eyes fluttered open, as she looked at me with amazement on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still love me?&rdquo; I asked as I kissed her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than you can ever know,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>I kissed her on the lips transferring a bit of Doggy cum into her mouth, her eyes opened wide at the new watery taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep&rdquo; my furry Boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weird taste,&rdquo; she said as I could see her trying to work it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almonds,&rdquo; I said as that registered in her brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea watery, doggy cum covered almonds&rdquo; she squeaked whilst rolling on the rug with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like some on your ham?&rdquo; I asked as I got up to go to the fridge to get us a drink and a post coital snack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog Biscuits per chance,&rdquo; I said sotto voice; this sent her into a coughing bout of hysterical laughter.</p>
<p>As she rolled on her side, her pink rosebud appeared to flutter open.</p>
<p>I promptly stuck the end of my tongue into her virginal arse and proceeded to fuck it for all it was worth. The resulting scream was worth the price of admission. I probed, licked, sucked and put more than 30 years of acquired skill into that anal assault.</p>
<p>I pinched her clit between my fingers, which resulted in further access to the buttery passage of her anal canal.</p>
<p>She squirmed to escape my assault but to no avail. There was In addition, a massive amount of Juice leaking from her cunt onto my hand.</p>
<p>I promptly used that to further coat her anal opening allowing even more of my tongue to enter her rectum.</p>
<p>By this stage, her cunt and thighs were awash with her cum, not to mention the rug as well. Me I just kept tonguing away.</p>
<p>Veronica started begging and pleading for me to cease my anal attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry my darling I got carried away,&rdquo; I said as I kissed her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will have to carry me away if you keep that up,&rdquo; she said collapsing like a wet dishcloth, onto the rug straight into a pool of Charlies and my Cum.</p>
<p>She placed her hand on her back. &ldquo;Bugger, I don&rsquo;t really care,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really care if I bugger you, oh goody, how exciting. Roll over, brace position, get ready to repel boarders,&rdquo; I said in my best Plummy English accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it your killing me,&rdquo; Veronica moaned as she lay on her back laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead People Sex as well, fantastic and it&rsquo;s not even my birthday!&rdquo; I exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>I lifted her into a sitting position, walked back into the kitchen and gave her a bottle of Gatorade to drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here this should help,&rdquo; I said as I wiped her face and neck with a damp tea towel. She finished her drink as I continued to wipe her breasts and pussy.</p>
<p>I sniffed and licked the tea towel as I finished wiping her pussy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gross,&rdquo; she said laughing, &ldquo;You are just so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not wrong there,&rdquo; said Lauren, standing at the kitchen bench looking down on us smiling.</p>
