  "articleBody": "For the trial run of the exciting but risky idea, Sean decided Hannah should wear one of her regular kiddie T-shirts - Bratz doll cartoon on the front - plus her short pair of blue shorts. They were the type that went so high on her hips that her butt cheeks were almost exposed. They looked pretty normal for a 10-year-old girl in summer, but it would be a little unusual for one to be seen in them on a cool September evening on the Riverside Industrial estate. It would be unusual for such a young girl to be seen there, full stop. But it was where Hannah was going, with Sean’s supervision. Far too dangerous for her to go there alone: besides, she would have little or no idea on the business side of things. No make-up, decided Sean - as the whole point of a child is to look like a child, in his view - but just a little touch of lipstick to reinforce her purpose for being out there. Her hair could remain in its natural, somewhat straggly and free-flowing style - again, to enhance her typical age-quality.\nAlready, just over half an hour in, she had attracted attention. It was obvious to Sean, if not Hannah, that several motorists had slowed a little to ’take a look’ as she ambled slowly along the quayside. She was doing quite well at making a point of looking at each car, and idly tossing her hair as she walked. In fact, it was surprising how natural it looked for a 10-year-old to be doing this, mused Sean. She looked smaller still against the big old factory walls and, when the drivers registered ‘what’ she was, some drove on pretty sharpish whereas others seemed to give things more deliberate thought. Still, nobody actually pulled over until one blue peugeot took the bait. The driver could of course have been an ‘undercover’, but Sean had spotted him on two previous passes looking like a typical nervous punter. Whoever it was, his nerves must have been tenfold on seeing that Hannah was a child. But he’d stopped, and that spoke volumes, especially when coupled with the signal that Sean and Hannah had agreed. She raised her hand - which meant ’enquiry’ from the driver - so Sean stepped out from the shadows to enter the negotiations. Hannah had done okay, but the stupid kid had a lot to learn, and Sean would take care of it from here lest she find herself getting bum-raped for free.\n“Hi, relax pal, I’m her stepdad,” said Sean.\n“Oh, I see.” The guy looked like a typical eloquent businessman type - greying, a touch thinning, 40ish - maybe a manager even judging by the nice car, and very possibly married.\n“If I was cop, I wouldn’t be using these tactics with a kid, would I?”\n“Uh, I suppose not.”\n“So, you interested?” Sean smiled calmly. “Hannah here says you are.”\n“She does?”\n“Yes, when she waved for me to come out.” Hannah meanwhile stood there, shuffling around but intently listening and glancing at the two men in turn.\n“Well, she was right.” The driver appeared to swallow. “What now?”\n“What now is we move on from here quick. It’s not totally safe.”\n“We?”\n“Well, yes, you understand I can’t trust her to go alone. That would not be sensible of me at all.”\n“I can understand that.”\n“Don’t worry, you can do whatever you want to do in private, but we just have to get somewhere safe first.”\nThe man swallowed again, and looked like he was perspiring a little. He didn’t look all that fat or unfit, so Sean guessed it was likely the nerves of contemplating the highly sexy - and highly childhood-aged - person on the pavement by his car. “Okay, I see.”\n“So, shall we get in?” asked Sean.\n“Come on, then.”\nSean ushered a mildly perturbed Hannah into the front passenger seat, while he climbed into the back. He told the driver to leave the Industrial Estate calmly, whereupon he’d give him directions to a safe place on the outskirts of the city.\n* * * *\nRobert Saint couldn’t quite believe he was driving along with a 10-year-old girl passenger he had never seen in his life before but, curiously enough, he felt he could get used to the idea very quickly. The rugged-looking step-father pimp in the back seat made him more nervous, though. He had introduced himself as Sean, and it felt odd to be on first-name terms with a guy whose child he was contemplating having sexually.\n“Hi Sean, I’m Robert.”\n“This, as I said, is Hannah.”\n“Hi, Hannah,” said Robert, nicely, not knowing how else to talk to a child you wanted sex with. Simply be polite and courteous with her, one supposed.\n“Hi.” She seemed a bit nervous, but not hostile towards him.\n“I’ll talk business,” said Sean, “and see if you want to take it from there.”\n“Okay,” said Robert, hardly daring to imagine what would be on offer.\n“Since this is your first time with us, it’s just the basic package…”\nThe potential implicit in ‘first time’ was not lost on Robert, who tried to concentrate on his driving while listening to the pimp-details and taking in the exquisitely smooth and soft little legs next to him. Surely she was too small to be fucked, even though the idea of it was awesome.\n“Basic includes full nudity, free body touching but not fingering, free kissing and licking anywhere, and a choice of handjob or blowjob without condom - cums anywhere on body or in mouth.”\nRobert drove on steadily to the outskirts, taking a moment to absorb the amazing details, and to think of a response that was both honest but kept the pair ‘onside’ too. “She’ll ‘give’ blowjob, you mean?”\n“Yes,” said Sean. “And I should have said, you can take a half an hour for it, whatever you do.”\nRobert cleared his throat. “Ugh, cool, that sounds long enough.” He glanced edgily at the child, who seemed to listen to the details with a kind of distant equilibrium.\n“So, any questions, preferences?”\n“Um, blowjob, then… how much?”\n“�50. That’s on top of �25 basic package for the touching, kissing and nudity stuff.”\n“Um, yes, I’d definately want all that,” said Robert, reflecting on the child’s lovely face and nice mouth. “So, that would be �75 altogether for half…”\n“Half an hour, yeah, to do all that. If you can cum more than once then that’s fine, no extra charge.”\n“I can go with that.” About 4 hours wages, mused Robert, but worth it. “Um, fingering or fucking off limits, then?”\n“For this once, yes, sorry.” Hannah payed particular attention now. “Until we’ve got to know you, you understand? That’s assuming you’d want to come back.”\n“Uh, yes, I think I would. I’ve never done this before, you know. Um, not like this. I mean, not with underage.” He said it half to Hannah, almost apologetically, but it did not seem to mean anything to her.\n“We neither,” said Sean. “Not like this.”\n“Not out on the street, you mean?”\n“Exactly. So I’m kind of feeling my way, so hope you think the terms are fair.”\n“They are, yes. So, Hannah has… ’experience’, then?”\n“Yes. But that means she knows what she’s doing.”\n“Okay, just wondered.”\n“You give a very good blow-job, don’t you, sweetie?” asked Sean. Hannah nodded. Sean ruffled her hair from behind. “Good girl.”\n“So, maybe next time I could go further?”\n“Yes. Hey, I tell you what: finger-fucking for an extra �25 per hole? Make it a round ‘100’. How’s that? I’m only saying because you seem the type we can trust, and you’d make a good regular.”\n“Thanks, uh, I think.” Robert chuckled, and felt a little shocked at himself for the sudden levity.\n“Okay. �100 altogether, and can include everything from kissing to finger-fucking to a blow-job?”\n“Yes, and I’ll stay a short distance away from the car, but discreetly leave you to it, okay?”\n“Okay, I’ll settle for that,” said Robert.\n“Just go carefully on the fingers: Hannah will tell you if it’s hurting, anyway, just talk with her as you’re going along.”\n“Certainly.” Robert glanced at her again, expecting some kind of juvenile resentment but detecting mostly just caution.\n“Don’t use the same finger for vagina and anus, for her hygiene’s sake, you know?”\n“Um, understood,” said Robert.\nSean directed him to an abandoned trailer park on a hillside just outside town. On the way, Sean conversed about what he liked about Hannah’s features, and it relaxed Robert considerably for the activities ahead. In the company of one who ‘understood’, it was surprisingly how quickly it felt normal to treat a child sexually. It was no less exciting for it, though, and he had to pinch himself at the prospect of seeing the lovely 10-year-old form next to him naked.\nHe pulled his Peugeot in well to the back of gravelly grounds, and the first stirrings of his erection proper began the moment he turned the engine off.\nThe End\n",

<p>&ldquo;Hi, Hannah,&rdquo; said Robert, nicely, not knowing how else to talk to a child you wanted sex with. Simply be polite and courteous with her, one supposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; She seemed a bit nervous, but not hostile towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk business,&rdquo; said Sean, &ldquo;and see if you want to take it from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said Robert, hardly daring to imagine what would be on offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since this is your first time with us, it&rsquo;s just the basic package&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The potential implicit in &lsquo;first time&rsquo; was not lost on Robert, who tried to concentrate on his driving while listening to the pimp-details and taking in the exquisitely smooth and soft little legs next to him. Surely she was too small to be fucked, even though the idea of it was awesome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Basic includes full nudity, free body touching but not fingering, free kissing and licking anywhere, and a choice of handjob or blowjob without condom - cums anywhere on body or in mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert drove on steadily to the outskirts, taking a moment to absorb the amazing details, and to think of a response that was both honest but kept the pair &lsquo;onside&rsquo; too. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll &lsquo;give&rsquo; blowjob, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;And I should have said, you can take a half an hour for it, whatever you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert cleared his throat. &ldquo;Ugh, cool, that sounds long enough.&rdquo; He glanced edgily at the child, who seemed to listen to the details with a kind of distant equilibrium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, any questions, preferences?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, blowjob, then&hellip; how much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;�50. That&rsquo;s on top of �25 basic package for the touching, kissing and nudity stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, yes, I&rsquo;d definately want all that,&rdquo; said Robert, reflecting on the child&rsquo;s lovely face and nice mouth. &ldquo;So, that would be �75 altogether for half&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half an hour, yeah, to do all that. If you can cum more than once then that&rsquo;s fine, no extra charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go with that.&rdquo; About 4 hours wages, mused Robert, but worth it. &ldquo;Um, fingering or fucking off limits, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this once, yes, sorry.&rdquo; Hannah payed particular attention now. &ldquo;Until we&rsquo;ve got to know you, you understand? That&rsquo;s assuming you&rsquo;d want to come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, yes, I think I would. I&rsquo;ve never done this before, you know. Um, not like this. I mean, not with underage.&rdquo; He said it half to Hannah, almost apologetically, but it did not seem to mean anything to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We neither,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;Not like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not out on the street, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. So I&rsquo;m kind of feeling my way, so hope you think the terms are fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are, yes. So, Hannah has&hellip; &rsquo;experience&rsquo;, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But that means she knows what she&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, just wondered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give a very good blow-job, don&rsquo;t you, sweetie?&rdquo; asked Sean. Hannah nodded. Sean ruffled her hair from behind. &ldquo;Good girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, maybe next time I could go further?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Hey, I tell you what: finger-fucking for an extra �25 per hole? Make it a round &lsquo;100&rsquo;. How&rsquo;s that? I&rsquo;m only saying because you seem the type we can trust, and you&rsquo;d make a good regular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, uh, I think.&rdquo; Robert chuckled, and felt a little shocked at himself for the sudden levity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. �100 altogether, and can include everything from kissing to finger-fucking to a blow-job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ll stay a short distance away from the car, but discreetly leave you to it, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll settle for that,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just go carefully on the fingers: Hannah will tell you if it&rsquo;s hurting, anyway, just talk with her as you&rsquo;re going along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Robert glanced at her again, expecting some kind of juvenile resentment but detecting mostly just caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use the same finger for vagina and anus, for her hygiene&rsquo;s sake, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, understood,&rdquo; said Robert.</p>
<p>Sean directed him to an abandoned trailer park on a hillside just outside town. On the way, Sean conversed about what he liked about Hannah&rsquo;s features, and it relaxed Robert considerably for the activities ahead. In the company of one who &lsquo;understood&rsquo;, it was surprisingly how quickly it felt normal to treat a child sexually. It was no less exciting for it, though, and he had to pinch himself at the prospect of seeing the lovely 10-year-old form next to him naked.</p>
<p>He pulled his Peugeot in well to the back of gravelly grounds, and the first stirrings of his erection proper began the moment he turned the engine off.</p>
<p>The End</p>
