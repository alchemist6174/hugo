  "articleBody": "The girl poked her head in my car window.\n“You’re Betsy’s dad, aren’t you?”\nI recognized her: Hailey, from my daughter’s dance team. She was a super-cute little eleven year old, short and thin, with an intelligent face and a sarcastic smile. But what attracted most of my attention were the wonderful little buds on her chest; they were quite small, round little plum-sized preteen breasts, but it was delightful how much they stood up, poking out at least an inch and a half from her skinny chest. She was at that awkward age where she didn’t like bras and would often go without, if her mom wasn’t paying attention, and then the world was treated to the wonderful display of her unrestrained little plumpies shimmying delightfully while she danced.\n“Right? You’re Betsy’s dad?” she asked again, awakening me from my preteen-boobie-inspired mesmeration.\n“No,” I said, “I just like to sit in the parking lot when your dance class lets out.”\n“Maybe you’re a stalker,” she said.\n“Maybe I am.”\nShe flashed me a wicked smile. “Strangers have the best candy.”\n“Damn, I’m all out of candy.”\n“Then I won’t get in your car.” She pulled her head back out of the window. “See ya later!”\n“Yep! And I’ll make sure I have some candy!”\nShe grinned, then waved.\nI felt a little foolish buying a bag of candy at the grocery store before I picked my daughter up from dance class the next week. I chose carefully, both to maximize its appeal to an eleven year old girl, and to provide some measure of satisfaction for my own prurient interests. A bag of Hello Kitty lollipops was just the ticket.\nHailey came out of the dance class first, like she usually does. Most of the girls would hang out chatting and changing, my daughter chief among them, but Hailey was always the first one out. She saw me sitting in the car and veered over in my direction. I noticed she’d neglected to wear a bra this morning, and as she approached the car, I watched her cute little boobies giggle with each step.\n“Got any candy, mister?” she asked me, grinning mischievously.\n“Why would I have candy?”\n“‘Cause you’re a pedophile.”\n“Yeah? What does that mean?”\n“It means you like young girls. They taught us that in school.”\n“Yeah? What else did they teach you?”\n“That strangers have the best candy.”\n“Well, look what I have here.” I took a lollipop out of the bag that I had hidden in the pocket on the door.\n“A Hello Kitty lollipop! I love Hello Kitty!”\n“I thought maybe you would.”\nShe opened up the lollipop and licked it. “Did you buy this just for me?”\n“Sure.”\n“You really are a stalker, aren’t you?”\n“Maybe I am.”\n“You do have the best candy.” She plopped the lollipop in her mouth, gave me a little wave, and turned and walked away.\nThe next week, my ex-wife took my daughter to see her grandparents in Pittsburgh, so no dance class. But I still had all these lollipops and nothing to do with them; seems a shame, when I know a girl who likes them.\nI’d noticed last week, as I watched Hailey’s cute little eleven year old butt wiggle as she walked away, that there was no one to pick her up; she walks home after dance class. Since it looked like it might start raining, I of course felt practically obligated to offer the poor girl a ride home.\n“Would you like some candy?” I said to her out my car window.\nShe grinned. “Betsy wasn’t in class today, what’re you doing here?”\n“Maybe I’m a stalker.” I handed her a lollipop.\n“Maybe you are.” She unwrapped the lollipop and licked it, looking rather suspiciously at me.\n“You should get in my car.”\n“Why?”\n“‘Cause I just gave you candy. You said you’d get in my car if I gave you candy.”\nShe licked the lollipop, staring at me. “No I didn’t.”\n“I’m pretty sure you did. But seriously, it looks like it’s going to rain. I’ll give you a ride home, OK?”\n“Is that all? Just a ride home?”\n“Sure, yeah. Why, you have something else in mind?”\n“Yeah,” She said in the best imitation of a sultry voice that an eleven year old could muster. She paused, looking at me, her eyes squinting. My heart was racing, wondering what this little hottie was going to come up with.\n“Ice cream!” she said with a big grin. “Buy me some ice cream!”\nI had to laugh. The little cocktease really had me going. “Sure, get in, we’ll go to Joe’s and get a cone.”\n“Yay!” She climbed into the front passenger seat.\nWhen we got to Joe’s, I suggested she should call her parents so they wouldn’t be worried.\n“They’re not home, they went to some marriage counseling ‘retreat’ and they won’t be back ’till late, so I got nowhere to go, you can buy me all the ice cream you want.”\n“Don’t you think that’s enough ice cream?” I said, pointing at the double-scoop cone in her hand.\nShe looked at it. “I suppose. You can buy me other stuff!”\n“Like what?”\n“Candy!”\n“Is that all you think about, is sweets?”\n“I thought that’s what you stalkers liked to do, is buy us sweets.”\nI looked around at the tables near us. “Shh!”\nShe grinned. “Sorry,” she said more quietly, leaning forward. “I thought that’s what you stalkers liked to do,” she said again in almost a whisper.\n“What kind of candy do you like?” I asked quietly.\n“Chocolate.”\n“You want me to buy you some chocolates?”\nShe grinned. “Would you really?”\n“Sure, whatever you want.”\n“Whatever I want? I want a Ferrari.”\n“OK, but you’re gonna have to be really nice to me for that.”\nShe eyed me. “What do you mean, ‘really nice?’”\n“What do you think I mean?”\nShe leaned forward, staring at me with a mockingly serious look, and whispered, very quietly, “I think you’re talking about sex.”\n“Me? No!” I feigned innocence, and she giggled. “So, would you? Would you do that for a Ferrari?”\n“I can’t even drive!”\n“But would you?”\nShe sat back and plopped the last of her ice cream cone in her mouth. “Ib dobn’t mabber,” she said as she chewed it down, “because you’d never buy me one anyway.”\n“What would you do for a nice box of chocolates?”\nShe pursed her lips. “How nice?”\n“As nice as they come.”\n“Godiva?”\n“Sure.”\n“A big box of Godiva truffles?”\n“Sure.”\nShe looked around furtively, then lean forward. “Are you really going to buy me a big box of Godiva truffles?”\n“Sure.”\n“What if I don’t do anything?”\n“That’s OK.”\n“You’d still buy them for me, even if I won’t do anything?”\n“Sure, of course.”\nShe leaned even closer and opened her mouth as if to say something but swallowed her words; then she said, “I’ll… I’ll do something.”\nMy heart was racing. I didn’t know what she meant by “something,” but I sure wanted to find out.\nWe left Joe’s in a bit of a hurry–at least I was in a bit of a hurry–and I drove to the nearest chocolate shop, where I bought the biggest box of Godiva truffles that they had. Then I took her back to my house.\nShe sat down on the couch in my living room and put the box of truffles on the coffee table in front of her. She tore the cellophane off and lifted the cover. Her eyes sparkled and she smiled. “You have the best candy!” she said, carefully selecting a truffle with a white chocolate checker pattern and plopping it in her mouth.\nI stood, looking down at her. She looked up at me as she plopped a second one in her mouth. “Are youb going to hab one?”\n“No, I’m fine.”\nShe plopped another one in her mouth.\n“So, you said if I got you chocolates, you’d do something for me?”\nShe looked up at me, her mouth full, her eyes glazed with a sugar rush. “Whab do youb wan’ me to dob?”\n“I get to choose?”\n“Sureb.”\n“Anything? Anything at all?”\nShe plopped her fourth truffle in her mouth. Her cheeks were starting to look like a chipmunk’s.\n“Shu’.” She couldn’t form words at this point.\n“Do you know what a blowjob is?”\nShe looked at me and swallowed some of the chocolate in her mouth. “Youb wab me to gib youb a blowjob?”\n“Sure! You know what it is?”\nShe looked at me, a bit dumbfounded, but she nodded. “Uh-huh.”\nI walked in front of her and put my thumb and forefinger on her chin. “Open your mouth,” I said, forcing her chin down. I could see her mouth full of truffle goo. As I forced her chin down, I dropped my shorts and underwear. “Suck me,” I said, stuffing my cock into her chocolate-filled mouth.\nShe looked up at me, her eyes wide with surprise and concern. I put my hands on the back of her head, wrapping my fingers in her hair. I pulled my hips back and pushed in. “Suck!” I said loudly. Her eyes were even wider now, with what might have been fear, and she tried to suck but as she did I heard a gurgling sound from her throat and I knew she was going to gag. I pulled my cock out of her mouth.\nShe kept looking up at me, eyes wide, her mouth open; truffle goo was drooling down her chin and a big string of chocolate-colored spittle hung between her mouth and my cockhead. My penis was smeared brown and dripping with truffle goo.\nShe closed her mouth and swallowed down the rest of the truffle goo. “Look,” I said, laughing, “there’s chocolate on my cock!” She looked down, her eyes crossing to focus on the penis in front of her. “You should lick it,” I said, holding it up in front of her by the base. She looked up at me with those same wide eyes, and stuck her tongue out and started licking the chocolate off of my cock. She seemed to me to be more enthusiastic about it than I had expected.\n“Does it taste good?”\nShe nodded, licking. “Like chocolate,” she said.\n“I do have the best candy, don’t I?”\nShe looked up at me, her eyes narrower now and twinkling, but she just kept licking.\nI stepped back and dropped my cock, so that it was facing right at her, then put my thumb and forefinger on her chin again. “Open your mouth,” I said again, and then I pushed my cockhead back in. As she sucked, I started jacking.\nIt didn’t take long before the young girl got her reward. I put my free hand on the back of her head, wrapping my fingers in her soft hair. “Oh, fuck, Hailey, take it all! Take it all!” I held her tightly in place as the first shot boiled, hot and thick, inside my body and then fired down her throat with amazing force. She was looking up at me, her wide eyes narrowing, her face grimacing, and she looked like she was going to throw up. But I held her in place and fired the next shot, and the next, and the next. I pulled out and let the last couple of smaller shots twitch out onto her shirt.\nShe sat there, her mouth hanging open, semen drooling down her chin, her face contorted in a grimace; she coughed a couple of times. I reached around and grabbed a truffle and stuffed it in her mouth. “Here, this should help it taste better.”\nShe had no choice but to chew the truffle and swallow everything in her mouth.\nAfter she’d swallowed, Hailey looked down at her shirt; there were several large drips of chocolate that had drooled out of her mouth, running down the front of the shirt, as well as large dollops of semen.\n“My shirt’s all messy,” she said.\n“Yeah, I’ll wash it, OK? Let me grab you one of my shirts to wear, OK?”\nI ran up to my room, grabbed a tee-shirt, and ran back down. When I handed her the tee-shirt, she just immediately pulled her shirt off, not a moment’s hesitation, and for the briefest time before she’d pulled my tee-shirt on, I got to see her naked little baby breasts. They were just little chubby plum-sized mounds of flesh, not even the size of peaches yet, covered in their entirety by swollen pink nipples. Despite the fact that I had just ejaculated a couple of minutes earlier, I could feel my cock rising in delight at the sight of her little preteen boobies.\nI took her shirt downstairs to the laundry, rinsed it off, and put it in the washing machine. By now, my hard-on was raging again, all sorts of thoughts rushing through my brain.\nWhen I got back upstairs, she was sitting over the box of truffles, her mouth full of candy again. She looked up at me and smiled. I reached a hand out to her.\n“Come with me,” I said.\nShe took my hand. “Where arb be going?”\n“I want to show you my bedroom,” I said.\nI helped her to her feet and led her up the stairs. Once we were in my room, I sat down on my bed and pulled her in to me. I lifted my tee-shirt off of her, her delightful little plums exposed again. Then I hooked my thumbs in the waistband of her shorts and pulled them down.\n“You’re gonna have to buy me more candy,” she said quietly, her voice cracking.\n“You have half a box of truffles downstairs.” Her shorts and panties fell to her feet and I could see little curls of light-brown hair on her pubic mound.\n“You have to buy me another one if you want to do this to me.”\n“I’ll buy you all the candy you want.”\n“OK.”\nI lay her down on my bed and pulled my shorts off. My hard-on was full and proud, completely engorged and ready to take his prize. I climbed on top of her, pushing her legs open with my knees, and directed my cock down to her little slit.\nShe was wet and warm as her lips wrapped sensuously around my head. She was staring up at me, wide-eyed, as I gripped my cock and pushed into her. She gasped, I pulled back and pushed in again, and I felt her hymen tear.\nI made love to the little girl for quite a while; she was tiny underneath me, when I lay down on her entirely, her head came up no further than my chest. Her vaginal canal was so small that my cock barely fit, I could get no more than about three inches of my shaft into her. But it was enough; the feeling of her wet, silky lips sliding up and down my cock as I fucked her was fantastic and I brought myself to a wonderful orgasm, unloading what little semen I had left into her immature body.\nI felt very guilty as I pulled out of her, but she was smiling, a big, happy grin.\n“I knew you wanted to do that to me,” she said as I drove her home. “I knew, the second you gave me that lollipop, that you wanted to do that to me.”\n“I’m that predictable?”\n“You’re a guy. Guys only want one thing, right?” She grinned, then popped the last truffle into her mouth.\n“Did they tell you that in school?”\n“Yeah, right after they told us that strangers have the best the candy.”\n“So is it true? Do I have the best candy?”\n“You’re not a stranger. But you do have the best candy.”\n“Speaking of candy, I’ll buy you another box of truffles, like I promised, but you have to come over to my house tomorrow to get them.”\n“OK.” She smiled, like she was thinking something. “You just want me to come over so you can do that to me again.”\n“Maybe. But only if you want to.”\nShe grinned teasingly at me. “Do I get the truffles even if I don’t want to?”\n“I don’t know, we’ll have to see.”\n“I’ll do anything for candy, you know.”\n",

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Betsy&rsquo;s dad, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I recognized her: Hailey, from my daughter&rsquo;s dance team. She was a super-cute little eleven year old, short and thin, with an intelligent face and a sarcastic smile. But what attracted most of my attention were the wonderful little buds on her chest; they were quite small, round little plum-sized preteen breasts, but it was delightful how much they stood up, poking out at least an inch and a half from her skinny chest. She was at that awkward age where she didn&rsquo;t like bras and would often go without, if her mom wasn&rsquo;t paying attention, and then the world was treated to the wonderful display of her unrestrained little plumpies shimmying delightfully while she danced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right? You&rsquo;re Betsy&rsquo;s dad?&rdquo; she asked again, awakening me from my preteen-boobie-inspired mesmeration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I just like to sit in the parking lot when your dance class lets out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re a stalker,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flashed me a wicked smile. &ldquo;Strangers have the best candy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn, I&rsquo;m all out of candy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t get in your car.&rdquo; She pulled her head back out of the window. &ldquo;See ya later!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep! And I&rsquo;ll make sure I have some candy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grinned, then waved.</p>
<hr>
<p>I felt a little foolish buying a bag of candy at the grocery store before I picked my daughter up from dance class the next week. I chose carefully, both to maximize its appeal to an eleven year old girl, and to provide some measure of satisfaction for my own prurient interests. A bag of Hello Kitty lollipops was just the ticket.</p>
<p>Hailey came out of the dance class first, like she usually does. Most of the girls would hang out chatting and changing, my daughter chief among them, but Hailey was always the first one out. She saw me sitting in the car and veered over in my direction. I noticed she&rsquo;d neglected to wear a bra this morning, and as she approached the car, I watched her cute little boobies giggle with each step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any candy, mister?&rdquo; she asked me, grinning mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would I have candy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re a pedophile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah? What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means you like young girls. They taught us that in school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah? What else did they teach you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That strangers have the best candy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look what I have here.&rdquo; I took a lollipop out of the bag that I had hidden in the pocket on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Hello Kitty lollipop! I love Hello Kitty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened up the lollipop and licked it. &ldquo;Did you buy this just for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really are a stalker, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do have the best candy.&rdquo; She plopped the lollipop in her mouth, gave me a little wave, and turned and walked away.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next week, my ex-wife took my daughter to see her grandparents in Pittsburgh, so no dance class. But I still had all these lollipops and nothing to do with them; seems a shame, when I know a girl who likes them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d noticed last week, as I watched Hailey&rsquo;s cute little eleven year old butt wiggle as she walked away, that there was no one to pick her up; she walks home after dance class. Since it looked like it might start raining, I of course felt practically obligated to offer the poor girl a ride home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like some candy?&rdquo; I said to her out my car window.</p>
<p>She grinned. &ldquo;Betsy wasn&rsquo;t in class today, what&rsquo;re you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m a stalker.&rdquo; I handed her a lollipop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you are.&rdquo; She unwrapped the lollipop and licked it, looking rather suspiciously at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should get in my car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause I just gave you candy. You said you&rsquo;d get in my car if I gave you candy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She licked the lollipop, staring at me. &ldquo;No I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure you did. But seriously, it looks like it&rsquo;s going to rain. I&rsquo;ll give you a ride home, OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all? Just a ride home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, yeah. Why, you have something else in mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; She said in the best imitation of a sultry voice that an eleven year old could muster. She paused, looking at me, her eyes squinting. My heart was racing, wondering what this little hottie was going to come up with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ice cream!&rdquo; she said with a big grin. &ldquo;Buy me some ice cream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to laugh. The little cocktease really had me going. &ldquo;Sure, get in, we&rsquo;ll go to Joe&rsquo;s and get a cone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; She climbed into the front passenger seat.</p>
<p>When we got to Joe&rsquo;s, I suggested she should call her parents so they wouldn&rsquo;t be worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not home, they went to some marriage counseling &lsquo;retreat&rsquo; and they won&rsquo;t be back &rsquo;till late, so I got nowhere to go, you can buy me all the ice cream you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s enough ice cream?&rdquo; I said, pointing at the double-scoop cone in her hand.</p>
<p>She looked at it. &ldquo;I suppose. You can buy me other stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all you think about, is sweets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that&rsquo;s what you stalkers liked to do, is buy us sweets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked around at the tables near us. &ldquo;Shh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grinned. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she said more quietly, leaning forward. &ldquo;I thought that&rsquo;s what you stalkers liked to do,&rdquo; she said again in almost a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of candy do you like?&rdquo; I asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chocolate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want me to buy you some chocolates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grinned. &ldquo;Would you really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, whatever you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever I want? I want a Ferrari.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, but you&rsquo;re gonna have to be really nice to me for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She eyed me. &ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;really nice?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned forward, staring at me with a mockingly serious look, and whispered, very quietly, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re talking about sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? No!&rdquo; I feigned innocence, and she giggled. &ldquo;So, would you? Would you do that for a Ferrari?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even drive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat back and plopped the last of her ice cream cone in her mouth. &ldquo;Ib dobn&rsquo;t mabber,&rdquo; she said as she chewed it down, &ldquo;because you&rsquo;d never buy me one anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do for a nice box of chocolates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pursed her lips. &ldquo;How nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As nice as they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Godiva?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big box of Godiva truffles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked around furtively, then lean forward. &ldquo;Are you really going to buy me a big box of Godiva truffles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t do anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d still buy them for me, even if I won&rsquo;t do anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned even closer and opened her mouth as if to say something but swallowed her words; then she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&hellip; I&rsquo;ll do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart was racing. I didn&rsquo;t know what she meant by &ldquo;something,&rdquo; but I sure wanted to find out.</p>
<p>We left Joe&rsquo;s in a bit of a hurry&ndash;at least I was in a bit of a hurry&ndash;and I drove to the nearest chocolate shop, where I bought the biggest box of Godiva truffles that they had. Then I took her back to my house.</p>
<p>She sat down on the couch in my living room and put the box of truffles on the coffee table in front of her. She tore the cellophane off and lifted the cover. Her eyes sparkled and she smiled. &ldquo;You have the best candy!&rdquo; she said, carefully selecting a truffle with a white chocolate checker pattern and plopping it in her mouth.</p>
<p>I stood, looking down at her. She looked up at me as she plopped a second one in her mouth. &ldquo;Are youb going to hab one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She plopped another one in her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you said if I got you chocolates, you&rsquo;d do something for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at me, her mouth full, her eyes glazed with a sugar rush. &ldquo;Whab do youb wan&rsquo; me to dob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get to choose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sureb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything? Anything at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She plopped her fourth truffle in her mouth. Her cheeks were starting to look like a chipmunk&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shu&rsquo;.&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t form words at this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what a blowjob is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me and swallowed some of the chocolate in her mouth. &ldquo;Youb wab me to gib youb a blowjob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! You know what it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me, a bit dumbfounded, but she nodded. &ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I walked in front of her and put my thumb and forefinger on her chin. &ldquo;Open your mouth,&rdquo; I said, forcing her chin down. I could see her mouth full of truffle goo. As I forced her chin down, I dropped my shorts and underwear. &ldquo;Suck me,&rdquo; I said, stuffing my cock into her chocolate-filled mouth.</p>
<p>She looked up at me, her eyes wide with surprise and concern. I put my hands on the back of her head, wrapping my fingers in her hair. I pulled my hips back and pushed in. &ldquo;Suck!&rdquo; I said loudly. Her eyes were even wider now, with what might have been fear, and she tried to suck but as she did I heard a gurgling sound from her throat and I knew she was going to gag. I pulled my cock out of her mouth.</p>
<p>She kept looking up at me, eyes wide, her mouth open; truffle goo was drooling down her chin and a big string of chocolate-colored spittle hung between her mouth and my cockhead. My penis was smeared brown and dripping with truffle goo.</p>
<p>She closed her mouth and swallowed down the rest of the truffle goo. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; I said, laughing, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s chocolate on my cock!&rdquo; She looked down, her eyes crossing to focus on the penis in front of her. &ldquo;You should lick it,&rdquo; I said, holding it up in front of her by the base. She looked up at me with those same wide eyes, and stuck her tongue out and started licking the chocolate off of my cock. She seemed to me to be more enthusiastic about it than I had expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it taste good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, licking. &ldquo;Like chocolate,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do have the best candy, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at me, her eyes narrower now and twinkling, but she just kept licking.</p>
<p>I stepped back and dropped my cock, so that it was facing right at her, then put my thumb and forefinger on her chin again. &ldquo;Open your mouth,&rdquo; I said again, and then I pushed my cockhead back in. As she sucked, I started jacking.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long before the young girl got her reward. I put my free hand on the back of her head, wrapping my fingers in her soft hair. &ldquo;Oh, fuck, Hailey, take it all! Take it all!&rdquo; I held her tightly in place as the first shot boiled, hot and thick, inside my body and then fired down her throat with amazing force. She was looking up at me, her wide eyes narrowing, her face grimacing, and she looked like she was going to throw up. But I held her in place and fired the next shot, and the next, and the next. I pulled out and let the last couple of smaller shots twitch out onto her shirt.</p>
<p>She sat there, her mouth hanging open, semen drooling down her chin, her face contorted in a grimace; she coughed a couple of times. I reached around and grabbed a truffle and stuffed it in her mouth. &ldquo;Here, this should help it taste better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had no choice but to chew the truffle and swallow everything in her mouth.</p>
<hr>
<p>After she&rsquo;d swallowed, Hailey looked down at her shirt; there were several large drips of chocolate that had drooled out of her mouth, running down the front of the shirt, as well as large dollops of semen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My shirt&rsquo;s all messy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll wash it, OK? Let me grab you one of my shirts to wear, OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ran up to my room, grabbed a tee-shirt, and ran back down. When I handed her the tee-shirt, she just immediately pulled her shirt off, not a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, and for the briefest time before she&rsquo;d pulled my tee-shirt on, I got to see her naked little baby breasts. They were just little chubby plum-sized mounds of flesh, not even the size of peaches yet, covered in their entirety by swollen pink nipples. Despite the fact that I had just ejaculated a couple of minutes earlier, I could feel my cock rising in delight at the sight of her little preteen boobies.</p>
<p>I took her shirt downstairs to the laundry, rinsed it off, and put it in the washing machine. By now, my hard-on was raging again, all sorts of thoughts rushing through my brain.</p>
<p>When I got back upstairs, she was sitting over the box of truffles, her mouth full of candy again. She looked up at me and smiled. I reached a hand out to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She took my hand. &ldquo;Where arb be going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to show you my bedroom,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>I helped her to her feet and led her up the stairs. Once we were in my room, I sat down on my bed and pulled her in to me. I lifted my tee-shirt off of her, her delightful little plums exposed again. Then I hooked my thumbs in the waistband of her shorts and pulled them down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna have to buy me more candy,&rdquo; she said quietly, her voice cracking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have half a box of truffles downstairs.&rdquo; Her shorts and panties fell to her feet and I could see little curls of light-brown hair on her pubic mound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to buy me another one if you want to do this to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you all the candy you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lay her down on my bed and pulled my shorts off. My hard-on was full and proud, completely engorged and ready to take his prize. I climbed on top of her, pushing her legs open with my knees, and directed my cock down to her little slit.</p>
<p>She was wet and warm as her lips wrapped sensuously around my head. She was staring up at me, wide-eyed, as I gripped my cock and pushed into her. She gasped, I pulled back and pushed in again, and I felt her hymen tear.</p>
<p>I made love to the little girl for quite a while; she was tiny underneath me, when I lay down on her entirely, her head came up no further than my chest. Her vaginal canal was so small that my cock barely fit, I could get no more than about three inches of my shaft into her. But it was enough; the feeling of her wet, silky lips sliding up and down my cock as I fucked her was fantastic and I brought myself to a wonderful orgasm, unloading what little semen I had left into her immature body.</p>
<p>I felt very guilty as I pulled out of her, but she was smiling, a big, happy grin.</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you wanted to do that to me,&rdquo; she said as I drove her home. &ldquo;I knew, the second you gave me that lollipop, that you wanted to do that to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m that predictable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a guy. Guys only want one thing, right?&rdquo; She grinned, then popped the last truffle into her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they tell you that in school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, right after they told us that strangers have the best the candy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is it true? Do I have the best candy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a stranger. But you do have the best candy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of candy, I&rsquo;ll buy you another box of truffles, like I promised, but you have to come over to my house tomorrow to get them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK.&rdquo; She smiled, like she was thinking something. &ldquo;You just want me to come over so you can do that to me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. But only if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grinned teasingly at me. &ldquo;Do I get the truffles even if I don&rsquo;t want to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, we&rsquo;ll have to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything for candy, you know.&rdquo;</p>
