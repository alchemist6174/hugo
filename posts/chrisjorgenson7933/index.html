  "articleBody": "The little bunny-rabbit sat on her back legs, her front paws held up to her chest. She twitched her little pink nose.\n“You’re a pretty little bunny-rabbit,” I said. “Can I pet you?”\nShe nodded, her furry white ears with pink insides nodding along.\nOn the television, the narrator’s voice intoned: “The Eastern Cottontail…”\nThe little bunny-rabbit leaned forward, lifting her bottom in the air to show me her little cottontail.\n“…mates promiscuously…” the narrator continued.\nI put my hand on her head and petted her hair. “What a sweet little cottontail!”\n“…the females having sometimes five or more mates during one brooding.”\nThe little bunny-rabbit sat back on her hind legs again, lifting her front paws to her chest, and watched the TV. On screen, one rabbit was crouched on her belly on the ground, her back arched and her bottom in the air, while another mounted her. The male made several rapid movements with his hips and about two seconds later the female jumped forward.\n“Female rabbits do not enter heat, but instead ovulate in response to mating.”\nThe male hopped forward to the female and mounted her again, pumping his hips.\nThe little bunny-rabbit looked at me and wrinkled her nose.\n“Female cottontails can have three or more broods a year, with between five and eight kits, and are usually ready to mate again shortly after giving birth.”\nThe little bunny-rabbit looked up at me, sitting on her hind legs, and twitched her nose.\n“It is because of this promiscuity and nearly constant mating,” the narrator continued, “that the rabbit has become a symbol of sexuality.”\nThe little bunny-rabbit and I both looked at the television screen, which was showing a naked woman wearing bunny ears, her breasts and pubic region blurred.\nThe little bunny-rabbit looked back at me and twitched her little pink nose.\n“It is also the reason that rabbits are a nuisance in some agricultural areas…”\nI grabbed the remote and clicked the television off.\n“Are you a symbol of sexuality, little bunny?” I asked her.\nThe little bunny-rabbit looked at me for a moment. She bit her lower lip, then gave a tiny little nod. “Yeah,” she said quietly in her childish little high-pitched voice.\n“Come over here, bunny,” I said.\nThe little bunny-rabbit slowly walked over to where I was sitting on the couch.\nI reached out and took hold of her shirt. “Bunnies usually don’t wear clothes, do they?”\nThe little bunny-rabbit looked at me for a moment, then gave a tiny shake of her head. “No,” she said quietly in her childish little high-pitched voice.\nI lifted her shirt up. She raised her arms in the air so I could pull it off. Her bunny ears fell off. I picked them up and handed them to her and she put them back on.\nI looked at the little bunny-rabbit’s bare chest in front of me, so pale, so small. She had no breasts at all; her nipples were fairly wide, but unerupted, flat against her skinny chest.\nHer nipples were as light pink as apple blossoms, as soft as powderpuffs, as delicate as wildflowers.\nI leaned in and nuzzled into the little bunny-rabbit’s belly as I took hold of the waistband of her shorts and pulled them down.\nThe little bunny-rabbit’s shorts and panties fell to her feet.\nI kissed her belly. Then I sat back and looked at her naked little nine-year-old pussy, smooth and white, her pubic mound rising provocative from her belly, little pale lips disappearing between her legs.\n“You lost your cottontail,” I said. The tail was stuck to her shorts with a bit of tape; I pulled the tail off her shorts and the little bunny-rabbit turned around so that her skinny little nine year old girlish bottom was facing me.\nI stuck the tail to her naked bottom, then I moved my finger down from the tail, down her bottom. I pushed it between her thighs until I was touching the girl’s little nine year old pussy. I pushed a finger into her, just a little. She was warm, and wet.\nThe little bunny-rabbit took a step away from me, then got down on her knees. She crouched and leaned down, her belly on the ground, her back arched and her bottom in the air. She looked up at me. Her face was red and she had a serious, and perhaps a bit concerned, look. But she twitched her little pink nose.\nI knelt behind her, unzipped my pants, and fished my cock out.\nI pushed the head of my penis into the glistening pink flesh of her vagina.\nMy head looked huge–enormous–against the tiny little opening of the child’s vagina. The entirety of her smooth slit was completely hidden underneath my cockhead; I could feel her wetness, but only against the very tip of my cock, which was all that I dared to press into her. I did not intend to go in any further for fear of hurting her; I only wanted to just touch her wet girlhood with my cockhead while I masturbated.\nBut as I began to masturbate I almost involuntarily began moving my hips back and forth, and she did the same, lifting her bottom even higher, and within a minute my head was half-way inside her soft wet lips; as I masturbated I pulled back, then pushed in, her nine year old pussy giving the top half of my head sweet little kisses.\n“Cindy,” I said quietly, “I want to put it a little bit further in you, is that OK?”\nThe little bunny-rabbit looked back at me and nodded. “Yes,” she said quietly in her childish little high-pitched voice.\nI gripped my cock and pulled back and pushed in.\nThe little bunny-rabbit’s back arched further and she winced and let out a high little sound, “Ahhh!”\nThe entirety of my head was now inside the little bunny-rabbit, her tiny little nine year old pussy stretched wide around it. I pulled back. My head was covered in blood from the poor little girl’s ruptured hymen.\nI grabbed some kleenix and wiped the blood off my penis, then wiped the blood from her vagina as well. Then I pushed my head back into her.\nThe little bunny-rabbit’s body tensed as I entered her, and she winced again. But I went no further; I simply pushed my head into her, then pulled back and pushed my head in again, letting her tiny little nine year old pussy give me head.\nI wrapped my hand around my cock and began masturbating while her little pussy gave me head. It was unbelievable how tiny she was; my head had to squeeze into her little hole each time he pushed in. But she was warm, and wet, and within a minute my orgasm started.\n“Oh, Cindy! Oh, sweetie! I’m gonna come!”\nThe little bunny-rabbit looked back at me and twitched her little pink nose.\nIt was the most amazing ejaculation I have ever had. A huge stream of semen fired out of my cock and into the little bunny-rabbit’s newly deflowered nine year old pussy.\n“Oh, Cindy! Take my come! Take my sperm!”\nWhen I’d finished orgasming, I pulled out of her and she collapsed onto her side. I lay down next to her and leaned in to kiss her and she opened her mouth wide. Then we lay there, taking turns exploring each other’s mouths with our tongues.\nAs we kissed, I lifted my hands to her chest and began gently touching her nipples. She lifted her hands to my nipples and began touching them through my shirt; I quickly pulled my shirt off and she began running her fingers through my chest hair, then down to my belly.\nWhen her fingers got low on my belly, I unbuttoned my pants and pulled them down. I was already at half-mast again. She moved her hand down further and touched my penis.\n“Cindy, do you think I could put him inside you again?”\nThe little bunny-rabbit looked at me and nodded. “Yes,” she said quietly in her childish little high-pitched voice.\nI gently pushed her onto her back and climbed on top of her. I pushed my head into her tiny little nine year old vagina. She was still quite sloppy from our earlier love-making and I entered her rather easily, even though her hole was so very tiny and my head so very, very large. I was, nonetheless, able to push into her a bit further this time, most of my head now venturing past the remnants of her hymen and into her tiny vaginal canal. This was all the further I was willing to go, though. I was honestly afraid that I was going to tear the little girl apart.\nI pulled back and pushed in, my head passing through her hymenal ring; back, then in; back, then in. “Oh, Cindy, oh, my little bunny-rabbit!”\nShe smiled up at me and twitched her little pink nose.\n“Oh, Cindy, I love you!” I shouted as my come flowed out of me and into her little nine-year-old body again.\n“I love you too!” she shouted back in her childish little high-pitched voice.\nWhen I finished, I left my penis inside her and we held each other tightly. “Cindy,” I whispered in her ear, “you are the sweetest, most wonderful, beautiful thing in the world.”\nThe little bunny-rabbit smiled and twitched her little pink nose.\n",

      The Little Bunny-Rabbit
    </h1>
    <div class="post-description">
      A story of a neighbor girl who pretends to be a bunny-rabbit, and the man who fancies to her. This is the fourth story in my &#39;little animal&#39; series, which began with &#39;The Little Kitty-Cat,&#39; then &#39;The Little Puppy-Dog&#39; and &#39;The Little Monkey.&#39; As with all the stories, this story can be read by itself or you can work your way from the beginning to get a better idea of the progression of their relationship.

  <div class="post-content"><p>The little bunny-rabbit sat on her back legs, her front paws held up to her chest. She twitched her little pink nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty little bunny-rabbit,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Can I pet you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, her furry white ears with pink insides nodding along.</p>
<p>On the television, the narrator&rsquo;s voice intoned: &ldquo;The Eastern Cottontail&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit leaned forward, lifting her bottom in the air to show me her little cottontail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;mates promiscuously&hellip;&rdquo; the narrator continued.</p>
<p>I put my hand on her head and petted her hair. &ldquo;What a sweet little cottontail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the females having sometimes five or more mates during one brooding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit sat back on her hind legs again, lifting her front paws to her chest, and watched the TV. On screen, one rabbit was crouched on her belly on the ground, her back arched and her bottom in the air, while another mounted her. The male made several rapid movements with his hips and about two seconds later the female jumped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Female rabbits do not enter heat, but instead ovulate in response to mating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The male hopped forward to the female and mounted her again, pumping his hips.</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit looked at me and wrinkled her nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Female cottontails can have three or more broods a year, with between five and eight kits, and are usually ready to mate again shortly after giving birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit looked up at me, sitting on her hind legs, and twitched her nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because of this promiscuity and nearly constant mating,&rdquo; the narrator continued, &ldquo;that the rabbit has become a symbol of sexuality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit and I both looked at the television screen, which was showing a naked woman wearing bunny ears, her breasts and pubic region blurred.</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit looked back at me and twitched her little pink nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is also the reason that rabbits are a nuisance in some agricultural areas&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I grabbed the remote and clicked the television off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a symbol of sexuality, little bunny?&rdquo; I asked her.</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit looked at me for a moment. She bit her lower lip, then gave a tiny little nod. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she said quietly in her childish little high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over here, bunny,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit slowly walked over to where I was sitting on the couch.</p>
<p>I reached out and took hold of her shirt. &ldquo;Bunnies usually don&rsquo;t wear clothes, do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit looked at me for a moment, then gave a tiny shake of her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said quietly in her childish little high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>I lifted her shirt up. She raised her arms in the air so I could pull it off. Her bunny ears fell off. I picked them up and handed them to her and she put them back on.</p>
<p>I looked at the little bunny-rabbit&rsquo;s bare chest in front of me, so pale, so small. She had no breasts at all; her nipples were fairly wide, but unerupted, flat against her skinny chest.</p>
<p>Her nipples were as light pink as apple blossoms, as soft as powderpuffs, as delicate as wildflowers.</p>
<p>I leaned in and nuzzled into the little bunny-rabbit&rsquo;s belly as I took hold of the waistband of her shorts and pulled them down.</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit&rsquo;s shorts and panties fell to her feet.</p>
<p>I kissed her belly. Then I sat back and looked at her naked little nine-year-old pussy, smooth and white, her pubic mound rising provocative from her belly, little pale lips disappearing between her legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lost your cottontail,&rdquo; I said. The tail was stuck to her shorts with a bit of tape; I pulled the tail off her shorts and the little bunny-rabbit turned around so that her skinny little nine year old girlish bottom was facing me.</p>
<p>I stuck the tail to her naked bottom, then I moved my finger down from the tail, down her bottom. I pushed it between her thighs until I was touching the girl&rsquo;s little nine year old pussy. I pushed a finger into her, just a little. She was warm, and wet.</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit took a step away from me, then got down on her knees. She crouched and leaned down, her belly on the ground, her back arched and her bottom in the air. She looked up at me. Her face was red and she had a serious, and perhaps a bit concerned, look. But she twitched her little pink nose.</p>
<p>I knelt behind her, unzipped my pants, and fished my cock out.</p>
<p>I pushed the head of my penis into the glistening pink flesh of her vagina.</p>
<p>My head looked huge&ndash;enormous&ndash;against the tiny little opening of the child&rsquo;s vagina. The entirety of her smooth slit was completely hidden underneath my cockhead; I could feel her wetness, but only against the very tip of my cock, which was all that I dared to press into her. I did not intend to go in any further for fear of hurting her; I only wanted to just touch her wet girlhood with my cockhead while I masturbated.</p>
<p>But as I began to masturbate I almost involuntarily began moving my hips back and forth, and she did the same, lifting her bottom even higher, and within a minute my head was half-way inside her soft wet lips; as I masturbated I pulled back, then pushed in, her nine year old pussy giving the top half of my head sweet little kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cindy,&rdquo; I said quietly, &ldquo;I want to put it a little bit further in you, is that OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit looked back at me and nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said quietly in her childish little high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>I gripped my cock and pulled back and pushed in.</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit&rsquo;s back arched further and she winced and let out a high little sound, &ldquo;Ahhh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entirety of my head was now inside the little bunny-rabbit, her tiny little nine year old pussy stretched wide around it. I pulled back. My head was covered in blood from the poor little girl&rsquo;s ruptured hymen.</p>
<p>I grabbed some kleenix and wiped the blood off my penis, then wiped the blood from her vagina as well. Then I pushed my head back into her.</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit&rsquo;s body tensed as I entered her, and she winced again. But I went no further; I simply pushed my head into her, then pulled back and pushed my head in again, letting her tiny little nine year old pussy give me head.</p>
<p>I wrapped my hand around my cock and began masturbating while her little pussy gave me head. It was unbelievable how tiny she was; my head had to squeeze into her little hole each time he pushed in. But she was warm, and wet, and within a minute my orgasm started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cindy! Oh, sweetie! I&rsquo;m gonna come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit looked back at me and twitched her little pink nose.</p>
<p>It was the most amazing ejaculation I have ever had. A huge stream of semen fired out of my cock and into the little bunny-rabbit&rsquo;s newly deflowered nine year old pussy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cindy! Take my come! Take my sperm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;d finished orgasming, I pulled out of her and she collapsed onto her side. I lay down next to her and leaned in to kiss her and she opened her mouth wide. Then we lay there, taking turns exploring each other&rsquo;s mouths with our tongues.</p>
<p>As we kissed, I lifted my hands to her chest and began gently touching her nipples. She lifted her hands to my nipples and began touching them through my shirt; I quickly pulled my shirt off and she began running her fingers through my chest hair, then down to my belly.</p>
<p>When her fingers got low on my belly, I unbuttoned my pants and pulled them down. I was already at half-mast again. She moved her hand down further and touched my penis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cindy, do you think I could put him inside you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit looked at me and nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said quietly in her childish little high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>I gently pushed her onto her back and climbed on top of her. I pushed my head into her tiny little nine year old vagina. She was still quite sloppy from our earlier love-making and I entered her rather easily, even though her hole was so very tiny and my head so very, very large. I was, nonetheless, able to push into her a bit further this time, most of my head now venturing past the remnants of her hymen and into her tiny vaginal canal. This was all the further I was willing to go, though. I was honestly afraid that I was going to tear the little girl apart.</p>
<p>I pulled back and pushed in, my head passing through her hymenal ring; back, then in; back, then in. &ldquo;Oh, Cindy, oh, my little bunny-rabbit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled up at me and twitched her little pink nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cindy, I love you!&rdquo; I shouted as my come flowed out of me and into her little nine-year-old body again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you too!&rdquo; she shouted back in her childish little high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>When I finished, I left my penis inside her and we held each other tightly. &ldquo;Cindy,&rdquo; I whispered in her ear, &ldquo;you are the sweetest, most wonderful, beautiful thing in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bunny-rabbit smiled and twitched her little pink nose.</p>
