  "articleBody": "I was 15 when the couple moved in next door. They had two kids, both boys - two and a half year old Justin, and an infant named David. While I’ve had an attraction to kids for as long as I can really remember, I’ve never been attracted to one so young - maybe it was desperation that made him look so cute to me. His pale complexion and curly red hair didn’t hurt any either. A real turn on for me was when he was out in his yard one day, wearing nothing but the old fashioned training pants - you know what I mean, those thick cloth ones.\nI have no idea what Justin did wrong, but his dad pulled the tyke to him, pulled the back of his training pants down and gave Justin a few swats on his bare butt. Wow! I instantly grew hard in my pants. Soon after, I had started trying to come up with ideas on how I could safely get him for myself - but every idea I had was too risky.\nI finally got an opportunity when I was asked to babysit Justin for a little while so his parents could go shopping with mine. Of course, I was all for it. I can still see him in his green jeans and matching long sleeved shirt. I’m not sure why, but he was wearing a diaper that particular day. He had been there for some time when I thought it time to change his diaper. I got a warm, wet washcloth and a clean diaper, then took him to my bedroom.\nLaying him on the bed, I unfastened and pulled down his little jeans. Then undid the diaper and took it off him. After gently, and thoroughly, washing his cute little pecker, tiny nutsack and butt, I started playing with him. With two fingers I stroked his tiny dick before finally leaning down and taking him into my mouth to suck it.\nAs I tried sucking him to erection, he laid there whining. I just ignored him as I continued stroking and sucking on his tiny appendage. In my mind I was thinking about taking it further when I thought I heard car doors slam. That put an end to it - I quickly diapered him, pulled his jeans up and fastened them. It turned out to be a false alarm. But I needed some relief, so I went back to my room and laid on my bed jacking off. As I neared release, I called my little charge to come to me.\nHe stood next to my bed, watching as one oy my hands moved up and down my shaft. The other one made its way down into the back of his jeans and diaper, fondling his small globes. Justin had started whining, but I ignored it as I continued stroking my dick while feeling his little butt - until I came on my stomach.\nI finally got another chance one warm summer day. His mom needed to go downtown and wanted to know if I could watch both of them. They were supposedly napping. Of course, I could help her out (and myself, too.) I had already decided I was going to get me some - but I was thinking of doing it with David this time. Until I walked into the bedroom and saw Justin laying there on his side on the bed, wearing only his training pants, the little curve of his small butt calling out to me.\nWithout much thought to it, I sat on the edge of the bed. Pulling the back of his trainers down to expose his little pale white butt, I caressed the bare skin of the toddler’s butt cheeks momentarily before rolling him onto his back to pull the front of them down. Pushing him onto his back, his eyes opened. His whining started as, in one fluid motion, I pulled the front down, then slid them all the way down his legs and pulled them off him. Justin continued to whine as I played with his little dick.\n“Stop whining”, I told him as my fingers stroked him. “This is going to happen, whether you want it to or not.” I spent only a few minutes alternately jacking him off and sucking him. My own cock was so hard it was hurting.\nAs the naked two and a half year old lay there whining on the bed, I looked around for something to use as lube (don’t know why I didn’t think to bring the vaseline with me). Spotting a tube of night cream on the dresser, I was hoping it would work. I rolled Justin onto his side. Squirting a glob of the cream onto my fingers, I spread his cheeks and lubed his hole. Then, laying on the bed behind him, I pulled my shorts and underwear down to my thighs and smeared some of the cream on my six inch erection.\nRolling onto my side behind him, I put one arm under his neck - so my forearm went down his chest and belly, with my hand against his naked pelvis - my other hand guiding my dick into the crack between his little buttcheeks. He continued whining as I held him there, sliding the tip of my dick in his slippery crack, telling him in a soft voice, “Lay still and relax.”\nHe was laying still, whining the entire time. Placing the tip to his rear opening, I gently pressed against his hole. As I felt the tip slide in, Justin screamed and pulled - but he couldn’t get away as I held him there and slid my entire length deep into his toddler butt. I remember being surprised at how easy it was to get into him. I held the screaming, naked little boy in place as I started pumping in and out of his little butt - his hot hole tightly holding onto my teenage fuck stick. In and out I pumped, gently sliding the full length of my tool in and out of Justin’s little butt.\nI guess I had loosened my hold on him because, somehow, my dick had come out of him. Justin rolled forward a little - I helped him onto his belly with a little push. Then my hand came down on his bare butt - SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! I gave his bare butt three good smacks that turned his buttcheeks a light pink - causing him to scream out again.\nRolling him back onto his side and getting a better hold on his small body, I lined my dick back up to his hole - and pushed all of it back into Justin. His screams intensified as I slid deep into his hot little butthole again. This time I held him tighter, pinning the two and a half year old in place as I fucked him in his butt. Nearing orgasm, I started pumping my hips a little faster against his bare little butt - until I couldn’t hold back any longer. Jet after jet of my teenage cum filled his toddler butthole. After pumping a few more times to drain every drop into him, I slowly pulled out.\nAs his noises quieted, I wiped my dick clean and pulled my pants up. Then, after wiping his little butt clean a few times, I put his training pants back on him. I’d have liked to have done it again, but I knew there wasn’t time. I’d just have to wait for the next opportunity.\nComments welcomed. Should I continue, or make this my only one???\n",
