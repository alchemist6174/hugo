  "articleBody": "It has been a month since I was introduced to McKenzie. McKenzie has been in my bed every weekend since as well as my niece.\nMichayla says to me, “Uncle Ted do you still love me?”\nI say “yes very much sweetheart, more than life itself.”\nShe says, “I love you that much too.”\nMcKenzie leaves and goes home on Sunday as usual. On Monday I get a phone call from her mother saying we need to talk.\nI say “come over after work this afternoon.”\nI wonder what she needs to talk to me about. Many questions run through my mind. Is McKenzie pregnant? Did McKenzie tell her mother about us having sex?, etc.\nI am now anxious do I pack up and move to a different state? Well whatever it is I will find out in just a few hours. Meanwhile I am sweating bullets.\nMichayla comes over and asks, “what is wrong Uncle Ted?'\nI say, “McKenzie’s mom says we need to talk.” Michayla just starts laughing.\nI say to her “what are you laughing at?”\nShe says, “you worry too much Uncle.”\nI say, “I am worried about losing you.”\nShe says “that will never happen.”\nShe reaches down and grabs my hand, and then she kisses me on the lips. Michayla smiles at me and tells me not to worry. The afternoon passes quickly and soon it is time for McKenzie’s mother to arrive.\nMcKenzie’s mother arrives as scheduled. McKenzie gives me her heartwarming smile and I smile back.\nMcKenzie says, “Ted this is my mom, Sue.”\nI say, “pleased to meet you Sue, come in and have a seat.\nI say to the girls, “why don’t you two go upstairs and play while I talk to Sue.\nMichayla says, “oh do we have too?”\nI say, “yes.”\nMichayla and McKenzie run upstairs to play.\nI turn to Sue and say, “what exactly did you need to talk to me about?”\nSue says, “my McKenzie is pregnant and she refuses to say who she had sex with.”\n“So what are you getting at here, Sue?”\nHer mother says “I want to know if it happened while she was here with you.”\nI say, “not to my knowledge.”\nSue says “I am not going to press charges because my husband has been dead for three years and I can’t conceive so I am elated by this.”\n“I think McKenzie is scared to tell anyone about her being pregnant, because of the consequences to her lover.”\nSue says, “is that what you are?”\n“How did you figure it out?” I ask.\nShe says “because McKenzie told me about your relationship with your niece and I sent her here to be impregnated by you.” Sue further states that I know you and your niece are going to get married, but I want McKenzie to be with you in an open relationship.\n“You will need to discuss this with my niece,” I reply.\nSue states that this will have to happen for her silence.\n“Now you are resorting to extortion Sue.”\nSue states “I’m even a midwife so you won’t need a doctor when they both go into labor.”\n“Both?” I ask.\nShe laughs and then says “that’s right Ted you have knocked up both girls and the choice is yours you can be with them in an open relationship or spend it prison.”\n“So what’s in it for you Sue?”\nSue responds by saying “I want us to move in with you and Michayla, you can share your bed with both girls, I just ask that you make love to me every once in a while.” She goes on to say “you will have my help with both newborns and the girls.”\n“When are you two going to move in?” I ask.\n“This weekend,” Sue replies Sue gets up and calls for McKenzie and prepares to leave.\nAs they are leaving Michayla says, “is everything ok, Uncle?”\n“I think so darling, we are getting roommates.” “I hope you don’t mind sharing me,” I say.\n“If it keeps us together, then I will,” My niece says.\n“I will only love you no matter how many times I make love to McKenzie,” is my reply. Michayla just giggles.\n“So my darling niece, what’s this I hear you are pregnant?” I ask. She looks at me with a shocked look on her face. I just smile.\n“Who told you that I was pregnant?” She asks.\n“Didn’t McKenzie’s mother administer a pregnancy test on you?” I ask.\n“Yes, but she did not tell me the results.”\n“Well she told me.”\n“So I am going to have a baby like McKenzie?”\n“Yes my sweet niece, you are.”\n“Goodie,” she says.\n“I am in so much trouble,” I say. Michayla just looks at me and smiles.\n“I love you so much Uncle.”\n“I love you too,” I reply.\n“Let’s go to bed and make love since I can’t get pregnant now.”\nWe both retire to the bedroom and make passionate love. We are laying there in the afterglow of sex and the phone rings. It is Sue telling me that they will be there later that night with their belongings. I just tell them to take their time. As the evening comes upon us our new roommates arrive. Michayla and I are making love when McKenzie says, “hey no fair I want your sperm too.”\nI just pat the bed and McKenzie comes running and jumps in the bed beside me and strips down to nothing. It is not long before McKenzie is being pleasured and she lets out a scream as she has her first orgasm of the evening and I unload my fertile sperm into her.\nSue comes by the bedroom and says, “save some for me.” Later that night the kids are sleeping, Sue and I just talk about this and that.\n“I know you are going to marry your niece and I know you love McKenzie as well,” sue says. “So how are you going to pull this off?” she asks.\n“I don’t know, I haven’t really thought about it,” I reply.\nSue comes over and sits by me and starts stroking my cock through my shorts. She says “I know you are a pedophile, but will I do for a night cap?” Sue asks.\nI kiss her passionately and she returns the kiss. It is not long before Sue is moaning into my mouth and we retire to the bedroom. We make love to each other most of the night. After Sue goes to her room McKenzie screams out in her sleep. I rush into her room to what’s wrong with her. She is crying and upset. I ask her what is wrong and she said she had a nightmare about going to school now that she was pregnant. I told her not to worry because we already had the solution to her problem.\nWe enroll both girls in an online school the next morning.\nSue leaves and goes to work and I stay home with both girls. We continue on like this for two months. I wake up one morning to Sue throwing up and I think nothing of it. The next morning Sue is sick again, she leaves for work and then comes home. Sue calls for all of us to come to the living room and to sit down she has something to tell us.\n“I’m pregnant,” Sue says.\n“But I thought you said you could not get pregnant,” comes my response. “When are you due?’ I ask.\n“Two months after the girls,” says Sue.\nNow I think to myself I am in a real world of hurt as I have three pregnant females living under the same roof. I am not going to be able to handle their mood swings and hormonal changes for nine months.\nDuring their nine months of pregnancy we made love many times, however; poor Sue felt left out. She is not my type and she had to call either one of the girls into the room and tell them to get undressed just so I could have an erection. This was frustrating to her, but pleasure for me. Both girls had girls and Sue had a baby boy. Both of the girls want to start raising their daughters on sperm, so they will be used to it when their father wants to have sex with them when they become older.\nMichayla and I married just after her fifteenth birthday and McKenzie lives with us. Sue took my son and moved out, but true to her word she never turned me in. I now enjoy my wife, her best friend and all four of my daughters. I hope to impregnate the two older ones tonight. I also have three sons by both of these nymphs.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>It has been a month since I was introduced to McKenzie. McKenzie has been in my bed every weekend since as well as my niece.</p>
<p>Michayla says to me, &ldquo;Uncle Ted do you still love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say &ldquo;yes very much sweetheart, more than life itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I say, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michayla and McKenzie run upstairs to play.</p>
<p>I turn to Sue and say, &ldquo;what exactly did you need to talk to me about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sue says, &ldquo;my McKenzie is pregnant and she refuses to say who she had sex with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what are you getting at here, Sue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother says &ldquo;I want to know if it happened while she was here with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say, &ldquo;not to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sue says &ldquo;I am not going to press charges because my husband has been dead for three years and I can&rsquo;t conceive so I am elated by this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think McKenzie is scared to tell anyone about her being pregnant, because of the consequences to her lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sue says, &ldquo;is that what you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you figure it out?&rdquo; I ask.</p>
<p>She says &ldquo;because McKenzie told me about your relationship with your niece and I sent her here to be impregnated by you.&rdquo; Sue further states that I know you and your niece are going to get married, but I want McKenzie to be with you in an open relationship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will need to discuss this with my niece,&rdquo; I reply.</p>
<p>Sue states that this will have to happen for her silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you are resorting to extortion Sue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sue states &ldquo;I&rsquo;m even a midwife so you won&rsquo;t need a doctor when they both go into labor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both?&rdquo; I ask.</p>
<p>She laughs and then says &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right Ted you have knocked up both girls and the choice is yours you can be with them in an open relationship or spend it prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s in it for you Sue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sue responds by saying &ldquo;I want us to move in with you and Michayla, you can share your bed with both girls, I just ask that you make love to me every once in a while.&rdquo; She goes on to say &ldquo;you will have my help with both newborns and the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you two going to move in?&rdquo; I ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This weekend,&rdquo; Sue replies Sue gets up and calls for McKenzie and prepares to leave.</p>
<p>As they are leaving Michayla says, &ldquo;is everything ok, Uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so darling, we are getting roommates.&rdquo; &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind sharing me,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it keeps us together, then I will,&rdquo; My niece says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will only love you no matter how many times I make love to McKenzie,&rdquo; is my reply. Michayla just giggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So my darling niece, what&rsquo;s this I hear you are pregnant?&rdquo; I ask. She looks at me with a shocked look on her face. I just smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t McKenzie&rsquo;s mother administer a pregnancy test on you?&rdquo; I ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she did not tell me the results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well she told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am going to have a baby like McKenzie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes my sweet niece, you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodie,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in so much trouble,&rdquo; I say. Michayla just looks at me and smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you so much Uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; I reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to bed and make love since I can&rsquo;t get pregnant now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sue leaves and goes to work and I stay home with both girls. We continue on like this for two months. I wake up one morning to Sue throwing up and I think nothing of it. The next morning Sue is sick again, she leaves for work and then comes home. Sue calls for all of us to come to the living room and to sit down she has something to tell us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pregnant,&rdquo; Sue says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you said you could not get pregnant,&rdquo; comes my response. &ldquo;When are you due?&rsquo; I ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two months after the girls,&rdquo; says Sue.</p>
<p>Now I think to myself I am in a real world of hurt as I have three pregnant females living under the same roof. I am not going to be able to handle their mood swings and hormonal changes for nine months.</p>
<p>During their nine months of pregnancy we made love many times, however; poor Sue felt left out. She is not my type and she had to call either one of the girls into the room and tell them to get undressed just so I could have an erection. This was frustrating to her, but pleasure for me. Both girls had girls and Sue had a baby boy. Both of the girls want to start raising their daughters on sperm, so they will be used to it when their father wants to have sex with them when they become older.</p>
<p>Michayla and I married just after her fifteenth birthday and McKenzie lives with us. Sue took my son and moved out, but true to her word she never turned me in. I now enjoy my wife, her best friend and all four of my daughters. I hope to impregnate the two older ones tonight. I also have three sons by both of these nymphs.</p>
