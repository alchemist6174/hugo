Dan and Michelle were a little alarmed at first to come home after midnight and find an unknown adolescent girl in the house - anyone would think Dan bloody lived there - but they soon relaxed when it was evident the situation was under control. Under Simon’s control, basically, and it was soon obvious that Fiona was precisely that. Even when he was nowhere near her, it was like there was a invisible cord between the 37-year-old’s wrist and hers, and she was ‘his bitch’ so to speak. She’d have been a spaniel, for those with caricature -drawing talent, and midway between puppy and adulthood. Her brown hair dangled down over her shoulders just like a springer’s ears, and she had the same docile round eyes. Sean could tell by the way she looked at him that she’d been told how friendly they were going to be tonight.\nHannah was allowed to stay downstairs with them all for a while, curious by the new female in her midst, before being shooed off to the master bedroom and told she could go to sleep if she wanted. Dan and Michelle - now lovers, and Sean didn’t mind one bit - would join her in the bed. Hannah was well at ease with this, as it was nothing new and also meant she was safe from being jumped by any other pedo during the dead of night. Sean had done this a few times, getting under the covers for a quick bum-grind on the half-asleep child. Worst, though, was when Simon once did it, bringing her downstairs at 3am to be facialled and mouth-fucked by he and a buddy he had brought on a one-off visit. He wouldn’t dare do it again, especially with Dan around. Tonight she could get a good rest, so long as she could sleep through Dan and her mother’s love-making. Simon didn’t seem to mind not getting his hands on the 10-year-old tonight, and he took a 20-minute walk with Sean to the Open-all-hours, whilst Fiona was told to make herself at home in Hannah’s bedroom. Sean was looking forward to the interesting experience of fucking a 14-year-old in the bedroom of a 10-year-old, almost as if his stepdaughter had aged all of a sudden. Quirky! Meanwhile, he heard the story of how Simon and Fiona had met…\n******\nFiona was just a typical mid-teen, apart from the fact she’d run away: sullen, even when she wasn’t particularly unhappy, but inclined to air-headed chatter at any moment once she’d got over her shyness with a new person. It was easy to read between the lines that, at home, she’d been argumentative and really quite nasty at times. You could see it in her face and eyes, despite her tranquil manner around the new ‘friends’ in her life. She did not appreciate her parents, particularly her overbearing Dad, and resented her two irksome younger sisters whom she felt were favoured. She hated her school too, and the latest bad report and confrontation with Mom and Dad brought her wanderlust to a head. Simon spotted her at Newcastle station, looking lost on arrival in the big city, and dressed for mobility and comfort rather than fashion. Simon had an eye for these things, and at once realised he might have struck gold in his weeklong ‘scouting’ mission. He introduced himself in a nice professional manner as a youth worker, and manager of a hostel for homeless young people. He even showed her a home-made badge.\nShe was a little cautious at first, but Simon told her to at least let him buy her a drink and snack in one of the station cafes before moving on. She agreed and, by the time they’d finished, she had been persuaded of the ‘good sense ‘of his offer and that the hostel would be just the start she needed in her new life. Fiona was not a stupid girl, relative to the rest of the species, and had already mapped out her destiny in outline. She hoped to get a job in the cafeteria of the Newcastle soccer stadium - as she’d already done a cafe on work-experience - and from there become a girlfriend of one of the star players. She was very pragmatic, and knew she might have to wait 2 years for this to happen, when she became of legal age for sex in Britain. Simon, who already quite liked her by the standard of his many underage fucks, didn’t have the heart to tell her that a rich premiership footballer would not be interested in a ’little miss nobody’ like her. At best, she might be able to get off with one of the apprentices, and Simon told her he actually had contacts with one of them. Indeed, he said he had trialled there once himself. That was quite truthful: he had once trialled for a small amateur side, and got to be in their reserve squad for one season.\nThat very evening, Fiona moved into her new lodgings. A big 3-storey terraced house on the outskirts, with 7 bedrooms, it even looked slightly like a hostel. Her housemates, aside from Simon, included a 46-year-old guy called Dave. He was the pedo who had visited Hannah in the night a few months back, and was only really interested in preteen. There was also a 50-year-old guy, Larry, but he was only into young men or preferably boys. Simon always found gay pedos a bit amusing: well, an arse is an arse, so why the hell couldn’t he enjoy fucking a girl’s arse too? Presumably, the absence of any cock or balls nearby somehow destroyed the concept for him. Also in the house lived two female street whores, 19 and 26, who tended to go about their business and keep themselves to themselves at the top of the house. Simon fucked the younger one - blonde and borderline anorexic - now and then in return for a material favour of some kind. The older was disgusting, not at all a good figure and spotty, and on drugs.\nAfter 2 days of friendship with Fiona, even showing her the football stadium and helping her enquire about a job there, Simon made his move. He started by gently suggesting, in all reasonableness, that she ‘owed him’ for the care he’d shown. Hell, she was being fed for free and had a roof over her head: not only that, he was her mentor in the big wide world. Besides, he liked her and ‘it would mean a lot to him if she liked him’. She said ‘yes of course she did’. ‘Well then’, said Simon, and he went on to suggest they ought to sleep together. Fiona confessed, with creditable honesty and a fair degree of anxiety, that she was a virgin. Sean said not to worry, and that everybody’s time comes and that now was obviously the time for her, with the beginning of her new life and all. Larry joined them and offered his 50-year-old wisdom in the discussion, telling her ‘of course she should’. She agreed, kind of squirming there on the sofa next to Simon, yet she resisted the idea. For all of 2 hours, she resisted. After 3 half pints of lager, his friendly hand on her back, she said a blushful ‘yes, okay’. Her last lame excuse about not being on contraceptives was easily put to bed, so to speak, by the promise to get the morning -after pill.\n******\n“She undressed herself, at same time as me,” said Simon, as he and Sean neared the completion of their walk.\n“Hair? And what were her tits like, naked?”\n“Well, you’ll see, won’t ya?”\n“Fine, you teasing bastard.”\n“Hey, you should be less cheeky. She’s my girlfriend, the love of my life, and I’m sharing her.”\n“Yeah, sure.” Sean chuckled, knowing that Simon had said similar things about previous teens he had fucked. “You’ll be done with her in a month.”\n“Hmm, dunno.”\n“So, tell me at least what’s your favourite part of her?”\n“Face, actually,” said Simon, in a tone that acknowledged it was a rare choice for him .\n“I can see why.” The light hint of freckles enhancing her a pretty and doe-like expression, but with that touch of ‘attitude’. “Probably arse for me, though, from what I’ve seen.”\n“That’s nice too. Had my hands on it a lot that night.”\n“So, you were gentle?”\n“Very, at first. It needed to be romantic. All little kisses and caresses, and go-slow.”\n“Position?”\n“Missionary, after a bit of finger-fucking her on her front.”\n“You’ve done her cunt only?”\n“Yes. You can introduce her to other joys if you wish.”\n“Thanks. She took it okay?”\n“I lubed her up with finger-play for a long time, but even then the entry was tight-tight-tight. She cried slightly, just near the end.”\n“Too rough?”\nSimon shrugged. “A bit. Still slowish, but I went as deep as I could. I suppose the intensity got to her a bit too.”\n“How’s she been since?”\n“Okay, man, okay. I didn’t have much trouble persuading her she should give one for my friend too.”\n“That’s good.”\n“I even told her you were a good-looking son-of-a-bitch. Gotto bend the truth a bit.”\n“Fuck off. She does think I’m good-looking and she likes me, I can tell.”\nThe two laughed, just outside Sean’s front door. “Not as much as me!” said Simon.\n“Course not, you’re her first.”\n“Hope Hannah doesn’t get jealous of you two tonight,” said Simon.\n“Ha, I doubt it. Dan is her man now.”\n“Oh yeah, gentle teacher man. Don’t suppose he’d let me…”\n“No. Forget it.”\n“Drat,” said Simon, but clearly not too fussed.\n“You can probably come round Monday,” said Sean. “We’ll have her between just the two of us then.”\n“Nice. I’ve missed her gorgeous little bum.”\n“She’s due for a spit-roast that she didn’t get this evening.”\n“Ahh, there we go then,” said Simon.\n“You up her little shitter and me in her mouth: perfect.”\n“Yup. Well, enjoy yourself with my girlfriend, won’t you?”\n“I believe I will.”\n“I’ll come and get her in the morning. Midday at the latest, that okay?”\n“Make it midday.” Sean wondered what Fiona would be like on a ‘morning after’, with a man she had only just met. Besides, he almost always had waking-up hardness and would probably want to give her one mid-morning.\nSimon laughed. “I’ll see what I can do. Firm but gentle, remember, and you’ll be onto a winner. Tell me if her arse smells of roses. I haven’t been there yet.”\n“You’re slacking, man.”\n“Ah, piss off. Have a good time. See ya!”\nSimon walked off into the night, with a last wave. Sean went into his house, wondering how he might best enjoy the body of this 14-year-old girlie guest throughout the night.\nThe End\nAny thoughts creative, erotic, philosophical, moral are welcome in email. Would be particularly interesting, in view of proceedings, to hear about age-preferences and reasons for them.\n",

Fiona was not a stupid girl, relative to the rest of the species, and had already mapped out her destiny in outline. She hoped to get a job in the cafeteria of the Newcastle soccer stadium - as she&rsquo;d already done a cafe on work-experience - and from there become a girlfriend of one of the star players. She was very pragmatic, and knew she might have to wait 2 years for this to happen, when she became of legal age for sex in Britain. Simon, who already quite liked her by the standard of his many underage fucks, didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell her that a rich premiership footballer would not be interested in a &rsquo;little miss nobody&rsquo; like her. At best, she might be able to get off with one of the apprentices, and Simon told her he actually had contacts with one of them. Indeed, he said he had trialled there once himself. That was quite truthful: he had once trialled for a small amateur side, and got to be in their reserve squad for one season.</p>
<p>That very evening, Fiona moved into her new lodgings. A big 3-storey terraced house on the outskirts, with 7 bedrooms, it even looked slightly like a hostel. Her housemates, aside from Simon, included a 46-year-old guy called Dave. He was the pedo who had visited Hannah in the night a few months back, and was only really interested in preteen. There was also a 50-year-old guy, Larry, but he was only into young men or preferably boys. Simon always found gay pedos a bit amusing: well, an arse is an arse, so why the hell couldn&rsquo;t he enjoy fucking a girl&rsquo;s arse too? Presumably, the absence of any cock or balls nearby somehow destroyed the concept for him. Also in the house lived two female street whores, 19 and 26, who tended to go about their business and keep themselves to themselves at the top of the house. Simon fucked the younger one - blonde and borderline anorexic - now and then in return for a material favour of some kind. The older was disgusting, not at all a good figure and spotty, and on drugs.</p>
<p>After 2 days of friendship with Fiona, even showing her the football stadium and helping her enquire about a job there, Simon made his move. He started by gently suggesting, in all reasonableness, that she &lsquo;owed him&rsquo; for the care he&rsquo;d shown. Hell, she was being fed for free and had a roof over her head: not only that, he was her mentor in the big wide world. Besides, he liked her and &lsquo;it would mean a lot to him if she liked him&rsquo;. She said &lsquo;yes of course she did&rsquo;. &lsquo;Well then&rsquo;, said Simon, and he went on to suggest they ought to sleep together. Fiona confessed, with creditable honesty and a fair degree of anxiety, that she was a virgin. Sean said not to worry, and that everybody&rsquo;s time comes and that now was obviously the time for her, with the beginning of her new life and all. Larry joined them and offered his 50-year-old wisdom in the discussion, telling her &lsquo;of course she should&rsquo;. She agreed, kind of squirming there on the sofa next to Simon, yet she resisted the idea. For all of 2 hours, she resisted. After 3 half pints of lager, his friendly hand on her back, she said a blushful &lsquo;yes, okay&rsquo;. Her last lame excuse about not being on contraceptives was easily put to bed, so to speak, by the promise to get the morning -after pill.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>&ldquo;She undressed herself, at same time as me,&rdquo; said Simon, as he and Sean neared the completion of their walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hair? And what were her tits like, naked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll see, won&rsquo;t ya?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, you teasing bastard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you should be less cheeky. She&rsquo;s my girlfriend, the love of my life, and I&rsquo;m sharing her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure.&rdquo; Sean chuckled, knowing that Simon had said similar things about previous teens he had fucked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be done with her in a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm, dunno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, tell me at least what&rsquo;s your favourite part of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Face, actually,&rdquo; said Simon, in a tone that acknowledged it was a rare choice for him .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see why.&rdquo; The light hint of freckles enhancing her a pretty and doe-like expression, but with that touch of &lsquo;attitude&rsquo;. &ldquo;Probably arse for me, though, from what I&rsquo;ve seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice too. Had my hands on it a lot that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you were gentle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very, at first. It needed to be romantic. All little kisses and caresses, and go-slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Position?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missionary, after a bit of finger-fucking her on her front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done her cunt only?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You can introduce her to other joys if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. She took it okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lubed her up with finger-play for a long time, but even then the entry was tight-tight-tight. She cried slightly, just near the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too rough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simon shrugged. &ldquo;A bit. Still slowish, but I went as deep as I could. I suppose the intensity got to her a bit too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s she been since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, man, okay. I didn&rsquo;t have much trouble persuading her she should give one for my friend too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I even told her you were a good-looking son-of-a-bitch. Gotto bend the truth a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck off. She does think I&rsquo;m good-looking and she likes me, I can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two laughed, just outside Sean&rsquo;s front door. &ldquo;Not as much as me!&rdquo; said Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course not, you&rsquo;re her first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope Hannah doesn&rsquo;t get jealous of you two tonight,&rdquo; said Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, I doubt it. Dan is her man now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, gentle teacher man. Don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;d let me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drat,&rdquo; said Simon, but clearly not too fussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can probably come round Monday,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have her between just the two of us then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice. I&rsquo;ve missed her gorgeous little bum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s due for a spit-roast that she didn&rsquo;t get this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh, there we go then,&rdquo; said Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You up her little shitter and me in her mouth: perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup. Well, enjoy yourself with my girlfriend, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come and get her in the morning. Midday at the latest, that okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it midday.&rdquo; Sean wondered what Fiona would be like on a &lsquo;morning after&rsquo;, with a man she had only just met. Besides, he almost always had waking-up hardness and would probably want to give her one mid-morning.</p>
<p>Simon laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do. Firm but gentle, remember, and you&rsquo;ll be onto a winner. Tell me if her arse smells of roses. I haven&rsquo;t been there yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re slacking, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, piss off. Have a good time. See ya!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simon walked off into the night, with a last wave. Sean went into his house, wondering how he might best enjoy the body of this 14-year-old girlie guest throughout the night.</p>
<p>The End</p>
