  "articleBody": "It was nearly eight when I woke up the next morning. Robyn and I had fallen asleep in each other’s arms on top of the covers, so I was freezing. I glanced over and noticed the door to her room was wide open. Jesus. I hope Mom and Dad didn’t see us.\nRobyn was still asleep next to me and drooling on my shoulder. I’ve got to pee and my nose was throbbing from where she almost broke it the night before.\nAs I start to get up, she moans and slides her hand down to my morning piss hard on.\n“Hmmm… Daddy…” she mumbles.\nDaddy?? What is she dreaming? I manage to get away. As I do, she smiles and opens her eyes.\nSeeing me, Robyn sits bolt upright in bed looking around madly, “Oh. My. God.” is all she says. After surveying the carnage, her cum stained underwear everywhere, the bloody sheets she was trying to cover herself with, our clothes scattered all over her room, she looks at me and my blood encrusted nose and simply says “Out,” pointing to the door.\nI grab my jeans and shirt from the floor and start to put them on. Instead, she gets up and pushes me out the door, slamming it behind me. I hear Mom downstairs making breakfast, so she must have seen us as she walked down the hall. Oh My God is all I can think, now, too. I grab my robe out of my room and take a shower.\nMy morning hard on is throbbing as I try to take a piss in the shower. It’s no good, so I start to jack off using shampoo. I’m leaning back in the shower, eyes closed, with all of the images and sensations from last night flying thru my head. Robyn’s firm tits rubbing against me, her neatly trimmed bush spread all over my face, her hot mouth sucking my exploding cock. I quickly cum all over the shower and my hard on softens just enough for me to finally piss. My poor cock is so sore for all of hard use last night and in the last week that I have to wash it gently and even the baby shampoo makes it still sting a bit.\nI’m just rinsing off when I hear Robyn come in and take a piss. I shut off the water and wait for her to leave, but she doesn’t. Maybe she’s taking a dump. I don’t want to say anything or piss her off worse, but I am beginning to get cold. Just as I’m about to grab my towel, when she slides the curtain open herself, steps in naked and kisses me.\n“You were wonderful last night,” she whispers, then kisses my sore nose. “Sorry about that, let me make it up to you.” She slides down, rubbing her tits down my chest until she sucks down my entire cock in one gulp. She quickly sucks me hard again.\nIt’s a strange mixture of pleasure and pain. I’ve been jacking off for a week solid, ever since Robyn showed me how, followed by all the sucking and cumming of last night. It both hurts and thrills all at the same time. I’m not about to stop her as she bobs up and down my cock, sucking me deep. She looks up at me and smiles around my cock, but it is really beginning to hurt. The mixture of pleasure and pain begins to make me a little crazy. I grab her head and fuck her face, hard and fast. She looks up at me dismayed, but I don’t care anymore. I just want to cum. I push her against the side of the shower and pound into her. Her teeth are scraping my cock, but I can’t stop, even when she starts to gag and gasp for breath. Finally, with one last deep thrust, I cum down her throat as she starts to cough and choke. I finally release her and she runs out of the bathroom crying and coughing, gasping for air.\nI wash myself clean of all of this, everything that has happened to me in the last week. It’s been great, but really weird too. I mean, she’s my fucking sister!\nMy cock hurts so much it feels like its going to fall off. I wash and dry it tenderly then gently rub some lotion on it. It’s so raw and tired, it doesn’t even get hard. I put on my robe and hear Mom calling us to breakfast.\nMom looks at me when I come into the kitchen and asks, “What happened to you?”\nI’m not sure what she means. She must have seen Robyn and me naked and probably heard her crying just now. Then she leans down and kisses me on the nose, saying “Your poor little nose.” I barely hear what she said because I can see her tits down her loose robe and even all the way down to her bush, too. She didn’t seem to notice, but gives me an odd smile.\n“Oh, Pete and I were wrestling…” I say, referring to my best friend down the street.\n“Mmhmm, you and Pete, huh?” as she finished buttering some toast. She doesn’t ask anything else, and I don’t volunteer anything either.\nAs Mom is dishing up some sausage links and eggs, Robyn traipses in wearing a gauzy negligee. Her tits are clearly visible and her nipples are hard and pointy. She looks at me and gives me a sheepish grin as I gape at her tits. I finally manage to close my mouth and whisper “Sorry, Robyn. I kinda got carried away. Again, I guess. Sorry.”\n“Sorry about what?” Mom asks as she serves Robyn.\n“Nothing.” I mumble and dig into my food.\nI notice Robyn doing something out of the corner of my eye. She’s sucking on a piece of sausage, sucking it in and out of her mouth like it was a little cock. When she see me looking, she bites down on it and chews it up noisily. She laughs at my expression, then begins licking her fingers, slowly.\nMom glares at her, but doesn’t say anything. She just sits eating a piece of toast and sipping her coffee. Her robe has fallen open further, and I can see one of her tits, it still looks pretty nice and no too droopy, almost perky, the nipple pointy and hard. What the fuck is going on around here?\nI’m beginning to get hard again. I try to change the subject. “I noticed the Pontiac is gone. Did Dad go out this morning?”\n“Yes, he left early for the office. He said he had a big report due tomorrow and he’s got to work all day.” Mom notices me noticing her tit. She just smiles and tightens her robe.\nI finish my breakfast as Robyn and I play footsie under the table. She snakes her foot up and rubs my cock with it. I return the favor and toe her moist little crack. We are both almost moaning when I notice Mom squeezing her tit, robe open, as she watches us. Her other hand is hidden under the table but clearly rubbing her own cunt.\nThis is too much for me and I cum under my sister’s foot, grunting with each spurt. My cum sprays up on my chest and Mom lets out a low wail and cums with me. Robyn, not to be left out of this family moment, grabs my foot and cums, too, gushing all over my toes.\nWe’re all breathing hard as we come down to earth. Mom, looking a little sheepish, closes her robe and cleans up the dishes as if this happens at every breakfast. Robyn and I grin at each other and I try to mop up the mess I made. My cum is all over both on top and bottom the table. I look over at Robyn and she is licking my cum off her toes! Yoga is a wonderful thing.\n",
