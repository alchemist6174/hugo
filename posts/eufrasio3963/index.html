  "articleBody": "Little Grace paced back and forth next to the long line of children standing before a large, empty, red-velvet chair. â€œWhere is he?â€ she muttered, studying the crowd for the fifth time, looking for her dad.\nSuddenly, a large red blob, coming around a corner, caught her attention. Thank goodness. She rushed forward to greet her dad who volunteered to wear a Santa costume for a local charity, but immediately stopped when she came closer.\nThat wasnâ€™t her dad. Daddy was over fifty, with a real belly, and warm brown eyes. This man was obviously stuffed - he was listing to one side, and he had sparkling blue eyes. From his gait, she suspected he was a lot younger than fifty.\nâ€œWhereâ€™s my dad?â€ eleven-year-old girl asked when he reached her.\nâ€œHe couldnâ€™t make it today. They need him to finish some paper work, so he asked me to fill in.â€ His gaze traveled down her small body. â€œYouâ€™re Gracie, right?â€\nâ€œGrace,â€ she answered tightly. She glanced nervously at the growing crowd of children and parents. â€œDo you know how to play Santa?â€ Not that it really mattered, she supposed.\nâ€œIâ€™ve bounced a lot of naughty little girls and a few nice ones on my lap. Does that count?â€\nGrace sucked in a large breath and closed her big eyes. She wanted her dad to tell himï¿½again what presents she wanted for Christmas, but this will have to wait now.\nWarm breath teased the skin along her ear. â€œImaging what a good bounce would feel like, Gracie? How old are you?â€\nHer eyes popped open. â€œIâ€™m eleven,â€ she answered disappointedly. This Santa was weird she thought, but she needed a Santa, and a smart mouthed Santa was better than no Santa at all. â€œCan you grant wishes like the real Santa?â€\nHe gave her a little wink. â€œI can grant you any wish, little girl. But I will need you to help me today handing out presents to children.â€\nBefore she could utter a protest, he had turned and started for the red chair, rubbing his fake belly and rumbling â€œho-ho-hoâ€ as he went. This was going to be a long day. Christmas cheer was highly overrated, and hers was quickly being all used up.\nGrace spent the next few hours closely watching her mysterious Santa as she helped to hand out free gifts. Heâ€™d turned out to be quite a marvel with the children, even calming the criers until they laughed with glee and whispered their secrets in his ear.\nBy the time the line of children finally dissipated, Grace was exhausted. She hadnâ€™t taken a break all day. To her Santa still looked as fresh as a daisy.\nWith a strained smile, she stepped over to him. â€œHow did you do it? The children loved you. Every one of them told you what they wanted. Even the ones who screamed, you managed to put a smile on their face.â€\nâ€œI like screamers. They always smile the widest when Iâ€™m through with them.â€ He grinned and patted his lap. â€œWhy donâ€™t you sit here and tell Santa what you want, Gracie. Let me put a smile on your pretty face.â€\nâ€œIs everything related to sex with you?â€ She bent to set down the present she held. â€œAnd my name is Grace.â€\nâ€œI like Gracie. And who said anything about sex? Youâ€™re only a little girl, arenâ€™t you?â€ When she stood, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her down on his lap. â€œTell me your wish, little one. I wonâ€™t biteâ€¦ unless you want me to.â€\nGrace shrieked in a mixture of surprise and outrage, then quickly glanced around, hoping no one had heard her. Sheâ€™d die of embarrassment. Lucky for her, the store looked empty.\nâ€œLet me up. Are you crazy?â€\nâ€œCould be.â€ He chuckled, lacing his fingers through hers.\nAt his touch, little girlâ€™s heart accelerated. He had nice hands. Strong, with long fingers.\nThe overhead lights flickered and then started going out, one by one. Grace automatically looked up.\nâ€œTheyâ€™re closing the place. I didnâ€™t realize it was so late. We have to go.â€\nâ€œNot until you tell me what you want for Christmas. Santa has everything for little girls.â€\nâ€œSounds like youâ€™re a store employee, trying to sell me something. Not all my wishes are toys, you know.â€\nâ€œAh.â€ He smiled. â€œNow weâ€™re getting somewhere.â€\nThe area was suddenly plunged into darkness, and Grace stiffened. She hated the dark with a passion, always had. She even slept with a light on at night just to chase the shadows away.\nâ€œItâ€™s all right,â€ Santa whispered in her ear. â€œYouâ€™re safe with me.â€\nHow did he know? He must have felt the change in her body. She tried to get up, but he wouldnâ€™t release her. Finally, she expelled a heavy breath and settled on his lap.\nâ€œWho are you?â€\nâ€œHmm. White beard, big belly, red suit. I think Iâ€™m Santa Claus.â€\nâ€œNo. I mean really.â€ Little girl peered into his compelling blue eyes, which looked somehow familiar, even though she knew sheâ€™d never met him.\nHe simply shrugged.\nSlowly, Grace reached out and began to peel away his costume. She had to see the real man. She was a little surprised when he didnâ€™t try to stop her.\nThe red hat came off first. Then the white beard and mustache-revealing a strong, square jaw and full lips. The big white wig was next - his natural hair was a light, sandy brown. Geez, he was handsome.\nâ€œWhatâ€™s your name?â€\nâ€œDoes it matter, little Gracie?â€\nShe frowned. Why was he being so mysterious? He must be hiding something.\nâ€œAre you going to let me get up?â€\nâ€œIâ€™m thinking about it.â€ His fingers moved along her slender thigh.\nGrace pulled at her short school skirt, feeling vulnerable. She should have worn pants today, but then, she hadnâ€™t expected to be groped by Santa Claus.\nâ€œYour skin is so soft, Gracie. What are you hiding under there, little girl?â€\nShe slapped his hand. â€œNone of your business!â€\nHe ignored her slap and slid his fingers higher. â€œYou gave everyone a present today. How about a present for Santa?â€\nGraceâ€™s heart thudded in her small chest. â€œWhat exactly did you have in mind?â€\nâ€œWell, since you wonâ€™t whisper your desires in my ear, Iâ€™ll whisper mine in yours.â€\nHis lips slid along her little ear, teasing the sensitive skin there. Grace trembled as a jolt of desire vibrated through her 11-year-old body. Erotic words spoken huskily against her ear caused her blood to heat and her limbs to feel like jello.\nPulling back, he smiled into her blue eyes. â€œCome on, Gracie. Letâ€™s end the year with aâ€¦ bang.â€ He chuckled and pulled her beautiful legs to either side of his lap, so she was straddling him.\nHer school skirt rose up her thighs. Grace gasped at the intimate contact and glanced around. She knew he could see her pink panties.\nâ€œNo oneâ€™s here,â€ he whispered against her temple, as his hands slid down to cup her little bottom.\nShe squirmed, but didnâ€™t try to get away. She liked the feel of his hands on her eleven-year-old body.\nâ€œThis is crazy.â€\nâ€œWhy? And do that again.â€\nâ€œDo what?â€\nâ€œSquirm on my lap.â€\nâ€œGrace!â€ a booming voice called out. â€œIs that you?â€\nGraceâ€™s head snapped toward the sound. â€œOh, no!â€ She pulled against Santa, until he released her, then she jumped off his lap. She started toward her dadâ€™s voice, coming from the other side of a chest-high mound of gifts ready for giveaway in tomorrowâ€™s promotion. â€œYes?â€\nA flashlight illuminated the area just to the side of her face. â€œI thought I heard your voice. What are you still doing here?â€\nStraddling Santa Claus didnâ€™t seem like an appropriate response, so she avoided answering.\nâ€œDaddy, is that you?â€ she asked instead, although sheâ€™d already recognized the his voice.\nâ€œYes, sweetheart. I thought you went home with mom. Is everything all right?â€\nâ€œEverythingâ€™s fine,â€ Santa answered from beside her. His hand slid across Graceâ€™s butt and caressed her through her skirt.\nGrace didnâ€™t want to make a scene, and she knew her Dad couldnâ€™t see behind her from his vantage point, so she stood her ground. â€œIâ€™ll get you back for this,â€ she whispered out the side of her mouth.\nâ€œPromise?â€ He slapped her little butt lightly and chuckled.\nGrace was about to utter a protest when the flashlightâ€™s beam moved over to settle between her and her mysterious Santa.\nâ€œOh, Jas,â€ came her dadâ€™s voice. â€œI had no idea you were here too.â€\nâ€œThatâ€™s all right, Simon. We were talking about gifts.â€\nGraceâ€™s mouth worked, but nothing came out, as she stared at Santa. Jas?\nâ€œBut I have to leave you two now. Good night, Gracie.â€\nGrace studied his genuinely disappointed look for a moment, then reached out and took his hands in hers. She placed them on the front of her blouse and smiled.\nâ€œWill you bring me a present next time?â€\nâ€œYesâ€¦â€ He whispered, bowing down to kiss her cheek. â€œItâ€™s a date.â€\nThe End\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Little Grace paced back and forth next to the long line of children standing before a large, empty, red-velvet chair. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; she muttered, studying the crowd for the fifth time, looking for her dad.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a large red blob, coming around a corner, caught her attention. Thank goodness. She rushed forward to greet her dad who volunteered to wear a Santa costume for a local charity, but immediately stopped when she came closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds like you&rsquo;re a store employee, trying to sell me something. Not all my wishes are toys, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The area was suddenly plunged into darkness, and Grace stiffened. She hated the dark with a passion, always had. She even slept with a light on at night just to chase the shadows away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Santa whispered in her ear. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How did he know? He must have felt the change in her body. She tried to get up, but he wouldn&rsquo;t release her. Finally, she expelled a heavy breath and settled on his lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm. White beard, big belly, red suit. I think I&rsquo;m Santa Claus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I mean really.&rdquo; Little girl peered into his compelling blue eyes, which looked somehow familiar, even though she knew she&rsquo;d never met him.</p>
<p>He simply shrugged.</p>
<p>Slowly, Grace reached out and began to peel away his costume. She had to see the real man. She was a little surprised when he didn&rsquo;t try to stop her.</p>
<p>The red hat came off first. Then the white beard and mustache-revealing a strong, square jaw and full lips. The big white wig was next - his natural hair was a light, sandy brown. Geez, he was handsome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it matter, little Gracie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She frowned. Why was he being so mysterious? He must be hiding something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to let me get up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about it.&rdquo; His fingers moved along her slender thigh.</p>
<p>Grace pulled at her short school skirt, feeling vulnerable. She should have worn pants today, but then, she hadn&rsquo;t expected to be groped by Santa Claus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your skin is so soft, Gracie. What are you hiding under there, little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slapped his hand. &ldquo;None of your business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ignored her slap and slid his fingers higher. &ldquo;You gave everyone a present today. How about a present for Santa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace&rsquo;s heart thudded in her small chest. &ldquo;What exactly did you have in mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you won&rsquo;t whisper your desires in my ear, I&rsquo;ll whisper mine in yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His lips slid along her little ear, teasing the sensitive skin there. Grace trembled as a jolt of desire vibrated through her 11-year-old body. Erotic words spoken huskily against her ear caused her blood to heat and her limbs to feel like jello.</p>
<p>Pulling back, he smiled into her blue eyes. &ldquo;Come on, Gracie. Let&rsquo;s end the year with a&hellip; bang.&rdquo; He chuckled and pulled her beautiful legs to either side of his lap, so she was straddling him.</p>
<p>Her school skirt rose up her thighs. Grace gasped at the intimate contact and glanced around. She knew he could see her pink panties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; he whispered against her temple, as his hands slid down to cup her little bottom.</p>
<p>She squirmed, but didn&rsquo;t try to get away. She liked the feel of his hands on her eleven-year-old body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? And do that again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squirm on my lap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grace!&rdquo; a booming voice called out. &ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace&rsquo;s head snapped toward the sound. &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; She pulled against Santa, until he released her, then she jumped off his lap. She started toward her dad&rsquo;s voice, coming from the other side of a chest-high mound of gifts ready for giveaway in tomorrow&rsquo;s promotion. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flashlight illuminated the area just to the side of her face. &ldquo;I thought I heard your voice. What are you still doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straddling Santa Claus didn&rsquo;t seem like an appropriate response, so she avoided answering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy, is that you?&rdquo; she asked instead, although she&rsquo;d already recognized the his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sweetheart. I thought you went home with mom. Is everything all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Santa answered from beside her. His hand slid across Grace&rsquo;s butt and caressed her through her skirt.</p>
<p>Grace didn&rsquo;t want to make a scene, and she knew her Dad couldn&rsquo;t see behind her from his vantage point, so she stood her ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you back for this,&rdquo; she whispered out the side of her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise?&rdquo; He slapped her little butt lightly and chuckled.</p>
<p>Grace was about to utter a protest when the flashlight&rsquo;s beam moved over to settle between her and her mysterious Santa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jas,&rdquo; came her dad&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I had no idea you were here too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Simon. We were talking about gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace&rsquo;s mouth worked, but nothing came out, as she stared at Santa. Jas?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have to leave you two now. Good night, Gracie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace studied his genuinely disappointed look for a moment, then reached out and took his hands in hers. She placed them on the front of her blouse and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you bring me a present next time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo; He whispered, bowing down to kiss her cheek. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The End</p>
