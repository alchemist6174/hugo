  "articleBody": "By the midnight on the summer Saturday evening, there was a lull in the activities with Hannah by the two men. She had been allowed to dress again, wash the semen from her mouth, and was told to get ready for bed. This was because teacher Dan’s ’nice idea’ was for them both to ‘put her to bed’, kind of like two gay parents - except they were not gay. She was clearly tired, with grey shadows under her eyes, after 4 hours of two pedophiles’ idea of ‘play’. Michelle, her Mum, was not due back from work until 3am, so in theory the fun and games could have continued for longer. Dan, however, thought it kind to bring closure for today and let her retire to bed, as most kids of her age would have done by now. He was clearly going to be an astute psychologist in the whole program of abuse, which Sean hoped could continue safely for at least another year or so. Dan explained that this tactic would bring emotional reinforcement to her hugely prematurely-sexed lifestyle, as the end of the evening reverted to more child-appropriate love and tenderness, but in an erotic context.\nThey walked her upstairs, in her normal casual clothes, with Dan holding her hand. Sean found their ‘relationship’ fascinating. Before this evening, he had only been schoolteacher to her, but now that was thoroughly combined with ’lover’. Sean believed him when he said he actually genuinally did ’love’ her, beyond mere pedo sex lust that is. Sean himself was much less sentimental - not exactly ‘cruel’, but in his own words, ‘did not give much of a shit about her.’ Or any of the other 7 children he had seriously molested in his life, for that matter.\nTo Sean’s amusement, and mild impatience, Dan even supervised Hannah cleaning her teeth. 9-year-olds ought to know how to do this well, Dan told her, but he just wanted to check. He was ‘concerned for her health’, you see, and concerned for her generally - just as any teacher should be. Then he explained he would ’lay with her’ in bed, they would ‘make love’ for 20 minutes, and then he would bid her goodnight when he was satisfied she was okay. Damn, he even said it with a smile that betrayed no conflict of morality whatsoever. Brilliant!\nBoth men watched as Hannah got out of her T-shirt, jeans, socks and her little red knickers in that order. Sean, of course, had enacted this routine with her many times but it was always delicious: a child, a 9-year-old girl, going through the motions of readying herself for sex just as women the world over do at nightime. Whereas a woman might do it with sensual enthusiasm, Hannah did it with a weary semi-sad look, although these days she was ‘getting’ the erotic nature of it a bit. It was difficult to say how much of that was an act - because she knew it pleased him - or how much she really ‘felt’ any ego-kick of love and attention from it. Naturally, she was a little scared tonight with it being the first time ‘making love’ with her schoolteacher. And his thing on hard was every bit as big as Sean’s; yes, she had a technical understanding of what ’love-making’ meant.\nHer smooth, small nude body climbed into the bed with a vulnerable smile, whilst Dan undressed to join her. As the men had conspired, Sean gave Hannah a kiss on the forehead whilst she layed there under the covers looking up at him. She felt a mixture of fear, but a kind of ’need’ for his approval, but mostly fear - in a similar way to a child fearing a very strict teacher. She smiled meekly at his kiss and softly-spoken ‘goodnight’. Then he left her with Dan, to whom she clearly feared enough to give total obedience, but not so much that she didn’t ’like him’. He had the skill of talking on her level, and getting close to her feelings, whilst pretending his pedophile gratification with her was love. Hell, maybe to HIM it was. Sean closed the door on the two ’lovers’ and went downstairs to reflect on another good evening, and on the direction his alliance in child-abuse was taking.\n* * * * *\nSean half-expected to hear a familiar squeak, yelp or whinging tone or two from Hannah, but all that filtered down from the bedroom were quiet mutterings and eventually some dull grunts and gasps from Dan. Possibly there was a sweet moan from Hannah, but it didn’t seem to be pain especially. All became clear when Dan joined him half an hour later, tidy, clothed and professional, not at all like someone who had been having a sex with a child.\n“She’ll go off to sleep pretty soon, I think,” he said.\n“Okay, good. How’s she seem, then?”\n“Pretty fine, really, considering.”\n“Considering? Considering I’m ‘wrecking’ her?”\n“Hey, my friend, I’m ‘wrecking’ her too now, aren’t I?” said Dan.\n“Well, yeah. But how, in your professsional opinion, is she doing? Not trying to be funny.”\n“I think she’s doing okay. I’d say her level of strain is quite a way from breaking point, just so long as we keep showing her episodes of kindness and neutral fun and games.”\n“‘Episodes of kindness’, ’neutral fun and games’?”\n“Yep, you know…”\n“I know. Mix up all the sex with normal kiddy things and being nice to her and stuff.”\n“Yup, that’s about it.”\n“Thanks.”\n“‘Thanks’?”\n“Yes. You’re welcome, seriously. I think we’ll make a great team.”\n“Cool, glad you think so. Really glad, actually.”\n“So, you want more of her?” asked Sean, with a grin.\n“Yes,” said Dan, grimly.\n“Ha! Told you so!” Sean slapped him on the shoulder. “No problem.”\n“Yep, you told me, and you were right: I guess it is a drug.”\n“Cheers.” Sean toasted Dan’s glass of water with his beer can.\n“Cheers.”\n“So, my friend. What did you do with her up there?”\n“Ahh, nothing much, Chatting to her. Gave her a little lecture, a pep-talk.”\n“Pillow-pep-talk, eh?”\n“Hehe, yes. Good way to put it.”\n“Saying what?”\nDan shrugged. “I told her she’s a lovely, brave girl. A very special girl, and that I am her ‘special’ teacher. I explained my job is to teach her school stuff but also general ’life-stuff’ with it, with sex being part of that.”\n“I see.”\n“I reminded her that it all has to be secret, and how she’ll go to a horrible orphanage if she ever talks, and all that. And how she’ll wind up being a sex slave for some fat Arabs or huge black men forever, and beaten and whipped as well as all the stuff they do to her holes.”\n“Good. Reinforces what I’ve been telling her, with the Arab-nigger stuff being a nice addition. But what sex did you do?”\n“Well, for a while just canoodling, while I told her all this. God, she’s cute…” He sighed, closing his eyes.\nSean chuckled. “I know, I know.” He reflected on her tender, white body, with its femininity barely apparent save for fledgling bum-curvature and the little fuck-slot.\n“It’s not just her body,” purred Dan, as if reading his conspirator’s mind, “but her face. Love her face.”\nSean felt safe to assume Dan would have been kissing those soft, round cheeks, the little ears and dainty little nose repeatedly while pillow-talking her. “So, what else?”\n“Feeling her all over while we talked. Just stroking, rubbing: intimate but not invasive.”\n“Okay. All nice stuff, eh?”\n“Yes. Christ, it shouldn’t even be illegal.”\n“I’ve thought that for a long time,” said Sean, amused.\n“No, I mean the ’light’ stuff, at least, maybe even the heavier stuff -hell, she’ll get used to it.” Dan nodded earnestly to himself.\n“Okay. You did any ‘heavy’ stuff up there?”\nDan considered. “Well, yeah, I suppose. Just asked her to give me a hand-job while I layed over her, kissing her, stroking her face and stuff.”\n“Oh yeah, she’s good at that, the hand-job I mean.”\n“Yes, she is.”\n“Lip-kissing and mouth-kissing, was it?”\n“A bit,” shrugged Dan. “She was very tired. I tried not to be too demanding.”\n“I think you’ve been very easy on her all evening, to be honest.”\n“Yes, well I came mostly on her belly and some on her thighs, I think. I did try to point myself on her cunt, with her help, for the finish, but not very accurate.” Dan chuckled.\n“Ha, yeah, it takes practise. And you can have plenty of that, if you want.”\n“I’ll tell you something - it’s every bit as beautiful as I hoped.”\n“What is?”\n“Sex with a child.” Suddenly some self-consiousness crept into Dan’s face, as the enormity of the night started to sink in.\n“Well, yes. It’s unique. Not like adult sex at all. And must be a hell of a release for YOU, being a teacher and all, seeing them every day.”\n“Yep.” Dan nodded with a wry smile, as if acknowledging a universal truth.\n“You think a lot of teachers are pedos?” asked Sean.\nDan took the question seriously. “Among male primary teachers… hmmm… I’d guess about half harbour the fantasies to some extent, yup.”\n“Cool. I’d have guessed more, but I’ll take your word.”\nDan chuckled, embarrassed. “Hey, I’m only guessing too.”\n“So,” Sean said, imitating his guest’s more genial manner, “how would you like to enact some more of those fantasies you’ve been harbouring?”\n“I’d like,” said Dan, simply.\n“Perhaps if you visit twice a week, but no more than that, okay?”\n“Hell, no, for discretion’s sake that would be plenty. Thanks.”\n“You’re welcome. You’re a useful help in everything and, besides, it’s damned hot seeing another guy have pleasure with her.”\nChrist, just seeing another guy in no uncertain terms getting an erection from the presence of pretty child flesh was bloody hot, mused Sean.\n“Thanks. I hope I don’t cramp your style at all. Believe me, I do want to do more with her. I’m not gonna go all soft on her, so to speak.”\nSean chuckled. “Good. So, what do you envisage for next time?”\n“Well, for a start, I’ll have to try penetrating her. Get started on her for real, so to speak.”\n“Which hole? Or both?”\n“Vaginal, I think, primarily.” It was kind of amusing, seeing how seriously Dan reflected on it. “To me that’s the ultimate act of sex generally, so it’s the ultimate act in sexing a kid too.”\n“I take your point. I’ve probably done more up her arse than her cunny, though,” said Dan.\n“Jeez, really?”\n“Yes. For me, putting your dick up a little girl’s arse is the ultimate act of… I dunno… it’s just so…”\n\" ‘Depravity’?\" suggested Dan.\n“Yeah, that could be the word. Well, I mean it’s not the place it’s ‘supposed’ to go, is it?”\n“I take your point, my friend. It’s fully taboo, for sure, and she does have a lovely little arse for sure.”\n“Yes, Dan, I think we both know that.” They chuckled. “I can’t stop using it.”\n“I’m sure. Well, to next time, then…”\n“Cheers.”\n“And to you fucking Hannah.”\n“Hey,” whispered Dan, “not too loud. She might still be awake.”\n“Doesn’t matter,” said Sean gruffly. “She knows what it’s all about.”\n“Yeah, I want it to be a surprise for her, though. When ‘I’ do it, that is.”\n“Hehe. Okay, sure. Well, it’s been a nice easy night for her tonight.”\n“It has? Well, good. It was important, I think, for my first session with her,” said Dan.\n“Good thinking. Quite unusual, though.”\n“What is?”\n“To have a long session, and no pussy or anal penetration at all. Only two mouth-fucks from me, and a bum-grind and hand-job from you.”\n“And cunt and arse-licking from me.”\n“Oh, yeah.”\n“And lots of feeling from both of us.”\n“Well, that goes without saying.”\n“Yeah, I suppose it would,” said Dan.\n“More often than not, I include one or the other hole, or both in the fun,” Sean explained. “Funny that neither of us did it tonight.”\n“Yep, well, next time…”\n“Yep.”\n“Tell me,” said Dan. “How far up her arse do you get it?”\nSean shrugged, and smiled. It was so satisfying to be able to share this kind of knowledge. “It depends on the session. Sometimes it’s just a poke, and only part of the fun, and sometimes it’s the main cum-target.”\n“Well, when it’s the main cum-target?”\n“Ohhh… two, maybe three inches, I guess. Maybe more is possible. I’ve heard said it is, for a 9-year-old.”\n“Jeeez.” Dan rolled his eyes. “Maybe I’ll do both holes next time.”\n“Whatever you want, mister.”\nTHE END\nAny thoughts creative, erotic, philosophical, moral at all are welcome here or to the email above.\nAlso, anybody who would like to be ‘another guy’ in the story, email me with some basic ideas on your character, such as how he might know Sean or Dan, and your sexual-pedo ‘style’ (bad, mad or gentle etc).\nYou would have to come in where the series leaves off, though (after part 21). A new part is uploaded every day.\n",

Dan, however, thought it kind to bring closure for today and let her retire to bed, as most kids of her age would have done by now. He was clearly going to be an astute psychologist in the whole program of abuse, which Sean hoped could continue safely for at least another year or so. Dan explained that this tactic would bring emotional reinforcement to her hugely prematurely-sexed lifestyle, as the end of the evening reverted to more child-appropriate love and tenderness, but in an erotic context.</p>
<p>They walked her upstairs, in her normal casual clothes, with Dan holding her hand. Sean found their &lsquo;relationship&rsquo; fascinating. Before this evening, he had only been schoolteacher to her, but now that was thoroughly combined with &rsquo;lover&rsquo;. Sean believed him when he said he actually genuinally did &rsquo;love&rsquo; her, beyond mere pedo sex lust that is. Sean himself was much less sentimental - not exactly &lsquo;cruel&rsquo;, but in his own words, &lsquo;did not give much of a shit about her.&rsquo; Or any of the other 7 children he had seriously molested in his life, for that matter.</p>
<p>To Sean&rsquo;s amusement, and mild impatience, Dan even supervised Hannah cleaning her teeth. 9-year-olds ought to know how to do this well, Dan told her, but he just wanted to check. He was &lsquo;concerned for her health&rsquo;, you see, and concerned for her generally - just as any teacher should be. Then he explained he would &rsquo;lay with her&rsquo; in bed, they would &lsquo;make love&rsquo; for 20 minutes, and then he would bid her goodnight when he was satisfied she was okay. Damn, he even said it with a smile that betrayed no conflict of morality whatsoever. Brilliant!</p>
<p>Both men watched as Hannah got out of her T-shirt, jeans, socks and her little red knickers in that order. Sean, of course, had enacted this routine with her many times but it was always delicious: a child, a 9-year-old girl, going through the motions of readying herself for sex just as women the world over do at nightime. Whereas a woman might do it with sensual enthusiasm, Hannah did it with a weary semi-sad look, although these days she was &lsquo;getting&rsquo; the erotic nature of it a bit. It was difficult to say how much of that was an act - because she knew it pleased him - or how much she really &lsquo;felt&rsquo; any ego-kick of love and attention from it. Naturally, she was a little scared tonight with it being the first time &lsquo;making love&rsquo; with her schoolteacher. And his thing on hard was every bit as big as Sean&rsquo;s; yes, she had a technical understanding of what &rsquo;love-making&rsquo; meant.</p>
<p>Her smooth, small nude body climbed into the bed with a vulnerable smile, whilst Dan undressed to join her. As the men had conspired, Sean gave Hannah a kiss on the forehead whilst she layed there under the covers looking up at him. She felt a mixture of fear, but a kind of &rsquo;need&rsquo; for his approval, but mostly fear - in a similar way to a child fearing a very strict teacher. She smiled meekly at his kiss and softly-spoken &lsquo;goodnight&rsquo;. Then he left her with Dan, to whom she clearly feared enough to give total obedience, but not so much that she didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;like him&rsquo;. He had the skill of talking on her level, and getting close to her feelings, whilst pretending his pedophile gratification with her was love. Hell, maybe to HIM it was. Sean closed the door on the two &rsquo;lovers&rsquo; and went downstairs to reflect on another good evening, and on the direction his alliance in child-abuse was taking.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Sean half-expected to hear a familiar squeak, yelp or whinging tone or two from Hannah, but all that filtered down from the bedroom were quiet mutterings and eventually some dull grunts and gasps from Dan. Possibly there was a sweet moan from Hannah, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to be pain especially. All became clear when Dan joined him half an hour later, tidy, clothed and professional, not at all like someone who had been having a sex with a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll go off to sleep pretty soon, I think,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, good. How&rsquo;s she seem, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty fine, really, considering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering? Considering I&rsquo;m &lsquo;wrecking&rsquo; her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, my friend, I&rsquo;m &lsquo;wrecking&rsquo; her too now, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yeah. But how, in your professsional opinion, is she doing? Not trying to be funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s doing okay. I&rsquo;d say her level of strain is quite a way from breaking point, just so long as we keep showing her episodes of kindness and neutral fun and games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Episodes of kindness&rsquo;, &rsquo;neutral fun and games&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Mix up all the sex with normal kiddy things and being nice to her and stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup, that&rsquo;s about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thanks&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;re welcome, seriously. I think we&rsquo;ll make a great team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cool, glad you think so. Really glad, actually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you want more of her?&rdquo; asked Sean, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dan, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Told you so!&rdquo; Sean slapped him on the shoulder. &ldquo;No problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, you told me, and you were right: I guess it is a drug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheers.&rdquo; Sean toasted Dan&rsquo;s glass of water with his beer can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, my friend. What did you do with her up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh, nothing much, Chatting to her. Gave her a little lecture, a pep-talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pillow-pep-talk, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hehe, yes. Good way to put it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saying what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan shrugged. &ldquo;I told her she&rsquo;s a lovely, brave girl. A very special girl, and that I am her &lsquo;special&rsquo; teacher. I explained my job is to teach her school stuff but also general &rsquo;life-stuff&rsquo; with it, with sex being part of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reminded her that it all has to be secret, and how she&rsquo;ll go to a horrible orphanage if she ever talks, and all that. And how she&rsquo;ll wind up being a sex slave for some fat Arabs or huge black men forever, and beaten and whipped as well as all the stuff they do to her holes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Reinforces what I&rsquo;ve been telling her, with the Arab-nigger stuff being a nice addition. But what sex did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for a while just canoodling, while I told her all this. God, she&rsquo;s cute&hellip;&rdquo; He sighed, closing his eyes.</p>
<p>Sean chuckled. &ldquo;I know, I know.&rdquo; He reflected on her tender, white body, with its femininity barely apparent save for fledgling bum-curvature and the little fuck-slot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just her body,&rdquo; purred Dan, as if reading his conspirator&rsquo;s mind, &ldquo;but her face. Love her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sean felt safe to assume Dan would have been kissing those soft, round cheeks, the little ears and dainty little nose repeatedly while pillow-talking her. &ldquo;So, what else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feeling her all over while we talked. Just stroking, rubbing: intimate but not invasive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. All nice stuff, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Christ, it shouldn&rsquo;t even be illegal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought that for a long time,&rdquo; said Sean, amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean the &rsquo;light&rsquo; stuff, at least, maybe even the heavier stuff -hell, she&rsquo;ll get used to it.&rdquo; Dan nodded earnestly to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. You did any &lsquo;heavy&rsquo; stuff up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan considered. &ldquo;Well, yeah, I suppose. Just asked her to give me a hand-job while I layed over her, kissing her, stroking her face and stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, she&rsquo;s good at that, the hand-job I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lip-kissing and mouth-kissing, was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bit,&rdquo; shrugged Dan. &ldquo;She was very tired. I tried not to be too demanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve been very easy on her all evening, to be honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, well I came mostly on her belly and some on her thighs, I think. I did try to point myself on her cunt, with her help, for the finish, but not very accurate.&rdquo; Dan chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, yeah, it takes practise. And you can have plenty of that, if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something - it&rsquo;s every bit as beautiful as I hoped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sex with a child.&rdquo; Suddenly some self-consiousness crept into Dan&rsquo;s face, as the enormity of the night started to sink in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes. It&rsquo;s unique. Not like adult sex at all. And must be a hell of a release for YOU, being a teacher and all, seeing them every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Dan nodded with a wry smile, as if acknowledging a universal truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think a lot of teachers are pedos?&rdquo; asked Sean.</p>
<p>Dan took the question seriously. &ldquo;Among male primary teachers&hellip; hmmm&hellip; I&rsquo;d guess about half harbour the fantasies to some extent, yup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cool. I&rsquo;d have guessed more, but I&rsquo;ll take your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan chuckled, embarrassed. &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m only guessing too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Sean said, imitating his guest&rsquo;s more genial manner, &ldquo;how would you like to enact some more of those fantasies you&rsquo;ve been harbouring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; said Dan, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if you visit twice a week, but no more than that, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell, no, for discretion&rsquo;s sake that would be plenty. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome. You&rsquo;re a useful help in everything and, besides, it&rsquo;s damned hot seeing another guy have pleasure with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ, just seeing another guy in no uncertain terms getting an erection from the presence of pretty child flesh was bloody hot, mused Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. I hope I don&rsquo;t cramp your style at all. Believe me, I do want to do more with her. I&rsquo;m not gonna go all soft on her, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sean chuckled. &ldquo;Good. So, what do you envisage for next time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for a start, I&rsquo;ll have to try penetrating her. Get started on her for real, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which hole? Or both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vaginal, I think, primarily.&rdquo; It was kind of amusing, seeing how seriously Dan reflected on it. &ldquo;To me that&rsquo;s the ultimate act of sex generally, so it&rsquo;s the ultimate act in sexing a kid too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take your point. I&rsquo;ve probably done more up her arse than her cunny, though,&rdquo; said Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeez, really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. For me, putting your dick up a little girl&rsquo;s arse is the ultimate act of&hellip; I dunno&hellip; it&rsquo;s just so&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot; &lsquo;Depravity&rsquo;?&quot; suggested Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that could be the word. Well, I mean it&rsquo;s not the place it&rsquo;s &lsquo;supposed&rsquo; to go, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take your point, my friend. It&rsquo;s fully taboo, for sure, and she does have a lovely little arse for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dan, I think we both know that.&rdquo; They chuckled. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop using it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure. Well, to next time, then&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to you fucking Hannah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; whispered Dan, &ldquo;not too loud. She might still be awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Sean gruffly. &ldquo;She knows what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I want it to be a surprise for her, though. When &lsquo;I&rsquo; do it, that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hehe. Okay, sure. Well, it&rsquo;s been a nice easy night for her tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has? Well, good. It was important, I think, for my first session with her,&rdquo; said Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thinking. Quite unusual, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have a long session, and no pussy or anal penetration at all. Only two mouth-fucks from me, and a bum-grind and hand-job from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And cunt and arse-licking from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lots of feeling from both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that goes without saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I suppose it would,&rdquo; said Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More often than not, I include one or the other hole, or both in the fun,&rdquo; Sean explained. &ldquo;Funny that neither of us did it tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, well, next time&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;How far up her arse do you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sean shrugged, and smiled. It was so satisfying to be able to share this kind of knowledge. &ldquo;It depends on the session. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just a poke, and only part of the fun, and sometimes it&rsquo;s the main cum-target.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when it&rsquo;s the main cum-target?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohhh&hellip; two, maybe three inches, I guess. Maybe more is possible. I&rsquo;ve heard said it is, for a 9-year-old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeeez.&rdquo; Dan rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll do both holes next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you want, mister.&rdquo;</p>
