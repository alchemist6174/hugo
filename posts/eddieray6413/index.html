  "articleBody": "During high school I had very few friends. Due to my family’s economics I had very few dates. Most girls don’t want to catch the bus to go on a date, and many parents will not let their little girls go out when her date shows up in a taxi. That did not stop me from trying.\nI grew up in the south during the 1960’s and 70’s. My parents divorced when I was 9, and I lived with my mother. We kids did not have the latest fashions, and when school started we did not have the basic school supplies to even do our school work. I was basically a poor white kid that knew economic hard times. When I arrived at Engle High School, one of my classes was ROTC. It was in this class that I met her. Oh, she was beautiful - gorgeous - and her name was ‘Juanita’. She had long black hair, brown eyes, and a figure that drove all the boys crazy. Her measurements were 34b, 23, 33. I kept getting into trouble for being out of step marching, from watching Juanita’s ass shake.\nI was taken to my instructor who said, “Larry put your eyes back in your head boy, and pay attention.”\nI said, “yes sir.”\nAll the boys wanted to date her, myself included. Then it happened. I asked Juanita out and she said ‘yes’. I had some serious problems to go with that date. How would I tell my mother I have a date with the hottest black girl on high school campus? I found out when I arrived home that I did not have to, as my younger sister had told her for me.\n“What is this I hear?” my mother asked, as I walked through the door. “You have a date with a nigger?”\n“Maybe,” I said. “What of it?” This provoked a long argument between myself, my mother and my sister.\nFinally, mother said, “I forbid you to see her.”\n“I am sixteen now,” I retorted. “I work and go to school. You can’t control me like you did when I was nine! Now, if you don’t mind, I have to go to the library to do my homework before I go to work.”\nMother then slapped me in the face.\n“Don’t worry about me,” was my response. “I’m going to granny’s house after work until you calm down.”\nI went to work and Juanita was already there. “What did your parents say when they found out we were dating?” I asked.\n“They were still at work.”\n“It provoked an argument at my house,” I said, “followed by me being slapped in the face.”\n“I’m sorry.”\n“Well, it’s not your fault.”\nJuanita laughed. We kissed and then punched in for our shift. That night we took our breaks together, held hands and kissed some more.\nWhen I returned from break, my manager said, “Nigger lover.”\n“That’s an inappropriate remark,” I said, simply.\nWe were both terminated that night. We went to corporate and had a meeting with the Vice President. I explained what was going on and he said he would contact Juanita and I in a week. One week later we were back in the job, and the manager was no longer employed. Juanita and I endured taunts at school as well, though.\n“Why are you dating a haunkie,” said one black guy to Juanita, “when you know black men have bigger dicks?”\n“Having a bigger dick does not make you a better man,” she responded.\nI went to class and one of my classmates enquired, “Been to the zoo lately to pick up your date?”\nOur first date was memorable and eventful. We had dinner at Long John Silvers, then we had a half-time performance at our football game. After the game we went to a movie. We were asked to leave half way through the movie because management had received numerous complaints about ‘a mixed-race couple in attendance’. Well, at least we were given a full refund of all monies spent. We went home. I apologized to Juanita for the way we were treated.\n“I’m used to it,” she said.\nI hugged her and kissed her. We held each other for a few moments. “It’s almost time to have you home.”\n“I love you,” said Juanita, smiling.\n“I love you too.”\nI took her home, walked her to the door and kissed her good night. Also, I asked her if she wanted to go out tomorrow. She did. I said I would pick her up at 5 pm. I called my Uncle that night and explained what happened. He told me to take her skating, which I thought was a great idea. I picked Juanita up, we had dinner at McDonalds, and from there went to the Roller Rink. It was uneventful, because there was a church group there that night, and we were pretty much accepted.\nWe were working ourselves to bigger and bolder things. Juanita and I were told we could not attend home-coming dance. We filed an appeal to the school board who said - and I quote - ‘mixed race couples cannot be banned from any school function.’\nWe attended homecoming dance. It was not a big dance event and all of the red-necks were elsewhere that night. Juanita and I danced the night away in our ROTC uniforms, as we had to perform for the home-coming parade and at half-time.\nJuanita and I were becoming very close and inseparable during this time. Our Guidance Counsellor had us in and talked with us. He was a very nice, black gentleman.\n“I am concerned with the amount of time you two are spending together,” he said.\n“You don’t want us to date?” I replied.\n“Of course I want you two to date, but you have to be careful. I am concerned about your safety.”\n“Let us worry about that,” I said.\nHe just smiled and said to Juanita, “You keep him, he really loves you.”\n“I know,” she said.\nThree weeks later we had our next date. We were on a three-day field trip to an Air Force base in Virginia. Juanita and I went to a movie on base the first night. We had no problems. I kissed Juanita very passionately that night. She kissed me passionately in return, as we made out for an hour. We went back to the dorm and our respective rooms. On our second night, we went to dinner and bowling. Later, we snuck out of the dorm after the bed check. We went to the park two blocks away with a blanket. We started making out. We kissed passionately.\nJuanita looked at me and said, \" I want to make love to you, but I’m a virgin.\"\n“So am I,” said I, and we both laughed. “I love you so much.”\nShe smiled. “You make me so happy.”\nWe undressed and started kissing even more passionately than before. Juanita climbed on top of me, grabbed my dick and started to lower herself on me. She managed to get the tip in, and then she just impaled herself on me. She let out a muffled scream as she tore through her hymen, giving me her virginity and I giving her mine. We made love for two hours, and came hard our last time. We went back to the dorm, kissed each other good night and went to our rooms. Four hours later, we had our last tour of the base and then back to the campus: a six hour drive. We both slept most of the way back.\nWe kept the blanket we made love on the night before, still with her blood stain on it.\nWe continued to date, and the next big one was prom. I chose a dark tuxedo with a light blue shirt, while Juanita chose a turquoise dress. We looked spectacular together. I went out early that day and got us a hotel room. I rented a limo and picked her up at 4 pm. We went to The Red Lobster for dinner, and arrived at prom around 6 pm. We began dancing.\n“Well, if it ain’t the white boy with his pet monkey!” said one of our classmates.\n“That was inappropriate,” I said.\n“I can’t hear you, nigger lover.”\nThen, five of his friends joined him, and I knew this was not going to be a fun night for either Juanita or I. We tried to continue dancing, but our six new ‘friends’ did everything in their power to prevent that. We did get a few more dances in, before deciding it was time to leave.\n“You aren’t going anywhere,” said one of them.\nAnother lunged at me, and I stood in front of Juanita to protect her as we were backed into a corner. I hit him, and another came at me and I hit him too, knocking him down. Then the other four swarmed me and I was done for. Two of them held me while the other four worked me over good. My eyes were blackened and I was bleeding badly when Juanita’s cousins became aware of what was happening. When they jumped in, our six attackers took off real quick. The cousins helped us to my car and we left the prom. We got to our hotel and went to our room.\n“Let me get a warm wash-cloth and clean your face,” said Juanita. She gently rubbed my face and began kissing me lightly. She gently stroked my cheek, and I held her hand. “Look at your tux. It is not in very good shape.”\n“The store is going to be pissed about this,” I said. Juanita laughed, then she started to cry. “What’s wrong?\n“Is it always going to be like this?”\n“Like what?”\n“The taunts. The hatred. The battle of the races?”\n“Come here,” I said. She sat down beside me. “In three weeks I take my final exams, and in four weeks I will be seventeen. In five weeks I am graduating high school, and in six weeks I will be in the army. Don’t worry, this will be over, because I plan on taking you away from this state as soon as you graduate.”\nJuanita looked at me and I kissed her. She leaned into me and kissed me back. I fell backwards on the bed, and she was over me. She said, “Sit up, I am going to take what’s left of your clothes off you.”\nI sat up and she removed my coat, shirt, shoes, then my pants and my underwear. Juanita removed her dress and shoes. She walked over to the bed and reached behind her, unhooking her bra and dropping it to the floor. Then she removed her panties and stepped out of them. I just smiled. She had me lay on my back and she straddled me, then lowered herself onto my stiff cock. She started moving up and down, laid across my chest and started to kiss me passionately.\nShe began to moan. “Oooooooohhhhhhh, my bbbbbbbbaaaaabbbbbby, I am ccccccuuuuuuummmmminnnnng.”\nThen I released seven large spurts into her awaiting pussy.\nShe looked at me. “Oh, baby, that was great,” she said.\nI smiled. We told each other, “I Love You,” and we kissed passionately again.\n“Here, sit on my face,” I said.\n“What are you going to do?” Juanita asked.\n“I am going to eat your pussy.”\nShe sat on my face, and I began to eat her pussy. It was not long before she was grinding it into my face. She started moaning, and I continued to lick. “Oooooohhhhhh shit, oooooohhhhh that feels soooooooo goooooooooood. I am cuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmiiiiiiiinnnnnnggggg!”\nShe let herself go and flooded my mouth with her sweet nectar. Then she climbed off of me and we lay there together, then she climbed back on top, saying, “I am going to fuck your brains out.”\nIt was not long before I announced my orgasm and shot another six or seven spurts into her pussy. We were laying there in our after-glow when Juanita declared she had to be home in an hour.\n“I know, let’s shower and get dressed, and I will take you home.”\nWe arrived at Juanita’s house, and I walked her to her door to kiss her good night just as the porch light came on. Her mother called us both into the house and I was scared to death because her mother did not know I was white. Juanita introduced us.\n“Nice to meet you, maam,” I said.\nThen Juanita’s father walked into the room… and the look on his face! “Nita, who the hell is this cracker?”\nI turned to leave, but Juanita said, “No, you are going to stay.”\nTo her father, she said, “His name is Larry, not haunkie, saltine, or cracker or any other racial name. I have been dating him since school started and I want your blessing.”\nHer father took one look at me. “Who the hell have you been fighting? Muhammad Ali?”\n“No, sir,” I replied.\n“He was beaten up at prom by six white boys because he is dating me, but they ran off when Darius and his friends came to his defence,” explained Juanita.\n“Thank you for protecting my daughter.”\nJuanita’s mother looked at my face. “You need some stitches. Let me get my medical bag.”\nIt took ten stitches to close me up. I did not know her mother was a doctor.\n“Larry,” said Juanita’s father. “Do you know what kind of life you and Juanita are going to have by dating?”\n“Yes, sir, I do. We have been living it since school started. I love your daughter very much. I hope we get married.”\n“You are serious, aren’t you?”\n“I am going to be seventeen in a month,” I said, “and I am going into the Army in six weeks. Juanita is going to be a senior this fall.”\n“My name is Jim,” he said, “and my wife’s name is Barbara.”\n“Nice to finally know your names.”\nJuanita said, “Mom, please look at Larry’s rib cage and make sure nothing is broken.”\n“Okay,” said Barbara. “Off with your shirt.”\nI took it off. She said, “You better come by my office tomorrow so I can xray your ribs.”\n“Yes, maam.”\nThree weeks later we had our final exams. Both of us passed. Juanita was going to be a senior, and I was graduating. She was at my graduation. We were inseparable during the next three weeks. One day, I had an appointment with my recruiter for my testing and to prepare to leave. I showed up with Juanita.\n“John, this is my girlfriend Juanita,” I said.\n“Larry, you said she was pretty. You did not say she was drop-dead gorgeous. We will be leaving in ten minutes for your test.”\n“Can Juanita come along?” I asked.\n“Certainly.”\nFour hours later I had passed my test and was leaving in two days for Richmond. I asked John which bus line and he told me, ‘Trailways’. We left immediately for the station, and I bought Juanita a round-trip ticket. We both had to work that night and then we went to a hotel. We made love all night and most of the day the next day. We went to the mall and took pictures of us together, and she kept three as did I. Juanita gave me a picture of her that night to take with me. It was her school picture. We went to the recruiting station, and John drove us to the bus station. Juanita and I boarded the bus and were in Richmond four hours later. We checked into the hotel and I ordered room service. We ate, then we made love all night long. The next day I was given my physical and sworn in. I took Juanita to the bus station and made sure she was safe. I kissed her and we started to cry.\n“It wont be long,” I said, and we kissed passionately before she boarded and left.\nI arrived in South Carolina at 2.30 am, and had to get up at 4. I was one exhausted person. I called Juanita right after dinner and we talked for my allotted time of ten minutes. I was in South Carolina for three weeks. I wrote to Juanita every day, and she wrote back. All correspondence with my parents, however, was returned. My next stop was Georgia. I was to be there for three months. I met my best friend in basic on the first day: Ernie. One day I was looking at Juanita’s picture.\n“Who is the hot babe?” enquired Ernie.\n“Juanita, and she is my girl friend.” He asked if I was going to put her picture in my locker, and I said, “Maybe.”\n“Are you ashamed of her?” he asked.\n“No,” I said, “but you don’t know what we have been through.”\n“My wife is white,” said Ernie.\n“You are also from Chicago, where mixed race couples are accepted,” I said. “I was beaten up during prom because my girlfriend is black. I am afraid to stir controversy.”\n“I have your back,” said Ernie.\n“Then I will put the picture up.”\nTwo weeks after I got to boot camp, I got a letter from Juanita: ‘Dear Larry, This letter is to inform you that I am pregnant. I love you. Juanita.’\nI showed it to Ernie. “What are you going to do?” he asked.\n“Marry her.”\nHe smiled. I called Barbara and asked her what size ring Juanita wore, and she told me, ‘size 7’. I went to the px and bought a wedding set. It sat in my locker for another ten weeks. On Family night, Juanita and they were there.\n“Nigger lover,” said my drill sergeant. My company commander made him publicly apologize to myself and Juanita.\nI took a walk with her and asked her to marry me. She cried when I got down on one knee.\n“Yes,” she said.\nShe cried, as I was already doing, when I put the engagement ring on her finger.\n“Larry, I am happy for you both,” said Ernie.\n“Ernie, will you be my best man?”\n“Yes.”\nThree days before I left for Germany, Juanita and I were married. There were 151 people there including John, my recruiter, who before the wedding helped us fill out all the paper work so she could be listed as my dependent. No-one from my family showed. Three months after I arrived in Germany, Juanita and I received base housing. She came over 3 weeks later. Her parents came over for the birth of their first grandchild. I called my mother, who promptly hung up on me.\nWe spent ten years in the Army: four years in Germany, three in Colorado, then I spent two in Korea. We still live in Colorado. We are happy and we are accepted. We have 12 children and 6 grandchildren now. They were all at out house the other day as we celebrated 35 years together. I have no regrets and I am every bit a part of Juanita’s family as she is.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>During high school I had very few friends. Due to my family&rsquo;s economics I had very few dates. Most girls don&rsquo;t want to catch the bus to go on a date, and many parents will not let their little girls go out when her date shows up in a taxi. That did not stop me from trying.</p>
<p>I grew up in the south during the 1960&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s. My parents divorced when I was 9, and I lived with my mother. We kids did not have the latest fashions, and when school started we did not have the basic school supplies to even do our school work. I was basically a poor white kid that knew economic hard times. When I arrived at Engle High School, one of my classes was ROTC. It was in this class that I met her. Oh, she was beautiful - gorgeous - and her name was &lsquo;Juanita&rsquo;. She had long black hair, brown eyes, and a figure that drove all the boys crazy. Her measurements were 34b, 23, 33. I kept getting into trouble for being out of step marching, from watching Juanita&rsquo;s ass shake.</p>
<p>I was taken to my instructor who said, &ldquo;Larry put your eyes back in your head boy, and pay attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;yes sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the boys wanted to date her, myself included. Then it happened. I asked Juanita out and she said &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. I had some serious problems to go with that date. How would I tell my mother I have a date with the hottest black girl on high school campus? I found out when I arrived home that I did not have to, as my younger sister had told her for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this I hear?&rdquo; my mother asked, as I walked through the door. &ldquo;You have a date with a nigger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; This provoked a long argument between myself, my mother and my sister.</p>
<p>Finally, mother said, &ldquo;I forbid you to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sixteen now,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;I work and go to school. You can&rsquo;t control me like you did when I was nine! Now, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I have to go to the library to do my homework before I go to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother then slapped me in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me,&rdquo; was my response. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to granny&rsquo;s house after work until you calm down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went to work and Juanita was already there. &ldquo;What did your parents say when they found out we were dating?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were still at work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It provoked an argument at my house,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;followed by me being slapped in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juanita laughed. We kissed and then punched in for our shift. That night we took our breaks together, held hands and kissed some more.</p>
<p>When I returned from break, my manager said, &ldquo;Nigger lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an inappropriate remark,&rdquo; I said, simply.</p>
<p>We were both terminated that night. We went to corporate and had a meeting with the Vice President. I explained what was going on and he said he would contact Juanita and I in a week. One week later we were back in the job, and the manager was no longer employed. Juanita and I endured taunts at school as well, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you dating a haunkie,&rdquo; said one black guy to Juanita, &ldquo;when you know black men have bigger dicks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having a bigger dick does not make you a better man,&rdquo; she responded.</p>
<p>I went to class and one of my classmates enquired, &ldquo;Been to the zoo lately to pick up your date?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our first date was memorable and eventful. We had dinner at Long John Silvers, then we had a half-time performance at our football game. After the game we went to a movie. We were asked to leave half way through the movie because management had received numerous complaints about &lsquo;a mixed-race couple in attendance&rsquo;. Well, at least we were given a full refund of all monies spent. We went home. I apologized to Juanita for the way we were treated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I hugged her and kissed her. We held each other for a few moments. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost time to have you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; said Juanita, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took her home, walked her to the door and kissed her good night. Also, I asked her if she wanted to go out tomorrow. She did. I said I would pick her up at 5 pm. I called my Uncle that night and explained what happened. He told me to take her skating, which I thought was a great idea. I picked Juanita up, we had dinner at McDonalds, and from there went to the Roller Rink. It was uneventful, because there was a church group there that night, and we were pretty much accepted.</p>
<p>We were working ourselves to bigger and bolder things. Juanita and I were told we could not attend home-coming dance. We filed an appeal to the school board who said - and I quote - &lsquo;mixed race couples cannot be banned from any school function.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We attended homecoming dance. It was not a big dance event and all of the red-necks were elsewhere that night. Juanita and I danced the night away in our ROTC uniforms, as we had to perform for the home-coming parade and at half-time.</p>
<p>Juanita and I were becoming very close and inseparable during this time. Our Guidance Counsellor had us in and talked with us. He was a very nice, black gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am concerned with the amount of time you two are spending together,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want us to date?&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I want you two to date, but you have to be careful. I am concerned about your safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us worry about that,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He just smiled and said to Juanita, &ldquo;You keep him, he really loves you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Three weeks later we had our next date. We were on a three-day field trip to an Air Force base in Virginia. Juanita and I went to a movie on base the first night. We had no problems. I kissed Juanita very passionately that night. She kissed me passionately in return, as we made out for an hour. We went back to the dorm and our respective rooms. On our second night, we went to dinner and bowling. Later, we snuck out of the dorm after the bed check. We went to the park two blocks away with a blanket. We started making out. We kissed passionately.</p>
<p>Juanita looked at me and said, &quot; I want to make love to you, but I&rsquo;m a virgin.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said I, and we both laughed. &ldquo;I love you so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled. &ldquo;You make me so happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We undressed and started kissing even more passionately than before. Juanita climbed on top of me, grabbed my dick and started to lower herself on me. She managed to get the tip in, and then she just impaled herself on me. She let out a muffled scream as she tore through her hymen, giving me her virginity and I giving her mine. We made love for two hours, and came hard our last time. We went back to the dorm, kissed each other good night and went to our rooms. Four hours later, we had our last tour of the base and then back to the campus: a six hour drive. We both slept most of the way back.</p>
<p>We kept the blanket we made love on the night before, still with her blood stain on it.</p>
<p>We continued to date, and the next big one was prom. I chose a dark tuxedo with a light blue shirt, while Juanita chose a turquoise dress. We looked spectacular together. I went out early that day and got us a hotel room. I rented a limo and picked her up at 4 pm. We went to The Red Lobster for dinner, and arrived at prom around 6 pm. We began dancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it ain&rsquo;t the white boy with his pet monkey!&rdquo; said one of our classmates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was inappropriate,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear you, nigger lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, five of his friends joined him, and I knew this was not going to be a fun night for either Juanita or I. We tried to continue dancing, but our six new &lsquo;friends&rsquo; did everything in their power to prevent that. We did get a few more dances in, before deciding it was time to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going anywhere,&rdquo; said one of them.</p>
<p>Another lunged at me, and I stood in front of Juanita to protect her as we were backed into a corner. I hit him, and another came at me and I hit him too, knocking him down. Then the other four swarmed me and I was done for. Two of them held me while the other four worked me over good. My eyes were blackened and I was bleeding badly when Juanita&rsquo;s cousins became aware of what was happening. When they jumped in, our six attackers took off real quick. The cousins helped us to my car and we left the prom. We got to our hotel and went to our room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get a warm wash-cloth and clean your face,&rdquo; said Juanita. She gently rubbed my face and began kissing me lightly. She gently stroked my cheek, and I held her hand. &ldquo;Look at your tux. It is not in very good shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The store is going to be pissed about this,&rdquo; I said. Juanita laughed, then she started to cry. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it always going to be like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The taunts. The hatred. The battle of the races?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; I said. She sat down beside me. &ldquo;In three weeks I take my final exams, and in four weeks I will be seventeen. In five weeks I am graduating high school, and in six weeks I will be in the army. Don&rsquo;t worry, this will be over, because I plan on taking you away from this state as soon as you graduate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juanita looked at me and I kissed her. She leaned into me and kissed me back. I fell backwards on the bed, and she was over me. She said, &ldquo;Sit up, I am going to take what&rsquo;s left of your clothes off you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sat up and she removed my coat, shirt, shoes, then my pants and my underwear. Juanita removed her dress and shoes. She walked over to the bed and reached behind her, unhooking her bra and dropping it to the floor. Then she removed her panties and stepped out of them. I just smiled. She had me lay on my back and she straddled me, then lowered herself onto my stiff cock. She started moving up and down, laid across my chest and started to kiss me passionately.</p>
<p>She began to moan. &ldquo;Oooooooohhhhhhh, my bbbbbbbbaaaaabbbbbby, I am ccccccuuuuuuummmmminnnnng.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I released seven large spurts into her awaiting pussy.</p>
<p>She looked at me. &ldquo;Oh, baby, that was great,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I smiled. We told each other, &ldquo;I Love You,&rdquo; and we kissed passionately again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, sit on my face,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Juanita asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to eat your pussy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat on my face, and I began to eat her pussy. It was not long before she was grinding it into my face. She started moaning, and I continued to lick. &ldquo;Oooooohhhhhh shit, oooooohhhhh that feels soooooooo goooooooooood. I am cuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmiiiiiiiinnnnnnggggg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She let herself go and flooded my mouth with her sweet nectar. Then she climbed off of me and we lay there together, then she climbed back on top, saying, &ldquo;I am going to fuck your brains out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long before I announced my orgasm and shot another six or seven spurts into her pussy. We were laying there in our after-glow when Juanita declared she had to be home in an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, let&rsquo;s shower and get dressed, and I will take you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We arrived at Juanita&rsquo;s house, and I walked her to her door to kiss her good night just as the porch light came on. Her mother called us both into the house and I was scared to death because her mother did not know I was white. Juanita introduced us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you, maam,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Then Juanita&rsquo;s father walked into the room&hellip; and the look on his face! &ldquo;Nita, who the hell is this cracker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned to leave, but Juanita said, &ldquo;No, you are going to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her father, she said, &ldquo;His name is Larry, not haunkie, saltine, or cracker or any other racial name. I have been dating him since school started and I want your blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father took one look at me. &ldquo;Who the hell have you been fighting? Muhammad Ali?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was beaten up at prom by six white boys because he is dating me, but they ran off when Darius and his friends came to his defence,&rdquo; explained Juanita.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for protecting my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juanita&rsquo;s mother looked at my face. &ldquo;You need some stitches. Let me get my medical bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took ten stitches to close me up. I did not know her mother was a doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry,&rdquo; said Juanita&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;Do you know what kind of life you and Juanita are going to have by dating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I do. We have been living it since school started. I love your daughter very much. I hope we get married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are serious, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to be seventeen in a month,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I am going into the Army in six weeks. Juanita is going to be a senior this fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Jim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and my wife&rsquo;s name is Barbara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice to finally know your names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juanita said, &ldquo;Mom, please look at Larry&rsquo;s rib cage and make sure nothing is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said Barbara. &ldquo;Off with your shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took it off. She said, &ldquo;You better come by my office tomorrow so I can xray your ribs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, maam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three weeks later we had our final exams. Both of us passed. Juanita was going to be a senior, and I was graduating. She was at my graduation. We were inseparable during the next three weeks. One day, I had an appointment with my recruiter for my testing and to prepare to leave. I showed up with Juanita.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, this is my girlfriend Juanita,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry, you said she was pretty. You did not say she was drop-dead gorgeous. We will be leaving in ten minutes for your test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can Juanita come along?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four hours later I had passed my test and was leaving in two days for Richmond. I asked John which bus line and he told me, &lsquo;Trailways&rsquo;. We left immediately for the station, and I bought Juanita a round-trip ticket. We both had to work that night and then we went to a hotel. We made love all night and most of the day the next day. We went to the mall and took pictures of us together, and she kept three as did I. Juanita gave me a picture of her that night to take with me. It was her school picture. We went to the recruiting station, and John drove us to the bus station. Juanita and I boarded the bus and were in Richmond four hours later. We checked into the hotel and I ordered room service. We ate, then we made love all night long. The next day I was given my physical and sworn in. I took Juanita to the bus station and made sure she was safe. I kissed her and we started to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wont be long,&rdquo; I said, and we kissed passionately before she boarded and left.</p>
<p>I arrived in South Carolina at 2.30 am, and had to get up at 4. I was one exhausted person. I called Juanita right after dinner and we talked for my allotted time of ten minutes. I was in South Carolina for three weeks. I wrote to Juanita every day, and she wrote back. All correspondence with my parents, however, was returned. My next stop was Georgia. I was to be there for three months. I met my best friend in basic on the first day: Ernie. One day I was looking at Juanita&rsquo;s picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the hot babe?&rdquo; enquired Ernie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juanita, and she is my girl friend.&rdquo; He asked if I was going to put her picture in my locker, and I said, &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ashamed of her?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t know what we have been through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife is white,&rdquo; said Ernie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are also from Chicago, where mixed race couples are accepted,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I was beaten up during prom because my girlfriend is black. I am afraid to stir controversy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have your back,&rdquo; said Ernie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will put the picture up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two weeks after I got to boot camp, I got a letter from Juanita: &lsquo;Dear Larry, This letter is to inform you that I am pregnant. I love you. Juanita.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I showed it to Ernie. &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled. I called Barbara and asked her what size ring Juanita wore, and she told me, &lsquo;size 7&rsquo;. I went to the px and bought a wedding set. It sat in my locker for another ten weeks. On Family night, Juanita and they were there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nigger lover,&rdquo; said my drill sergeant. My company commander made him publicly apologize to myself and Juanita.</p>
<p>I took a walk with her and asked her to marry me. She cried when I got down on one knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She cried, as I was already doing, when I put the engagement ring on her finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry, I am happy for you both,&rdquo; said Ernie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ernie, will you be my best man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days before I left for Germany, Juanita and I were married. There were 151 people there including John, my recruiter, who before the wedding helped us fill out all the paper work so she could be listed as my dependent. No-one from my family showed. Three months after I arrived in Germany, Juanita and I received base housing. She came over 3 weeks later. Her parents came over for the birth of their first grandchild. I called my mother, who promptly hung up on me.</p>
<p>We spent ten years in the Army: four years in Germany, three in Colorado, then I spent two in Korea. We still live in Colorado. We are happy and we are accepted. We have 12 children and 6 grandchildren now. They were all at out house the other day as we celebrated 35 years together. I have no regrets and I am every bit a part of Juanita&rsquo;s family as she is.</p>
