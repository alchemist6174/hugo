  "articleBody": "Young Hannah’s useless mother, Michelle, informed Sean on Monday that she was needed for her work at the nursing home earlier than usual on Wednesday, as there was to be a staff meeting. It meant she would be leaving the house at 5.30pm, and would not return until after her usual shift finished: 3am. This spelled ‘opportunity’ for Sean, but also for his new friend in pedophilia, Mr Dan Hall, school teacher. He called Dan, and he was only too willing to bring forward the agreed day for his second ‘installment’ - as he euphemistically called it - with 9-year-old Hannah from Friday to Wednesday. Also, curiously Dan he asked if he might bring a couple of items with him - ‘for Hannah’ - and Sean smiled to himself at the thought of Hannah’s teacher bringing her presents. Sean rarely treated Hannah to anything out of the ordinary, and did not see it as his place anyway. Dan also asked that Hannah remain in her school clothes, with the exception of changing her school trousers for her school skirt, and not bathe or otherwise change before he got there. Sean assured him this would be the case, assuming Dan wished to enjoy a bath with the little girl again.\nDan was on the doorstep promptly at 6.00pm. Sean met him and Dan explained he had a couple of things to bring in from the car. He returned with a cot mattress, with a soft clean cover, and a large carrier bag with the name of well-known childrens store on the side. When questioned about these, Dan explained he had an idea to use the mattress on the large coffee table, so the Hannah would be better ‘displayed’, and also at an ideal height for ’examination’. The mattress would ensure her comfort. The other item was a present for Hannah ‘afterwards’. Sean smiled as he thought to himself, ‘This guy has got it bad!’ He never did quite understand pedos who claimed they could be ‘in love’ with a little girl; for Sean it was all simply about enjoying their little child bodies. Indeed, he got an extra kick from the whole concept of it ‘ruining their little lives’, and messing them up emotionally. Ironically, Dan’s romantic approach might even do this even more.\nThe men went into the living room where Hannah was working at the table. She looked up and gave her meek smile, then frowned when she saw Sean was not alone.\n“Hope that’s the homework I set you, Hannah,” chirped Dan, and Hannah replied that it was. She clearly pricked to attention a little at the arrival of her school teacher. Then her eyes flitted in thought, and glanced at Sean. Sean ignored her puzzlement: she had not expected Dan until Friday.\n“Have you nearly finished?” Dan, or ‘Mr Hall’, asked her.\n“Uh, yes, another 5 minutes,” she replied, in her meek little voice.\nShe still seemed to wonder whether this was a ‘schoolwork’ visit, or more to do with part two of what had started on Saturday. Sean had to supress a chuckle. Well… the silly bitch! - AS IF Dan was here in the house with her, with clear opportunity, for any other reason but sex! One thing he loved most about kids was the sheer niavety, even in one so accustomed to sex abuse as Hannah. ‘Innocence’ is quickly obliterated by an erect penis in the mouth, or jammed in their little cunt, but niavety remains in many ways. Children simply don’t have the same brain power and it was one of the most delicious things about the whole thing. Cute little fucking pawns of flesh they are, mused Sean.\n“Okay, you finish up, sweetie, and Sean and I will chat,” said Dan. Hannah glanced nervously at Sean, unused to being considered when ‘it’ was being planned. Sean just nodded, told her to carry on, and moved to the kitchen to get tea.\nDan followed and explained to Sean what, with Sean’s permission, he would like to do. He had been watching Hannah nearly all day, in the classroom, at play, at P.E, and wanted to experience her taste and smell after a full day. He would like her on all fours, on the coffee table, so that he could ’explore’ her from behind. He wanted Sean’s presence as it would ensure her compliance, and Sean could also play a particpant’s role if he wished. Sean agreed, and with an uncomplicated enthusiasm suggested they start. Both men finished up their tea and returned to the living room.\nHannah had finished writing, and was reading quietly at the table. Sean and Dan moved seats back from the coffee table, cleared magazines from the top and placed the cot mattress in position. Hannah watched all this from the corner of her eye. She looked genuinally curious, and if she also had a sinking feeling in her little soul then she hid it well. So she should: many a time Sean came down on her gruffly if she gave a hint of a sulk.\n“Mr.Hall - I mean Dan - would like to play some more games, Hannah. He has some ideas of his own, is that okay?” Sean said. It really didn’t matter whether it was or wasn’t, but he had realised that Dan liked the softer approach, and he would go along with it for the time being. It was ‘interesting’.\n“Hello, Hannah, are you ready?” said Dan, as he walked over to the table and hugged the child gently, as an adult ‘should’ hug a child.\n“I s’pose so,” replied Hannah who, unlike other children, knew the types of thing a hug portended.\nShe slipped off the chair as Dan lifted her. He set her on her feet and they walked to the coffee table, Hannah already starting to undo her blouse. Another awesome thing, mused Sean: seeing a child trained in the ways of sex, seeing a child who understood full well that her flat naked chest was one the important aspects of the whole thing.\n“No, no Hannah!” said Dan. “Just come over here and climb on the table. That’s it, now move round so that your bottom is at this end, and now kneel on all fours, that’s it! Great!” He sounded like he was enthusiastically directing an innocent school play. He walked next to her head, held it, lifted her face and kissed it gently. “Absolutely lovely, now we are going to play. Just relax, I won’t hurt you.” He moved back to the other end of the table, his excitement mounting as he viewed the little girl posed below him.\n“Sean, just go and stand by her head, stroke her nicely and stuff.” Dan’s lower and throatier voice gave away some of the tension and anticipation he felt. Sean hid his amusement about that too: the authoritative teacher, but nervous when it came to having sex with a child, and one of his favourite children at that.\nMoving directly behind Hannah, and out of her view, Dan quickly stripped off his shoes, socks, trousers and boxers, leaving just his t-shirt on. He was already sporting an erection, which bobbed as he knelt down behind the little girl. Hey, yet another great thing about child-sex, mused Sean: that contrast with the subtle and tender physique of a little girl with the anything-but-subtle shaft of a full-grown man. And it added a whole other dimension to be able to ‘witness it’, rather then just BE that guy. Hannah was on all fours at eye-level in front of Sean now. Her grey pleated school skirt, although not that short, nevertheless rode up to mid-thigh at the back, and from behind Dan instinctively ducked down to glance up the child’s skirt to her white cotton knickers. He looked up at Sean with a guilty half-smile after doing this, but Sean just nodded and smiled back.\nHe wasn’t sure what the hell Dan was planning exactly, much less which of the personal holes of the vulnerable 9-year-old child would be the main target, but he eagerly anticipating a long, full evening of two-man domineering sexual molestation. One thing Was for sure: Hannah was getting no choice in it, and in her tame obedience to her all-powerful elders, she knew it.\nTHE END\n",
