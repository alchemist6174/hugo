  "articleBody": "Adult Male Characters SEAN HOLLAND (35yo) is the central character. At the outset of the series, he lives with a single mother of a 9yo girl (Hannah), his primary purpose in this being so he can have a little girl on tap for sex. He has done precisely this for 18 months, but the series left off with him perhaps feeling a little ‘stale’ about Hannah. He is an unsentimental type of pedo, in it purely for lust of little girls, and cares little for their inner well-being. He wants whatever he can get, and frequently uses coercian and mild physical violence, but is not violent per se and does not wish to ‘damage’ a little girl and would certainly not approve of snuff. He prefers them willing but will gladly settle for ‘frightened’ and sad little girls. During his ‘career’, he has seriously sexually abused 7 girls ages 7-13. His favourite age is 9/10 but would ’experiment’ with as young as 4. He is slightly boy-curious but has never touched a boy yet. He is fair-haired, and quite good-looking with mediu m height and build.\nDANIEL HALL (32) is the schoolteacher of Hannah, and it turns out a closet pedo who particularly likes Hannah. He meets Sean at a parents evening, and it goes from there. As expected of a man in his position, he is a ’thinking’ type of pedo, cultured, and has a good empathy with children. He represents the more ‘romantic’ type of pedophile than Sean, and this is reflected in his growing relationship with Hannah - basically he wants the child’s love and willingness, and he cares for her feelings, but he does want to perform most hardcore acts with her. Naturally, Hannah is not the only girl in his school whom he has had eyes for, but she is the only one so far he has gotten to enjoy in any way. He is nto exclusively a pedo, and does like growm women.\nBILL SCOTT (65) is a closet pedo of many years, and stepgrandfather to a 10yo girl called Abigail, whom he has oft fantasised. His grown-up daughter was once the girlfriend of Daniel for a short time, and as the two men got to know each other they divilged their ‘pedo tendencies’. Now, years later, they got in touch and Dan invited him to ‘meet’ Hannah, whilst in return Bill shared his vast CP collection and dangled the possibility of ‘arranging’ for them to kidnap Abigail. He did not want to be actively involved in this, but wanted to watch footage of it later. He was a scout leader for a time, and buggered a 13yo boy.\nSIMON SPENCER (37) is the nastier type of pedo. He has stopped short of snuff in his career, but one feels he could be well capable of it. He served time for the random molestation of an 8yo girl on her way home. He met Sean online years ago, and they decide to meet in order to share their ‘catches’ - which means Hannah, and maybe Abigail. In return, Simon promised to expore his contacts in the pedo world to get Sean a taste of the 4-6yo ages: Simon’s favourite. He likes boasting of little Philippino girls he has ‘done’ on his travels. He was the leader in Abigail’s kidnap, where his full nature came out.\nANTHONY HEWITSON (43) Only comes into the story at parts 20-21 (and maybe thereafter). Once helped to run a pedo website (featuring live abuses of girls on cam) with Simon, which got busted. He escaped, however. Now he works with an underground illegal immigrant organization, his speciality trying to get access to daughters of illegals, the younger the better, by means such as blackmail or simple money-purchase. He may be able to provide a 6yo that Simon and Sean seek, for the payment of getting time with Hannah.\nGirl-Child Characters HANNAH (9) is the daughter of a single Mom, Michelle. She is the little girl whom Sean has enjoyed for so many months, and now Dan, Bill and Simon. She has cute thin brown hair, shoulder length, quite a pale and round sort of face: very pretty, with ocean blue eyes. You can imagine Kiera Knightly or Sharon Stone would have looked like her at 9. Basically, Hannah is a well-trained but far from happy little girl, and has experienced every type of hardcore sex act very regularly. She seems to be warming to Dan, as a sort of protector/father-figure.\nABIGAIL (10) is the stepgranddaughter of Bill, and she got kidnapped for an afternoon by Simon and Sean, and used quite traumatically. She is a lightly freckled brunette, timid-looking, not as pretty as Hannah but endearing nonetheless. Many pedos would see her as a pedo’s dream, which indeed Simon did. It is unclear what will become of her now, after the ordeal.\nCAMELIA (6) is the ’little one’ that Simon and Anthony have found for Sean. Her abuse has not started in earnest yet, and nothing is guaranteed. She is very pretty Palestinian-English half-breed, light brown skin, black hair. Like a ‘Persian princess’ - the dream of many a pedo, but too small and young for some (like Dan).\nAdult Females MICHELLE (30) is the somewhat overweight chav mother of Hannah. She has had problems in her life, including rehabilitation from drug use. Throughout most of the series she ’looks the other way’, but there are signs she is becoming more actively involved. She seems to have a thing for Dan, the teacher.\nESTHER (21) is the exceptionally sexy Palastinian illegal immigrant mother of Camelia. She was a child prostitute at 13, and now is loaning out her daughter in return for better conditions for herself, and is under threat of blackmail to cooperate.\nWhere The Story Goes From Here? - Take Your Pick A) Hannah is ‘pimped’ by Sean: this can either be via the internet, or on the streets or both. Considerations: which is safer, which would bring in more money? Would Hannah be able to tolerate it?\nB) The pedos split: Dan starts a life with Hannah and Michelle, whilst Sean takes in Esther and Camelia.\nC) There is a big bust-up between the pedos, involving arrests but your favourite character survives and continues in the story.\nD) The ring continues as a cohesive 5-man unit sharing the existing girls and finding new ones, and new men can continue joining it (ie you the reader).\nE) Some original ideal of a reader.\n",
