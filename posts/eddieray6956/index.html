  "articleBody": "Michayla and I both start stirring in my bed as morning has come. I look at Michayla and ask “how are you feeling?” She just smiles and says “fabulous.”\nShe says “I love you Uncle Ted,” I smile and say\" I love you too, Michayla.\" I ask her are you hungry and she says “yes I am starving.” I say “nothing like sex to make you hungry.” She just smiles. I say to Michayla,\" since we were not able to have a birthday party for you, why don’t we have one next weekend.\" Michayla says “cool can Katie spend the night?’ I said “if her parents say yes then it is ok with me.” Michayla smiles and then kisses me and hugs my neck, I just smile back.\nI fix us breakfast waffles and bacon with orange juice. Then Michayla asks “Uncle Ted can we make love again?” I say” yes but not until the dishes are put into the dishwasher.\" We put the dishes into the dishwasher and we head back to the bedroom. We strip down to nothing and we start kissing each other passionately. I tell Michayla to sit with her pussy on my mouth. She sits directly on my mouth and I start eating her out, it is not long before she starts moaning and rubbing her pussy on my mouth. She lets out a scream as she orgasms and I roll her over on her back and I rub my cock up and down her hairless pussy and I enter her. I start with long slow strokes and then increase the pace it is not long before I plunge into her deeper and plant my sperm into her. We lay beside each other in our afterglow of our orgasms. We hold each other and I look into her eyes and I see a love there like no other. I realize now that my niece has not just become my lover for the meantime, but that she will never marry anyone and that we will become a couple when she is older.\nWe get out of bed and I suggest that we shower to get ready for the rest of the day. Michayla acknowledges this. We shower together and we make love in the shower. Nothing is more exciting than having your cock in a preteen hairless pussy while in the shower. We get out and I dry Michaylas body. We get dressed and head downstairs.\nI say to Michayla, “Let’s plan your party.” She says “ok.” I ask her who she wants to invite besides Katie. She names off about six kids names. I say\" alright we have the guest list, what time? She says\" after school on Friday is fine with me.\" I say “how about 5pm?” Michayla says “fine with me.”\nWe make the arrangements and we print out invitations from the computer. I put them in Michaylas back pack and tell her to give them out on Monday at school. She says “no problem Uncle Ted.” We finish up our activities for the day and we go to bed early as we are worn out.\nMonday evening I receive a call from Katie’s mother confirming the details and she asks “are you sure you can handle having these two together for the weekend?” I say “absolutely.” We confirm the time and Katie’s mother says that she can ride the bus home with Michayla. About that time Michayla comes running through the door and drops her back pack in the foyer, and is squealing about something in school today. I excuse myself from the phone and turn my attention to Michayla. She comes running in and hugs my neck and says “I love you Uncle Ted” and plants a kiss on my lips.\nI say “what brought this on all of a sudden?”\nShe said “because you are the bestest Uncle in the whole wide world.”\nI ask\" do you have any homework?\" She says “a little.” I tell her to bring it in so we can get it done.\nWe get her homework done and I prepare us supper. We eat and then go to bed. Michayla climbs in on her side and I climb in on mine, I kiss her good night and then I tell her you have to sleep in your bed this weekend while Katie is here. Michayla makes a pouty face and says “do I really have to?” I say “yes.”\nThe weekend of the party is here and I go to the grocery store and get the cake and ice cream, before I go home. I decorate the house in streamers and I have games in store for the kids. At the usual time my little lover comes running into the house, this time she has Katie with her.\nShe says “Uncle Ted this is Katie, Katie this is my Uncle Ted.” I reach down to shake her hand and say “pleased to meet you.” Katie says “likewise.” Let me describe Katie, she was three inches taller than Michayla, with shoulder length brown hair and hazel eyes. She was just as beautiful as my niece; I was very smitten by her.\nMichayla had a blast with her party, I ordered Pizza from Black Jack and this killed two birds with one stone for me, dinner and a birthday party. Around 7pm the entire guest had left and I was there with two very beautiful pre-pubescent girls. I told Michayla to take Katie to her room and get ready for bed. They asked can we come back and watch television.\nI said “yes.” It was no time and both girls were back downstairs and watching television with me. We all watched television for two hours and I told the girls it was time for bed. They grumbled but finally relented.\nTwo hours after we went to bed I was awakened by a scream from Michayla. I went running to her room and she stated she had another nightmare, she even woke up Katie. I hugged Michayla and told her “you are safe here.” I held her and she was still crying after twenty minutes, she asked can we both sleep with you? What could I do, so I relented.\nBoth girls came to my room and climbed in bed with me. I held Michayla tight and tried to go to sleep. Michayla said “Uncle Ted will you make love to Katie and I?” I said “I don’t think it is a good idea.” She said “Pwease, besides Katie wants to see if you are bigger than her dad.”\nI turned to putty is her hands. I took my shorts off and both girls removed their night gowns, they did not have anything on underneath. Michayla started sucking my cock, while Katie sat on my face while I ate her pussy. It was not long before both girls were moaning. Katie started rubbing her pussy on my mouth and then she let out a soft cry as she came into my mouth. Her nectar was sweeter than Michayla’s. Both girls decided to switch positions, Katie starting sucking my cock and Michayla sat on my mouth and allowed me to eat her. It was not long before both girls were moaning again.\nThis time it was Michayla’s turn to cum and with that Katie sat up on on my stomach and lined my cock up with her pussy, and started fucking my cock into her. We both started moaning and Katie came again, while I continued to eat Michayla through a second orgasm. I did not last long as Katie was extremely tight and multiorgasmic.\nAs soon as Katie had her third orgasm I shot my cum into her pussy. As I filled Katie with my seed, she rolled off and Michayla cleaned my cock of both our fluid and she smiled. Katie turned to Michayla and said you are lucky, you uncle is bigger than my dad. It sounded like a little bit cock envy for Katie, and pride for Michayla. I looked at Michayla and she looked a little upset. I asked her what was wrong and she said she did not like sharing, I said it is ok. I said to her besides it is your turn, she beamed as she started to suck my cock back to life. Little Katie climbed onto my mouth and I started to eat her as Michayla started to fuck me.\nIt was not long before I was planting my seed into Michayla, Katie orgasmed sometime shortly thereafter. We spent most of the weekend in bed. On Sunday it was time for Katie to go home and for Michyla and I to return to our lives. I told Michayla that I liked Katie she said Katie liked me too.\nAge 7\nKatie starts spending the night more at our house. Michayla starts to become annoyed that her uncle and niece time is being imposed upon. I call for a meeting of the minds in the living room. I look at Katie and I ask her what is going on. I ask her why are you here almost all of the time.\nKatie says “mom wants a divorce from dad and is threatening to take me from my dad.”\nI look at her and say I understand, however; you have a family that loves you and you are hurting your family by being gone all the time.\" Katie starts crying, I hold her in my arms and tell her\" we love you to, but Michayla and I enjoy our together time just as much as you and your dad do.\" She says “I thought you were going to tell me you hated me”, Michayla says\" I can never hate you.\" Katie smiles as well as myself and Michayla. I tell Katie you can spend the night this weekend but I am going to help you. Katie smiles and then kisses me on the lips.\nI call Katie’s mom and ask her to come over with her husband. They do. I explain Katie’s fear and tell them that Katie is staying away from home because she does not want to be separated from her father. Katie’s mother starts crying and says to Katie, “honey I would never do that to you.”\nKatie is crying really hard now and the front of her shirt is soaked. Katie goes over and sits on her dads lap and just curls up into him and holds him for dear life. Her father starts stroking her hair to calm her and says “shhh baby it is ok, why didn’t you come to us with this?” Katie says “I was scared.”\nKatie’s parents say to me “Ted I think we need to go home and work out our differences for our daughters’ sake.”\nI say “if you wish Katie can stay here until Sunday.”\nThey say “thanks.”\nI ask Katie to let me talk to Michayla. I take Michayla to her room and tell her “Katie needs you as a friend and I think you should be one to her.”\nShe says “I will Uncle Ted.” I kiss her and say “you can have me tonight, but you have to share with Katie.” Michayla gives me the pouty face and then kisses me and says “you are the best Uncle a girl can have.” She then walks out and says to Katie, “I am sorry for being mad and jealous, but I understand how you feel about losing your father.”\nThe next week I have Michayla all to myself. The next weekend Katie calls and says she won’t be coming over as things have returned to normal at her house. I tell Michayla and she just smiles.\nAge 8\nMichayla and I are having sex regularly and she has done a good job so far keeping it a secret. One day my niece asks if her new friend Mckenzie can spend the night. I say you have to sleep in your room. She gives me a pouty face, and then hugs my neck.\nNext McKenzie comes to visit\n",

<p>Michayla had a blast with her party, I ordered Pizza from Black Jack and this killed two birds with one stone for me, dinner and a birthday party. Around 7pm the entire guest had left and I was there with two very beautiful pre-pubescent girls. I told Michayla to take Katie to her room and get ready for bed. They asked can we come back and watch television.</p>
<p>I said &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; It was no time and both girls were back downstairs and watching television with me. We all watched television for two hours and I told the girls it was time for bed. They grumbled but finally relented.</p>
<p>Two hours after we went to bed I was awakened by a scream from Michayla. I went running to her room and she stated she had another nightmare, she even woke up Katie. I hugged Michayla and told her &ldquo;you are safe here.&rdquo; I held her and she was still crying after twenty minutes, she asked can we both sleep with you? What could I do, so I relented.</p>
<p>Both girls came to my room and climbed in bed with me. I held Michayla tight and tried to go to sleep. Michayla said &ldquo;Uncle Ted will you make love to Katie and I?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is a good idea.&rdquo; She said &ldquo;Pwease, besides Katie wants to see if you are bigger than her dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned to putty is her hands. I took my shorts off and both girls removed their night gowns, they did not have anything on underneath. Michayla started sucking my cock, while Katie sat on my face while I ate her pussy. It was not long before both girls were moaning. Katie started rubbing her pussy on my mouth and then she let out a soft cry as she came into my mouth. Her nectar was sweeter than Michayla&rsquo;s. Both girls decided to switch positions, Katie starting sucking my cock and Michayla sat on my mouth and allowed me to eat her. It was not long before both girls were moaning again.</p>
<p>This time it was Michayla&rsquo;s turn to cum and with that Katie sat up on on my stomach and lined my cock up with her pussy, and started fucking my cock into her. We both started moaning and Katie came again, while I continued to eat Michayla through a second orgasm. I did not last long as Katie was extremely tight and multiorgasmic.</p>
<p>As soon as Katie had her third orgasm I shot my cum into her pussy. As I filled Katie with my seed, she rolled off and Michayla cleaned my cock of both our fluid and she smiled. Katie turned to Michayla and said you are lucky, you uncle is bigger than my dad. It sounded like a little bit cock envy for Katie, and pride for Michayla. I looked at Michayla and she looked a little upset. I asked her what was wrong and she said she did not like sharing, I said it is ok. I said to her besides it is your turn, she beamed as she started to suck my cock back to life. Little Katie climbed onto my mouth and I started to eat her as Michayla started to fuck me.</p>
<p>It was not long before I was planting my seed into Michayla, Katie orgasmed sometime shortly thereafter. We spent most of the weekend in bed. On Sunday it was time for Katie to go home and for Michyla and I to return to our lives. I told Michayla that I liked Katie she said Katie liked me too.</p>
<p><strong>Age 7</strong></p>
<p>Katie starts spending the night more at our house. Michayla starts to become annoyed that her uncle and niece time is being imposed upon. I call for a meeting of the minds in the living room. I look at Katie and I ask her what is going on. I ask her why are you here almost all of the time.</p>
<p>Katie says &ldquo;mom wants a divorce from dad and is threatening to take me from my dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I look at her and say I understand, however; you have a family that loves you and you are hurting your family by being gone all the time.&quot; Katie starts crying, I hold her in my arms and tell her&quot; we love you to, but Michayla and I enjoy our together time just as much as you and your dad do.&quot; She says &ldquo;I thought you were going to tell me you hated me&rdquo;, Michayla says&quot; I can never hate you.&quot; Katie smiles as well as myself and Michayla. I tell Katie you can spend the night this weekend but I am going to help you. Katie smiles and then kisses me on the lips.</p>
<p>I call Katie&rsquo;s mom and ask her to come over with her husband. They do. I explain Katie&rsquo;s fear and tell them that Katie is staying away from home because she does not want to be separated from her father. Katie&rsquo;s mother starts crying and says to Katie, &ldquo;honey I would never do that to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katie is crying really hard now and the front of her shirt is soaked. Katie goes over and sits on her dads lap and just curls up into him and holds him for dear life. Her father starts stroking her hair to calm her and says &ldquo;shhh baby it is ok, why didn&rsquo;t you come to us with this?&rdquo; Katie says &ldquo;I was scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katie&rsquo;s parents say to me &ldquo;Ted I think we need to go home and work out our differences for our daughters&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say &ldquo;if you wish Katie can stay here until Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They say &ldquo;thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ask Katie to let me talk to Michayla. I take Michayla to her room and tell her &ldquo;Katie needs you as a friend and I think you should be one to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She says &ldquo;I will Uncle Ted.&rdquo; I kiss her and say &ldquo;you can have me tonight, but you have to share with Katie.&rdquo; Michayla gives me the pouty face and then kisses me and says &ldquo;you are the best Uncle a girl can have.&rdquo; She then walks out and says to Katie, &ldquo;I am sorry for being mad and jealous, but I understand how you feel about losing your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next week I have Michayla all to myself. The next weekend Katie calls and says she won&rsquo;t be coming over as things have returned to normal at her house. I tell Michayla and she just smiles.</p>
<p><strong>Age 8</strong></p>
<p>Michayla and I are having sex regularly and she has done a good job so far keeping it a secret. One day my niece asks if her new friend Mckenzie can spend the night. I say you have to sleep in your room. She gives me a pouty face, and then hugs my neck.</p>
<p><em>Next McKenzie comes to visit</em></p>
