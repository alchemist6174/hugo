  "articleBody": "I have to shift my leg because it’s starting to go to sleep again. Rebecca, sitting on my lap and playing with my iPad, is beautiful and slight but she’s not weightless. I move a bit, getting comfortable (sort of), without a word of complaint from her. My rubbing her chest probably has something to do with that.\nRebecca is nine and we’ve had this kind of relationship for a while now. She and her older brother, Derek, invaded my home a while back (literally invaded). Neighborhood kids, they both, from the start, have had no problem just walking in to my house whenever they want.\nDerek is 11 and a bit odd. Sort of how I was at that age. I’m not really into boys but Derek changed that. I’ll go into this later.\nRebecca used to be wild, actually climbing onto counters, furniture, my refrigerator! I had to physically catch and restrain her to keep the house in any order! She was young enough that ‘restraining’ her by having my hands on her chest, my arms wrapped around from behind, was the best way to physically stop her without using duct tape. I naturally merged this situation with my love of girls to cop a feel, massaging her tiny buds.\nYep, I’m that kind of guy.\nWhat was unexpected was when Rebecca, caught after running wild yet-again in my kitchen, bent over and started grinding her ass into my cock. I didn’t have wood but that was changing fast! I moved us into a more explainable pose and, well, started thinking along a more direct path.\nThe iPad provided the answer (there wasn’t an app for THIS, though). Rebecca would focus entirely on the tablet and allow me to explore her body. The first time, I had caught her in the kitchen and, this time, picked her up over my shoulder. The minx snatched my iPad off the counter as I did so. She started to browse the internet as I carried her back to the living room. I stopped in front of the blowing fan (summertime) to cool us both off, holding her under her butt with my crossed arms. I moved my arms to allow more airflow. Rebecca then spread her legs a bit, probably for the same reason. Using one hand to press her body against mine, I my other started to gently massage her legs and ass. No complaints and her legs opened a little more! This continues until I’m actively rubbing her crotch through her shorts. This was the first time I could smell her arousal and I still love it. She had to go home right then but this was just the start.\nI haven’t fucked Rebecca. Not yet. She’s interested (or thinks she is) but she’s too young. She’s pretty slight and I’m just not going to hurt her to get my own rocks off. Her willing brother is a completely different story but that’s a future post.\nSo, Rebecca is on my now somewhat-comfortable leg, playing some game she’s downloaded. I’m rubbing her buds under her shirt and she is actually pushing her chest into my massaging hand. She’s a lot less wild when I’m stroking her body! I can smell her arousal now. I’m multi-tasking, massaging Rebecca while going through e-mail. Not the sexiest scene, sure, but I love this time with Rebecca. I love how she seems to almost purr her approval.\nSuddenly she looks up. “What time is it?” she asks.\nLooking at the clock on the computer, I answer, “4:50…why?”\nRebecca jumps off of my lap. “I have to go! I have First Communion tonight. We’re leaving at 5. Bye!” Then she’s gone.\nI admit it. I’m feeling like a complete ass. Feeling up an nine-year old girl right before her First Communion? I didn’t KNOW that, of course, but it still just feels like a crappy thing to do (the sexual-acts-with-kids thing is, of course, something I’m comfortable with). I’m not religious but try to respect those that are, right?\nI’m still fighting this completely unfamiliar moral battle when Rebecca walks back in the house (without knocking, of course). She picks up the iPad, settles back into my lap and, taking my hand, puts it back on her chest.\nShe looks at me and smiles. “We aren’t leaving until 5:30” is all she says before going back to her game. I begin to massage her titties again, getting that sigh of contentment that I love so much.\n",
