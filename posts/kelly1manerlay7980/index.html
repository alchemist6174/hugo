  "articleBody": "I still cannot believe this happened. It was a few years ago now but my memory is still so clear. I am married with 3 children. At the time my daughters were 11 (twins). One of daughters friends was an amazing girl. She was also 11. A little more physically advanced than my daughters at the time. Her name was kelly. She was skinny but had the makings of a figure just developing. She had remarkable athlete type legs with just the right amount of muscle. She was tall for her age and came up to my shoulder. She was blonde. She had tiny mounds for breasts but her whole chest was so defined and sexy. Her hips were slim of course but she had a beautiful shaped ass. Her parents were our friends and would often come over to visit. Sometimes Kelly would sleep over in our girls room, being friendly with my girls. I found myself very attracted to Kelly. She was vivacious and fun to be with. Always joking and very outgoing. I will tell you of the first incident which started quite innocently.\nI was sitting on the couch watching TV. It was just after Christmas as I remember the sporting event I was watching. My girls were laying on the floor looking at some stuff they got for christmas. Kelly’s mum was in the next room talking to my wife, both were sitting at the kitchen table. Kelly was sitting on the couch at the other end to me. I was very aware of her and hoped that she would be up for some fun. We used to play some tickling games, and it was common for us to touch at times innocently.\nWe would sometimes poke each other in the ribs and stuff like that. One time in Church she came up to me after the service and actually sat on my hand that was resting on the bench seat beside me. She squirmed a bit on my hand and I could feel her bum and panties. I did not try to get a “feel” at the time because I was so afraid of being seen. This was entirely initiated by her and just blew me away at the time. As we were sitting on the couch Kelly decided to lay down with her feet pointing towards me. She was watching the TV but probably not that interested in the sport.\nAt one point she rolled over onto her stomach, still facing away from me so that her feet were almost touching my legs. She was wearing gym pants. These were popular a few years ago but not so much now, they were basically very short shorts. They were skin tight made of some sort of “lycra” I guess. She had a loose fitting t-shirt on her top. I was so aware of her beautiful shapely legs now within my reach. As I looked down at her I could see her wonderful slim legs going right up to her ass which was covered by the tight-fitting shorts. Her skin was blemish free and white, smooth and untouched.\nBefore the couch she had slept over with my girls and I guess she wore that to bed. This morning I had been admiring her wonderful body dressed as she was during breakfast. I think she may have been aware of my glances but did not show any sign. I remember watching her at the kitchen table before. She had her legs spread so wide apart, not trying to be provocative just the innocence of youth. I could see her pussy outline as she stradled the chair with a bare leg on each side. her pussy looked so inviting and so “on display”. Was she aware? I don’t know. Back to the couch…I decided to innocently touch her feet and give them a rub. I was met with some very encouraging signs. She wriggled down at her end so as to have a little more contact with me.\n",
