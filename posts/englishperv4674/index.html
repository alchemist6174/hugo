  "articleBody": "“Fuck yes, fuck yes indeed,” repeated Simon, holding Abigail’s pic in his hand.\nSean chuckled. “I was afraid she might not be your type, being out of your age-range and all.”\n“Who said she’s out of my range?? Yeah, I prefer 5-year-olds these days, but I can always accommodate a sweetie like this. S’very good of this Bill of yours to offer her up.”\n“I know. He wants to stay well out of it, though. He’ll give us the directions to her walking route, and the timing of it, but the rest is up to us and we are not to let it out to her that we know Bill at all.”\n“Fair enough.”\n“Stunning,” said Simon, with a intensive smile. “Just heart-breaking!” He chuckled, shaking his head in admiration.\nAbigail had grey-blue eyes set in a fragile-looking face that was sprinkled with freckles, but not enough to take away from the smooth and fair English complexion of her skin. She did not have child-model looks, but was ‘pretty’ with the good churchy-family girl aura. This, suspected Sean, was what made her seem all the more ‘stunning’ to Simon just as it did to him. Her lips were kind of thin, with definately no lipstick, and without the pout or fatty collagen look of more ‘sexually beautiful’ children. Her hair was the most ordinary brown you could get, mousy and stringy, with a rather uneven fringe. It hung to just a bit more than shoulder-length, which was more than adequate in Sean’s book and therefore almost certainly in Simon’s too: plenty enough to get hold of when kissing her or shafting her. In the pic she had a restrained but leasant smile, as if she was just a little shy to be photographed. In all, she looked devoid of sexuality, unlike some her age - it tended to be awakening at least in an innocent way by then - and basically just an ordinary girl who was growing up very nicely. You got the impression an abduction would hit her like a giant meteor strike. BANG - her equilibrium, innocence, trust, and childhood gone in one day.\n“So, we’re gonna go for it?” checked Sean.\n“Yes, oh yes.”\n“The next opportunities would be Wednesday or Friday this week.” Today was Monday.\n“Okay,” said Simon. “Friday maybe. Wednesday a bit too hasty.”\n“I agree.”\n“So, you got any thoughts on it so far?” enquired Simon.\n“Um, a few, yes…” began Sean. He had a damn fevered lot of them, actually, and had had for several weeks since Bill told him about her.\n“So, what’s her body like?” asked Simon.\n“Just normal,” shrugged Sean. “According to Bill’s descriptions and a few pics he showed me once. Has the slightest tit-mounds starting, I think.” Sean said that almost apologetically.\n“Oh, that’s fine, just fine. I can live with that.” Simon chuckled, and Sean copied him. “Physique? Arse?”\n“Average height,” said Sean. A little taller than his own Hannah, by all accounts. No more than chest-height, though, and his heart palpitated at the thought. “Pretty thin, but no more so than you’d expect of her age, just about with signs of curves to her hips.”\n“Arse?”\n“Bill says it’s cute. The small type, but has good perkiness, from what I can tell in other pics.”\n“Well, that’s okay if it is - small I mean - that can be horny in it’s own right.”\n“I agree. My Hannah’s is maybe cuter and more bubbly, though.”\n“Can I get a shot at Hannah some time?” interjected Simon.\n“Uh, yes, of course.” Sean was just momentarily unsettled by the phrase. “Surprised you haven’t asked until now, anyway.”\n“Well, let’s stay focused on Abigail for now. This has got to be done right.”\n“Absolutely. Well, I doubt whether she has any hair,” said Sean. “Even Bill does not know, though, for sure. Says it’s 2 years since he’s seen her in the bathroom.”\n“Okay. Well…” Simon looked thoughtful, like a man figuring out a banking investment. “She’s ten… bleeds almost certainly not started yet, if her build is fairly light - it’s weight-related, you know - so by that token pussy hair will have most likely not have started, either.”\n“That’s good, yeah?”\n“Yes, Sean, that’s good.” They chuckled. “So, your thoughts on the deed?”\nSean took a breath, and a swig of beer. “Firstly, I reckon we have to get her, have our fun, and let her go within about 3 hours. Before she’s regarded as ‘missing’, I mean.”\n“Hmm, Its going to be difficult to be done with her in three hours and to get her not to talk about it, but I guess it can be done,” said Simon.\n“I was only thinking we can do without ‘heat’, and keep it quick and clean… so to speak.”\n“Ha, yeah. Good point, but I still don’t see how we can stop her talking about it - for sure.” Simon rubbed his chin as he contemplated.\n“Well, assuming we can think of a way - short of snuff of course, NOT an option - do you agree in principle 3 hours?”\n“Okay, yes. The ideal scenario for me is a long-term abduction, though, but I guess I can save that up for another girl.” He laughed.\n“I guess so.”\n“So, Sean mate, any other thoughts. I’m sure you’ve got some.”\n“Well, yeah. Um, first dibs… I’m thinking I would like first dibs on her cunt. I wanna be her first ever vaginal fuck. More often than not I’m an ass guy, but just the way she looks… I see myself on top of her, fucking her…”\n“Okay, okay,” said Simon, reflectively. “I’m good with that. If…”\n“Yeah?”\n“If in return I can have first call on both her mouth AND her arse. It’s only fair, if you’re getting the first choice, I should have the next two. Besides, the first ever breaking in of a girlie - her first ever experience of ‘any’ kind of sex - is always the most fun. For us, I mean.” They laughed.\n“Yes, I understand. Deal.”\n“Why ‘on top’, anyway?” enquired Simon.\n“Sorry?”\n“Why do you see youself on top of her, not doggy?”\n“Oh, ha, yeah. It’s just that I want to be looking into her sweet face as I do her, that’s all. Doggy is tempting, though.” They chuckled.\n“Isn’t it always?!”\n“Yes.”\n“And why is snuff not an option?”\nSean coughed a little on his drink. “Because… Bill… you know, tact, we have to consider him in this. I’m pretty sure he would not want her snuffed. Well, I know he doesn’t: ’let her go in one piece’ was how he put it to me.”\n“Only joking!” said Simon.\n“Whew.”\n“Damn, though,” continued Simon, holding her photo in front of his eyes, “I think I could freaking cum while wringing her little neck.”\n“Don’t think it!”\n“Okay.”\n“Other big issue: where do we take her?” asked Sean, rhetorically. “Bill says there’s plenty of good wild wooded cover less than half a mile away. We could just do her there, almost right away. No time wasted. Simple, clean.”\n“By ‘do’ her, you just mean ‘rape’, right?”\n“Yes.”\n“Just checking.”\n“The other option is have a hideaway somewhere, but that takes research and we don’t know that area well enough.”\n“Maybe Bill can help with that?”\n“No, he’s done enough already. I don’t want to put more pressure on him.”\n“Fair enough. Outdoors it is, then. Well, hell, it’s summer and it’ll be warm and dry.”\n“Most likely.”\n“One little thing,” said Simon.\n“Yes?”\n“Undressing. Does she strip for us, or do we rip her clothes off her? That’s kind of important to me.”\n“Huh, yeah, well I always think it’s more fun to watch her strip, especially in circumstances like this. She’s vulnerable, nervous among two strange men, on wasteland… so make her do it herself, and watch her.”\n“She’ll be more than ’nervous’, mate. Damn terrified… think about it, girls like her are dead shy speaking with any strange adult, obedient as hell with teachers, so she’ll be scared stiff when have her out there.”\n“Yes, yes, well that’s what I mean.”\n“I’m in two minds,” said Simon. “Part of me says strip her, part of me says watch her slip her own little panties off before we dive on her.”\n“You’re drunk,” said Sean.\n“Yeah, haha. I won’t be on the day, though.” He smiled crisply.\n“Well, we’d better get thinking how we can keep her from talking.”\n“Yes, we’d better.”\nTHE END\nAny feedback such as general feelings, critiques or suggestions for the story welcome in email.\nAlso, I welcome readers to ‘apply’ to become involved by BEING a new character in the story (all fiction of course), or maybe even bringing in a new girl. You would have to pick up from the current last part of the series, though.\n",

      Planning For Sweet Innocent Abigail
    </h1>
    <div class="post-description">
      This is part 16 of the Pedophile Ring series. 9yo Hannah is taking a break from the story for a while, as she has been taken on holiday by her schoolteacher/abuser, Dan. Here Sean and his hard-edged pedo buddy, Simon, discuss the abduction of the innocent 10yo Abigail, stepgranddaughter of Bill (the 3rd of Hannah&#39;s abusers). Complicated? A bit, but makes more sense if you have followed the previous stories.

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. Well, I doubt whether she has any hair,&rdquo; said Sean. &ldquo;Even Bill does not know, though, for sure. Says it&rsquo;s 2 years since he&rsquo;s seen her in the bathroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Well&hellip;&rdquo; Simon looked thoughtful, like a man figuring out a banking investment. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s ten&hellip; bleeds almost certainly not started yet, if her build is fairly light - it&rsquo;s weight-related, you know - so by that token pussy hair will have most likely not have started, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sean, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; They chuckled. &ldquo;So, your thoughts on the deed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sean took a breath, and a swig of beer. &ldquo;Firstly, I reckon we have to get her, have our fun, and let her go within about 3 hours. Before she&rsquo;s regarded as &lsquo;missing&rsquo;, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm, Its going to be difficult to be done with her in three hours and to get her not to talk about it, but I guess it can be done,&rdquo; said Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only thinking we can do without &lsquo;heat&rsquo;, and keep it quick and clean&hellip; so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, yeah. Good point, but I still don&rsquo;t see how we can stop her talking about it - for sure.&rdquo; Simon rubbed his chin as he contemplated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, assuming we can think of a way - short of snuff of course, NOT an option - do you agree in principle 3 hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, yes. The ideal scenario for me is a long-term abduction, though, but I guess I can save that up for another girl.&rdquo; He laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Sean mate, any other thoughts. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve got some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yeah. Um, first dibs&hellip; I&rsquo;m thinking I would like first dibs on her cunt. I wanna be her first ever vaginal fuck. More often than not I&rsquo;m an ass guy, but just the way she looks&hellip; I see myself on top of her, fucking her&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, okay,&rdquo; said Simon, reflectively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good with that. If&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If in return I can have first call on both her mouth AND her arse. It&rsquo;s only fair, if you&rsquo;re getting the first choice, I should have the next two. Besides, the first ever breaking in of a girlie - her first ever experience of &lsquo;any&rsquo; kind of sex - is always the most fun. For us, I mean.&rdquo; They laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand. Deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why &lsquo;on top&rsquo;, anyway?&rdquo; enquired Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you see youself on top of her, not doggy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ha, yeah. It&rsquo;s just that I want to be looking into her sweet face as I do her, that&rsquo;s all. Doggy is tempting, though.&rdquo; They chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it always?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why is snuff not an option?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sean coughed a little on his drink. &ldquo;Because&hellip; Bill&hellip; you know, tact, we have to consider him in this. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he would not want her snuffed. Well, I know he doesn&rsquo;t: &rsquo;let her go in one piece&rsquo; was how he put it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only joking!&rdquo; said Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn, though,&rdquo; continued Simon, holding her photo in front of his eyes, &ldquo;I think I could freaking cum while wringing her little neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other big issue: where do we take her?&rdquo; asked Sean, rhetorically. &ldquo;Bill says there&rsquo;s plenty of good wild wooded cover less than half a mile away. We could just do her there, almost right away. No time wasted. Simple, clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By &lsquo;do&rsquo; her, you just mean &lsquo;rape&rsquo;, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just checking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other option is have a hideaway somewhere, but that takes research and we don&rsquo;t know that area well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Bill can help with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s done enough already. I don&rsquo;t want to put more pressure on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough. Outdoors it is, then. Well, hell, it&rsquo;s summer and it&rsquo;ll be warm and dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One little thing,&rdquo; said Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undressing. Does she strip for us, or do we rip her clothes off her? That&rsquo;s kind of important to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, yeah, well I always think it&rsquo;s more fun to watch her strip, especially in circumstances like this. She&rsquo;s vulnerable, nervous among two strange men, on wasteland&hellip; so make her do it herself, and watch her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be more than &rsquo;nervous&rsquo;, mate. Damn terrified&hellip; think about it, girls like her are dead shy speaking with any strange adult, obedient as hell with teachers, so she&rsquo;ll be scared stiff when have her out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, well that&rsquo;s what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in two minds,&rdquo; said Simon. &ldquo;Part of me says strip her, part of me says watch her slip her own little panties off before we dive on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re drunk,&rdquo; said Sean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, haha. I won&rsquo;t be on the day, though.&rdquo; He smiled crisply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better get thinking how we can keep her from talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;d better.&rdquo;</p>
