  "articleBody": "I remember as a kid my cousin used to give me massages, nothing sexual mind you, but when he went away those purely innocent backrubs were gone and I had to find other body parts I could do myself. As peculiar as I am, I discovered my ass hole felt wonderful when I would rub it. For a while whenever it was mentioned that boys might play with their special private place, I had always assumed they meant my asshole until I suddenly cottoned on when kids starting talking about jerking dick, but by then I was an ass whore, hook, line and sinker.\nBy the time I was ten I was well into experimenting with what I can shove up my ass to make me feel good. With the aide of the internet, at eleven I had graduated from sharpies, fruit and other objects to dodgy internet webcam shows and eventually hook-ups with strange men.\nWhen I turned twelve my mother moved to a new area for work and we were out shopping for new groceries when I noticed a familiar guy carrying his own groceries into his pickup. He saw me and he froze. I knew that these guys went out on a limb to fuck me and to see me here in his own town probably made him shit himself. I swear I actually saw him look about for cops, like I was some sort of sting. I gave him a wink to know that I was that kid he had skewered on the end of his cock.\nLike some sort of twisted romance story, the bottom in mum’s grocery bad split open and he took the chance to be the shining knight in armour and he jumped into action catching the tins rolling down the street. I realised then that mum was flirting with him and he was flirting right back. When she wasn’t looking I saw his glances at me, I knew he wanted me, not mum, but how can you tell your mum that her new crush is actually after you, her twelve year old son. He’d end up arrested and I’d end up in therapy and never have another cock in my ass again. He fucked my mom that night. I know I could hear them fucking through the thin walls of the cheap house. I got off on the thought that the cock that was in her had been in me first. I jerked myself off and went into the bathroom to watch my watery cum off my hands.\nI heard the door click closed behind me and I turned around. There he was completely naked, his cock was covered in what must have been my own mother’s juices and his own cum. He nodded down at his cock and I knew he wanted me to suck it. It was limp and wet; not very appealing in the slightest, but if he was going to fuck me, I needed to get him hard again.\nThe head of the cock had a strange taste to it. I didn’t like it, it was like the taste when you lick a battery terminal. I reeled back at the unpleasant taste, but he placed his hands on the back of my head and pushed the cock down my throat. I gagged, not because of the cock, but the taste. He pulled back out and looked nervous as I tried to stifle a coughing fit. He knew he wasn’t going to get his cock sucked without making too much noise. Instead he turned me around and started to rub my ass with his now semi erect cock. The slime, cum and new precum on his dick was enough to get my hole to relax and he slid his fully hard cock home. He started to fuck me pretty hard against the sink, but we both knew to keep our voice down.\nHe was about to cum when the bathroom swing open and my mother barged in, buck naked. She was about to say something to the man something like ‘are you done, I need to pee,’ or something innocuous like that, but she saw her bed partner with his dick in her son.\nThe guy panicked just as he came and pulled out, giving me a cream pie and a splash up the back. He was going hysterical like his life was over.\nMy mom basically told him to shut the fuck up and stop being a girl. I was then gobsmacked when she told him. “At least last time you waited until I had gone to bed”.\nShe knew that he fucked me before.\n“You aren’t the first either.” She continued and saw my expression. “Yes,” She glared down at me like she had just caught me drinking milk directly from the carton. “I know exactly what you’ve been up to Mister.”\nI tried to proclaim my innocence as any kid would with the obvious evidence dripping from his asshole and down his back.\n“A mother always knows what his son is up to.” She grabbed a cloth and started to wipe the man’s cum off my back. “The sudden interest in long fruit and sharpies gave you away.”\nI blushed.\n“I knew it wouldn’t be long before you started seeking the real thing.” She told me as I blushed a new shade of red.\nThe man was still speechless, but my mum sorted him out too. “You’re a lucky guy.” She told him. “You get to pick the bed you want to spend the night in.”\nHe asked my mom if she was alright with this. I wanted to know the answer too.\nShe said, “I’d rather know who was fucking my son.” She actually ruffled my hair. “So I guess you two are sharing a bed, which is fine. Just keep the noise down. I don’t want to hear the bed hitting the wall while you are shoving your dick into my son.” She winked at the man.\nIt was then that I decided I had the best mom I the world.\n",
