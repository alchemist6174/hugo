  "articleBody": "I take it easy for the next few days. I stay away from Robyn and Mom and they leave me alone, too. Come Friday, I’m watching Star Trek reruns when Dad comes home from work. My dad is a civilian bureaucrat for the military and a creature of habit. Every evening, he comes home, reads the afternoon paper, lies down on the couch and takes a twenty minute nap before dinner.\nBut tonight, he came home early. That kinda pisses me off because Star Trek wasn’t over yet and it was a good one, with the Yangs and the Comms. Anyway, I go to turn it off, when Dad says, “It’s ok, Edward, you can finish watching your show.” Then he starts reading the paper.\nI look at him like he’s speaking Martian, but shrug and keep watching. The hot babe in the leather that brings Spock the communicator at the end always turns me on, so I’m a little horny when the show finished. When the credits start to roll, Dad puts down the paper and speaks up, “Edward, can you please turn off the TV now? We need to talk, man to man.”\nThat sounds ominous, my cock immediately wilts and I manage an “Ok, Dad.” I get up and turn off the TV as the 5 o’clock early news comes on.\n“Your mother told me about her, um, session with you last weekend.” He pauses for a moment, then continues. “Things are a little different in this family, as I guess you’ve figured out by now.” All I can do is nod. “Well, I suppose I should have said something to you sooner, even before we found you and Robyn together, but…” He pauses again, thinking. He picks up his pipe, fills it, and lights up while I wonder where this is going. “I’m not too good with this sort of thing, Edward, that’s why I let your mother take the lead.” He pauses and relights his pipe. Finally, he reaches into his briefcase, takes out a bag, and hands it to me. “These are a couple of good books, I think. Your mom has more. I looked thru the one on top and I think it does the job.”\nThe one on top is called “Boys \u0026 Sex.” I flipped thru it. No pictures. Another is “Everything you always wanted to know about sex.” There was one more called “Me, Too!” that was full of pictures of parents and little kids having sex! Where did he find this?? Just glancing thru it makes gives me a hard on.\n“Read thru those and if you have any questions, ask me or your mother. Your mother’s studied childhood development, so she’s probably a better resource, but I’ll answer what I can. Ok?”\n“Ok, Dad,” is all I can say. I want to take these books up to my room right away, but I don’t want Dad to see me with a hard on. Then I notice he’s hard, too. His pants are stretched way out. My God, he must be huge.\nHe notices me looking and rubs it thru his pants. “Do you want to see it?” he asks. I’m dumbstruck and just nod. He unzips his pants and pulls out a monster. It must be at least 9 inches and thick. He strokes it slowly. The head is poking out from a covering of skin. “Let me see you, son.” I unzip my jeans and pull out my cock, which looks puny compared to his. “You are developing nicely, Edward. Come over here and lets compare.”\nI get up and sit next to him on the couch. He looks at my cock as he continues to stroke his own. I don’t know what to say.\n“You see, I’m not circumcised and you are,” he says. “I’m sorry about that, I wish now, we hadn’t let the doctor do that to you when you were a baby. Oh, well.”\nHis stroking feels so good, but this is so confusing again. I glance at the door and say, “What if someone sees us?”\n“Don’t worry, your mother took Robyn shopping. I asked her to give us some time to talk, but…” He stops stroking his cock and says, “I’m sorry. If this is going too fast…”\nI start stroking my cock and mumble “No, it’s ok.” I reach over to his cock and hesitate, “Can I touch it?”\n“Sure,” he says, guiding my hand around his enormous dick. I stroke it up and down, but my hand can’t even reach around it. He moans, “That’s soo gooood, Edward.” He reaches over and plays with me, too. His hand is so warm and firm. As we jack each other, I start to moan, while Dad grunts in time with my hand on his cock. I’m getting close and moan. “Hmmm, ooohhh, Daaad” then I cum all over my stomach and his hand. That’s too much for my father, and he cums too in great looping streamers of cum that shoot up all over him and me.\nGod, what a mess. As we come down from our orgasms, I’m more than a little ashamed. Then I see the look on his face, loving, concerned, worried, and covered in cum, and I burst out laughing. I can’t help myself.\nHe looks a little cross, but then surveys the damage and grins. “We made quite a mess, Edward.” I nod, still laughing as he pulls out a white handkerchief and tries to mop up the cum. It’s all over our clothes, the couch and the carpet, even in our hair.\n“Sorry,” I offer.\n“Not your fault, son. It wasn’t supposed to happen like this, but your mother is right. You are always pushing the limits.” Lets clean this up before it dries.\nHe stands up and pulls off his cum soaked clothes, so I do too. I use my t-shirt to wipe myself as does my dad. I grab a wet washcloth and a couple of towels from the downstairs bathroom. Dad mops up the stains with one towel while I wash and dry as best I can behind him. I notice his cock has gone soft as we work, but mine is still rock hard. Luckily the couch is dark brown and hides stains, but the carpet is lighter and I notice that this wasn’t the only accident like this in the living room (and I always thought those stains were from TV dinners).\nWhen most of the damage is cleaned up, Dad says, “I need a shower, and so do you.” I nod and follow him up the stairs buck naked carrying my dirty clothes. We dump our clothes in the hamper in the hall closet. He holds the door to the bathroom and says, “You go first. Can you make it quick, I really hate cold showers. Then again,” he laughs, “one would do me good, this afternoon.”\nMy dad and I stand naked in the bathroom, arguing over who is supposed to shower first as the water heats up. Dad is 43 and a little pudgy, but pretty fit for a bureaucrat. He’s 5'10 and I’m as tall as he is by even though I’m only 12. Mom says I must be taking after my Uncle Randy who’s 6'3. The one thing that is truly memorable about Dad is his cock, which is huge. It’s at least 9 inches and thick. Dad and I just had a “discussion” about the birds and the bees that got a little out of hand and were both covered in drying cum. His cum smells different than mine, somehow earthier.\n“Fuck it,” Dad mutters and gets in as the steam begins to build. “Grab a couple of towels and a washcloth from the hall,” he orders. I haven’t seen this side (or this much of Dad), before. He is usually rather quiet, not saying much. I’m not sure I like it and I notice my cock has wilted, but I do as I’m told. I put the towels and then he opens the shower curtain and says, “Get in.” I do.\nI start to wash myself as Dad washes his hair. I’m more than a little embarrassed by all of this and want to get in and out quickly. I notice Dad is washing his cock and I pause, watching it grow hard. It is a monster. I start stroking mine, too, with my soapy hand as I begin to get hard. He strokes his slowly, watching me watching him.\n“You’re pretty big for your age, Edward,” he says looking at my hard cock. He pulls me forward into the water to rinse me off, then pushed me back against the wall and drops to his knees. “You have no idea how long I wanted to do this,” and he swallows my hard cock in one deep gulp.\n“Oh, God,” I moan as he sucks my cock in and out of his warm mouth. He swirls his thick tongue around the head as he strokes the shaft with his strong hand. He fondles my balls as he goes back to sucking me deep. He better than Robyn or Mom, that’s for sure. It’s so weird looking down at my own Dad, sucking my cock. My dad, the cocksucker, but he’s a damn good cocksucker. I close my eyes and pretend it’s Robyn sucking me. I don’t care if that’s sick, too. I’m getting close as I hear and feel Dad grunting around my cock. I open my eyes and see him jacking his own cock with a free hand. The scene is so obscene is send me over the edge. I cum hard, bucking my hips as I grab his head and fuck his incestuous mouth. He swallows my load without gagging or missing a drop. Then shakes off my hands and stands up grinning.\n“You almost taste sweet, son,” he says and kisses me. I taste myself on his tongue as he French kisses me. I don’t taste sweet, but it does taste familiar. I had tasted my own cum before out of curiosity.\nMy father pulls me around in almost a dance move, reversing our positions. As he leans up against the tiled wall of the tub, he forces me to my knees. Grabbing my head, with one hand and his monster cock in the other, he pushes it in my lips against my teeth. “Now it’s your turn.” I don’t really want to but he is kinda right, he did do me. I open my mouth and his huge cock invades my virgin mouth. I can only get about half of it in my mouth, so I stroke the rest with both hands. I do my best to keep my teeth off of his cock as he begins to thrust into my mouth. “Oh, Gooooodd, Edward. Suck my big horny dick, son.” I do my best to keep up with his thrusts as he fucks my face faster and harder.\nAfter a few minutes, I feel the water getting cold. This seems to raise the urgency of my dad’s thrusts. I start to gag as he shoves his thick hard cock deeper and deeper in my mouth and down my throat. I try to get away, but he pushes me against the back wall and slams his cock in my face harder and harder. I try to fight him off but I can’t. Finally, he groans loudly and cums hard, thrusting deep down my throat. I start to cough as his cum fills my throat and mouth, even up my nose. He finally lets me go and I fall down in the tub coughing and gasping for air. The water is freezing and I’m shaking and gasping, barely conscious. Dad reaches back and turns off the water, then steps out of the tub. He sits on a towel on the toilet seat and wipes his deflating cock with the washcloth, as I collapse on my back in the tub.\n“You ok?” he finally asks. I look at him like he’s asked if I am happy being a half drowned cocksucker. “Sorry, son. I guess I got a little carried away. But Wilma is right, you are a natural.” He gets up and wraps a towel around his waist, then offers me a hand up. I take it and he puts the other towel around my shoulders.\nI stagger out of the bathroom and down the hall to my room. I close the door and collapse on my bed. I’m still wet, but I don’t care. I spread the towel out over my pillow and pull the sheets and covers over me. I burst into tears. This is so fucked up! Why is this happening to me? Why was I born into this supremely fucked up family?? What did I do to deserve this??? I cry into my pillow, trying not to let Dad hear me. The last thing I want is for him to come in and “comfort” me. Some part of me realizes, though, that I deserve what just happened. Now I know how Robyn felt when I did it to her. Fuck me.\n",

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, your mother took Robyn shopping. I asked her to give us some time to talk, but&hellip;&rdquo; He stops stroking his cock and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. If this is going too fast&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I start stroking my cock and mumble &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s ok.&rdquo; I reach over to his cock and hesitate, &ldquo;Can I touch it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he says, guiding my hand around his enormous dick. I stroke it up and down, but my hand can&rsquo;t even reach around it. He moans, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s soo gooood, Edward.&rdquo; He reaches over and plays with me, too. His hand is so warm and firm. As we jack each other, I start to moan, while Dad grunts in time with my hand on his cock. I&rsquo;m getting close and moan. &ldquo;Hmmm, ooohhh, Daaad&rdquo; then I cum all over my stomach and his hand. That&rsquo;s too much for my father, and he cums too in great looping streamers of cum that shoot up all over him and me.</p>
<p>God, what a mess. As we come down from our orgasms, I&rsquo;m more than a little ashamed. Then I see the look on his face, loving, concerned, worried, and covered in cum, and I burst out laughing. I can&rsquo;t help myself.</p>
<p>He looks a little cross, but then surveys the damage and grins. &ldquo;We made quite a mess, Edward.&rdquo; I nod, still laughing as he pulls out a white handkerchief and tries to mop up the cum. It&rsquo;s all over our clothes, the couch and the carpet, even in our hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; I offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not your fault, son. It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen like this, but your mother is right. You are always pushing the limits.&rdquo; Lets clean this up before it dries.</p>
<p>He stands up and pulls off his cum soaked clothes, so I do too. I use my t-shirt to wipe myself as does my dad. I grab a wet washcloth and a couple of towels from the downstairs bathroom. Dad mops up the stains with one towel while I wash and dry as best I can behind him. I notice his cock has gone soft as we work, but mine is still rock hard. Luckily the couch is dark brown and hides stains, but the carpet is lighter and I notice that this wasn&rsquo;t the only accident like this in the living room (and I always thought those stains were from TV dinners).</p>
<p>When most of the damage is cleaned up, Dad says, &ldquo;I need a shower, and so do you.&rdquo; I nod and follow him up the stairs buck naked carrying my dirty clothes. We dump our clothes in the hamper in the hall closet. He holds the door to the bathroom and says, &ldquo;You go first. Can you make it quick, I really hate cold showers. Then again,&rdquo; he laughs, &ldquo;one would do me good, this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dad and I stand naked in the bathroom, arguing over who is supposed to shower first as the water heats up. Dad is 43 and a little pudgy, but pretty fit for a bureaucrat. He&rsquo;s 5'10 and I&rsquo;m as tall as he is by even though I&rsquo;m only 12. Mom says I must be taking after my Uncle Randy who&rsquo;s 6'3. The one thing that is truly memorable about Dad is his cock, which is huge. It&rsquo;s at least 9 inches and thick. Dad and I just had a &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; about the birds and the bees that got a little out of hand and were both covered in drying cum. His cum smells different than mine, somehow earthier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck it,&rdquo; Dad mutters and gets in as the steam begins to build. &ldquo;Grab a couple of towels and a washcloth from the hall,&rdquo; he orders. I haven&rsquo;t seen this side (or this much of Dad), before. He is usually rather quiet, not saying much. I&rsquo;m not sure I like it and I notice my cock has wilted, but I do as I&rsquo;m told. I put the towels and then he opens the shower curtain and says, &ldquo;Get in.&rdquo; I do.</p>
<p>I start to wash myself as Dad washes his hair. I&rsquo;m more than a little embarrassed by all of this and want to get in and out quickly. I notice Dad is washing his cock and I pause, watching it grow hard. It is a monster. I start stroking mine, too, with my soapy hand as I begin to get hard. He strokes his slowly, watching me watching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty big for your age, Edward,&rdquo; he says looking at my hard cock. He pulls me forward into the water to rinse me off, then pushed me back against the wall and drops to his knees. &ldquo;You have no idea how long I wanted to do this,&rdquo; and he swallows my hard cock in one deep gulp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God,&rdquo; I moan as he sucks my cock in and out of his warm mouth. He swirls his thick tongue around the head as he strokes the shaft with his strong hand. He fondles my balls as he goes back to sucking me deep. He better than Robyn or Mom, that&rsquo;s for sure. It&rsquo;s so weird looking down at my own Dad, sucking my cock. My dad, the cocksucker, but he&rsquo;s a damn good cocksucker. I close my eyes and pretend it&rsquo;s Robyn sucking me. I don&rsquo;t care if that&rsquo;s sick, too. I&rsquo;m getting close as I hear and feel Dad grunting around my cock. I open my eyes and see him jacking his own cock with a free hand. The scene is so obscene is send me over the edge. I cum hard, bucking my hips as I grab his head and fuck his incestuous mouth. He swallows my load without gagging or missing a drop. Then shakes off my hands and stands up grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You almost taste sweet, son,&rdquo; he says and kisses me. I taste myself on his tongue as he French kisses me. I don&rsquo;t taste sweet, but it does taste familiar. I had tasted my own cum before out of curiosity.</p>
<p>My father pulls me around in almost a dance move, reversing our positions. As he leans up against the tiled wall of the tub, he forces me to my knees. Grabbing my head, with one hand and his monster cock in the other, he pushes it in my lips against my teeth. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t really want to but he is kinda right, he did do me. I open my mouth and his huge cock invades my virgin mouth. I can only get about half of it in my mouth, so I stroke the rest with both hands. I do my best to keep my teeth off of his cock as he begins to thrust into my mouth. &ldquo;Oh, Gooooodd, Edward. Suck my big horny dick, son.&rdquo; I do my best to keep up with his thrusts as he fucks my face faster and harder.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, I feel the water getting cold. This seems to raise the urgency of my dad&rsquo;s thrusts. I start to gag as he shoves his thick hard cock deeper and deeper in my mouth and down my throat. I try to get away, but he pushes me against the back wall and slams his cock in my face harder and harder. I try to fight him off but I can&rsquo;t. Finally, he groans loudly and cums hard, thrusting deep down my throat. I start to cough as his cum fills my throat and mouth, even up my nose. He finally lets me go and I fall down in the tub coughing and gasping for air. The water is freezing and I&rsquo;m shaking and gasping, barely conscious. Dad reaches back and turns off the water, then steps out of the tub. He sits on a towel on the toilet seat and wipes his deflating cock with the washcloth, as I collapse on my back in the tub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ok?&rdquo; he finally asks. I look at him like he&rsquo;s asked if I am happy being a half drowned cocksucker. &ldquo;Sorry, son. I guess I got a little carried away. But Wilma is right, you are a natural.&rdquo; He gets up and wraps a towel around his waist, then offers me a hand up. I take it and he puts the other towel around my shoulders.</p>
<p>I stagger out of the bathroom and down the hall to my room. I close the door and collapse on my bed. I&rsquo;m still wet, but I don&rsquo;t care. I spread the towel out over my pillow and pull the sheets and covers over me. I burst into tears. This is so fucked up! Why is this happening to me? Why was I born into this supremely fucked up family?? What did I do to deserve this??? I cry into my pillow, trying not to let Dad hear me. The last thing I want is for him to come in and &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; me. Some part of me realizes, though, that I deserve what just happened. Now I know how Robyn felt when I did it to her. Fuck me.</p>
