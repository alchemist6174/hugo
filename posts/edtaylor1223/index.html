  "articleBody": "I carry Stephanie to the bathroom to clean her up. I throw her cum stained t-shirt in the hamper and start the bath. Were both covered in cum and her pure pussy juice, so I climb in with her. She sits between my legs facing me. It seems my cock is her new favorite bath toy. She plays with it and it starts gets hard yet again. My cock has been getting more action in the last few days than it has in years and it’s getting quite sore. So, I turn her around away from my cock and keep her busy washing her hair. I picked up some baby shampoo when I was out earlier and use it to wash my cum out of her hair. She giggles when I put some in my hair too. “Branka, you’re not a baby!”\nYou’re not much of a baby either, I think but ask, “Wanna help me?” and lean forward as we wash each other’s hair. I stand her up and use the baby shampoo to wash her body, too. I run my hands up and down her soapy smooth skin. I have to spend some extra time, I tell myself, cleaning the dried cum and juices off her crotch and legs.\nMy cock springs to life again as I slide my index finger deep inside her hot tight pussy. I slide my soapy middle in her tight hot ass, which loosens quickly to the intruder. “Oh, Branka,” she moans and humps my fingers as they slide deeper, harder and faster inside her. Her ass is so accommodating, I must not be the first to explore it. I slide another finger up her tight little rosebud as she massages her own tiny clit.\nMy cock is so hard it hurts, but I don’t care. I pull out my fingers and pick up my little granddaughter. She grabs my dick in her hand as I point it at her soapy little rosy asshole. She slides down on it, moaning. She grunts as her perfect little ass cheeks land on my thighs. Looks up at me and grins. I pick her up by her tiny ass and pump my straining cock with her hot tight ass.\nGod, I think, I am going to end up in Hell with Dagny, but I don’t care. Stephanie plays with her little clit as I fuck her ass slowly and deeply. My pace pick up as I pound her down faster and harder. She grunts each time she slams down, but starts to moan too. Her little fingers fly over her clit as I almost masturbate myself with her hot little body. She begins to wail as she cums, going rigid in my arms. I can’t stand it and slam her down one last time and explode deep in her bowels. I feel her little muscles spasm as we both cum hard.\nWe are both wet soapy messes when we’re done. I am glad I used baby shampoo on both of us. I lift her off of me and my incestuous cum oozes out of her gaping asshole. We both stand up and I wash us both off with the shower massage. I set the shower to pulse and do my best to wash out her slowly closing ass. She giggles at the sensation then gasps when the pulses hit her little clit. I try to move it away but she grabs my hand and holds it there. She rides the water until she is shaking in yet another violent orgasm. I am amazed that a girl so young can actually cum, but I guess she’s not so young in many ways.\nThe water is running quite cold by the time she finally lets me turn it off. I’m used to cold showers from my time in the army, not to mention a few too many years alone, but Steph is shivering. I wrap her in a fluffy brown towel that reaches from shoulder to ankle of her little body. I put a hand towel around her hair, then carry her to our bed. I tuck her under the comforter and ask “warm enough?” She nods. I add “I’ll be right back.”\nI finish drying myself and pull on a clean robe. My hair hasn’t been this soft in years. I am going to have to keep using that baby shampoo. My cock hasn’t been this “clean” either.\nI grab her clean clothes from the laundry room along with some little girl panties I picked up with the baby shampoo this morning. When I get back to the bed, she has fallen asleep again. I leave the clothes on the bed next to her and get dressed myself.\nI am making a late lunch for us when I hear a knock at the door. It’s a cop and a woman in a severe pantsuit. I recognize the cop from one of the videos. I open the door and smile. “Afternoon Officer Brown, Ma’am. How can I help you?”\nThe officer gives me an odd look when I say his name, but says nothing. “I’m Kathy Pander, with Child Protective Services. May we come in?” the pantsuit asks.\n“Of course, of course,” I say and lead them into the living room. They sit on the couch as I say, “I was just making a late lunch. Can I get you something? Coffee, sandwich, anything?”\n“Let me get to the point, Mr. Taylor. As we understand it, you have Dagny Smith’s daughter Stephanie here with you?”\n“Yes, she is taking a nap.”\n“May we see her?”\n“Of course,” I get up and take them down the hall. “This has been a rough couple of days for her. She’s been having nightmares and hasn’t been sleeping alone.” I open the door to my bedroom, and, thank god, she is still under the covers. The hand towel has fallen off her hair, but she is still asleep.\n“I see,” says the pantsuit. She looks around briefly, but doesn’t wake Stephanie.\nI show pantsuit Stephanie’s room. She just nods and turns to me, “I am concerned for the welfare of the child, we’ve had some reports of abuse.”\n“Really?” I look at Officer Brown of CplBrown.avi square in the eye, he looks away. “I’m not that surprised, knowing her mother.” I lead them back to the living room. I sit down in my armchair and continue, “Her mother was a piece of work, but I have always done my best to take care of my granddaughter.”\n“My only concern is for the child,” the pantsuit says as she pulls out a folder from her large purse. “Our files indicate a history of neglect and physical abuse. There have even been unconfirmed reports of sexual abuse.”\n“My God, that’s terrible.” I breathe, but I don’t add if you want confirmation, just turn to your left. I remember Officer Brown quite liking a rather torrid threesome between him, mother and daughter. Come to think of it, he was rather fond of Steph’s little brown rosebud, too. “Well, I did my best to take care of Stephanie when she visited here. I always fed and cleaned her up as best I could. I offered to let Stephanie live with me several times, but Dagny never agreed.” I seem to recall Officer Brown paid double in the video for the unholy threesome. “Perhaps some good will come of this tragedy after all. I am happy to take care of Stephanie full time now.”\n“Let me see, Stephanie is not a blood relation, is she, Mr. Taylor?”\n“No, but I am the closest she has to family with her mother and grandmother gone.”\n“What about the father?”\n“I don’t think Dagny ever knew. She was a prostitute at the time. I think Steph’s birth certificate has no father listed.” I smile, thinking of the second coming, or is that second cumming?\n“You find that amusing, Mr. Taylor?”\nI decide to lay it on a little thick, “Well, sorry, I was just thinking that Our Lord and Savior would have the same problem. No father listed on his birth certificate, either”\n“I see,” the pantsuit responds, nonplussed. She must be a good feminist. “It is my job to decide what happens to this abused little girl. She has been taken into state custody before.”\n“Look, I’m not sorry about my faith. I, too, am very worried about the damage done to this little girl by her sinful mother and while she was in foster care. The one time she was put in foster care, I took custody of her then, too. I must say I was shocked at her condition when I got her. Her mother said you people did it to her, but, quite frankly, I don’t know.\n“After that, I did my best by Stephanie when her mother was alive and I will do everything for her now that I am her only support. I intend to take good care of her, make sure she never has to want or worry again. I make a good living with my business and I have already looked into adding her to my health insurance. I will get her whatever medical treatment she needs after the living hell her mother put her through. The last thing she needs is to be thrown back into the state foster care system. The stories I’ve seen in the papers about abuse there make me cringe. I will raise Stephanie in a good Christian home.”\nMy voice has risen a bit during this minor tirade and we all hear a “Branka??” from down the hall. I get up and almost run to Stephanie.\nI am pulling her clothes on her sleepy little body as the pantsuit sticks her nose in the bedroom door. Steph notices her and gasps, then wraps her arms around me as I pull her t-shirt down. “It’s okay, darling. This is Ms Pander. She’s here to see if you are okay.”\nI pick her up and she buries her face in my shoulder. I notice her hair is a mess, so I grab a hairbrush and carry her down the hall to the living room. We all sit down with Steph in my lap. “It’s okay, darling,” I say to Stephanie, “The nice lady is from Foster Care.”\nAt the words Foster Care, Stephanie burst into tears crying “Noooo!” and she latches onto me hard, sobbing.\nI stroke Steph’s tangled hair and look over at the pantsuit. “That’s okay, darling, you can stay with me.”\n“Real-ly?” she chokes out between sobs.\n“Can she, Ms. Pander?” I ask the pantsuit.\nThe pantsuit looks once at Officer Brown, who has said exactly nothing thru all of this. “Well, you have a clean, well kept and suitable home, and you are gainfully employed, Mr. Taylor. The child does seem emotionally attached to you. I will make a preliminary adjudication that she be assigned to you.”\n“You hear that, darling? You can stay with me.” I tell Steph.\nStephanie nods and kisses me. I turn my head so she kisses me on the cheek.\nWe stand up, with Stephanie still clinging to me. I show them to the door and thank them for coming. As the pantsuit walks back to their car, touch Officer Brown on the shoulder delaying him at the door. “I am so glad you came to see Stephanie again,” I tell him. “I do hope you won’t have to see Stephanie for a third time,” I give him a knowing look. “I found some very interesting home videos that my daughter made.” I hadn’t had a chance to copy the video files, but Officer Brown doesn’t know that. “My attorney found them most interesting, too, but he agreed that keeping them locked away is the best for everyone. Don’t you agree?”\nHe scowls at me and nods, not saying a word, then hurries after the pantsuit.\nAs soon as they are gone, I feed Stephanie the now stale sandwich I made her. She gobbles it down without even a strange look. I leave her at the table and make good on my word to Officer Brown. I zip up a few of the videos, Officer Brown, the ADA, the Captain and all the others, and e-mail them to my attorney with the subject “Open in the case of my death.” I then make a full backup of the files onto several DVDs.\nAfter the late lunch, Steph and I go out shopping for the essentials of life, clothes, toys and more food. I also stop by my bank and leave a set of DVDs in my safety deposit box, then FedEx a full set to my lawyer.\nAfter dropping our purchases at home, Steph and I do the town as only a four-year-old can: Chuck-E-Cheeses for dinner and the latest Pixar movie. Steph is falls asleep halfway thru the movie and I carry her to the car at the end. I put her to bed in her own room when we get home, then crash myself. Not half an hour later she wakes up screaming, so I carry her to my bed again. She falls asleep in the crook of my arm sucking her thumb and holding my cock.\nJust as I fall asleep, Stephanie wakes up screaming in my ear. I pull her close and she quiets down to a whimper. As she calms down, she grabs my cock again and grinds her slick little cunt against my hip. I don’t quite know what to do with her to get her to sleep. I let her stroke my lengthening cock as I slide a finger deep inside her dripping cunt and thumb her stiff little clit. Once she has me hard, she climbs on top of me and impales herself on me in one slow thrust. I grab her little hips and fuck her up and down my rock hard cock. One of her hands strokes her clit while the other pinches her tiny nipples. This unexpected sight of a little girl pleasuring herself and me is incredibly erotic. With each stroke I seem to sink deeper into her hot wet cunt. I am amazed when she bottoms out, taking all of me in her not so tiny cunt. Her cervix bumps the head of my cock at the bottom of each stroke and I don’t last long. She is enjoying herself too and cums quickly. Her hot little vagina ripples with passion as she goes stiff in my arms, almost keening as she twists one of her nipples tighter and tighter. It is all too much for me and I cry out, exploding in deep in her wanton cunt, filling it with a grandfather’s seed. I slam her deeper and harder down on my cock and thrust up into her with each spurt. She just groans as wave after wave or orgasm spasms thru her tiny body. Finally she collapses on me as I let go of her hips. I leave her on top of me, still impaled on my cock. Pulling the covers over us, I notice she has fallen fast asleep.\nThankfully, she sleeps thru the rest of the night.\n",

<p>We are both wet soapy messes when we&rsquo;re done. I am glad I used baby shampoo on both of us. I lift her off of me and my incestuous cum oozes out of her gaping asshole. We both stand up and I wash us both off with the shower massage. I set the shower to pulse and do my best to wash out her slowly closing ass. She giggles at the sensation then gasps when the pulses hit her little clit. I try to move it away but she grabs my hand and holds it there. She rides the water until she is shaking in yet another violent orgasm. I am amazed that a girl so young can actually cum, but I guess she&rsquo;s not so young in many ways.</p>
<p>The water is running quite cold by the time she finally lets me turn it off. I&rsquo;m used to cold showers from my time in the army, not to mention a few too many years alone, but Steph is shivering. I wrap her in a fluffy brown towel that reaches from shoulder to ankle of her little body. I put a hand towel around her hair, then carry her to our bed. I tuck her under the comforter and ask &ldquo;warm enough?&rdquo; She nods. I add &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I finish drying myself and pull on a clean robe. My hair hasn&rsquo;t been this soft in years. I am going to have to keep using that baby shampoo. My cock hasn&rsquo;t been this &ldquo;clean&rdquo; either.</p>
<p>I grab her clean clothes from the laundry room along with some little girl panties I picked up with the baby shampoo this morning. When I get back to the bed, she has fallen asleep again. I leave the clothes on the bed next to her and get dressed myself.</p>
<p>I am making a late lunch for us when I hear a knock at the door. It&rsquo;s a cop and a woman in a severe pantsuit. I recognize the cop from one of the videos. I open the door and smile. &ldquo;Afternoon Officer Brown, Ma&rsquo;am. How can I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer gives me an odd look when I say his name, but says nothing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Kathy Pander, with Child Protective Services. May we come in?&rdquo; the pantsuit asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; I say and lead them into the living room. They sit on the couch as I say, &ldquo;I was just making a late lunch. Can I get you something? Coffee, sandwich, anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get to the point, Mr. Taylor. As we understand it, you have Dagny Smith&rsquo;s daughter Stephanie here with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is taking a nap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I get up and take them down the hall. &ldquo;This has been a rough couple of days for her. She&rsquo;s been having nightmares and hasn&rsquo;t been sleeping alone.&rdquo; I open the door to my bedroom, and, thank god, she is still under the covers. The hand towel has fallen off her hair, but she is still asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; says the pantsuit. She looks around briefly, but doesn&rsquo;t wake Stephanie.</p>
<p>I show pantsuit Stephanie&rsquo;s room. She just nods and turns to me, &ldquo;I am concerned for the welfare of the child, we&rsquo;ve had some reports of abuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; I look at Officer Brown of CplBrown.avi square in the eye, he looks away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that surprised, knowing her mother.&rdquo; I lead them back to the living room. I sit down in my armchair and continue, &ldquo;Her mother was a piece of work, but I have always done my best to take care of my granddaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My only concern is for the child,&rdquo; the pantsuit says as she pulls out a folder from her large purse. &ldquo;Our files indicate a history of neglect and physical abuse. There have even been unconfirmed reports of sexual abuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, that&rsquo;s terrible.&rdquo; I breathe, but I don&rsquo;t add if you want confirmation, just turn to your left. I remember Officer Brown quite liking a rather torrid threesome between him, mother and daughter. Come to think of it, he was rather fond of Steph&rsquo;s little brown rosebud, too. &ldquo;Well, I did my best to take care of Stephanie when she visited here. I always fed and cleaned her up as best I could. I offered to let Stephanie live with me several times, but Dagny never agreed.&rdquo; I seem to recall Officer Brown paid double in the video for the unholy threesome. &ldquo;Perhaps some good will come of this tragedy after all. I am happy to take care of Stephanie full time now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see, Stephanie is not a blood relation, is she, Mr. Taylor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I am the closest she has to family with her mother and grandmother gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Dagny ever knew. She was a prostitute at the time. I think Steph&rsquo;s birth certificate has no father listed.&rdquo; I smile, thinking of the second coming, or is that second cumming?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You find that amusing, Mr. Taylor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I decide to lay it on a little thick, &ldquo;Well, sorry, I was just thinking that Our Lord and Savior would have the same problem. No father listed on his birth certificate, either&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; the pantsuit responds, nonplussed. She must be a good feminist. &ldquo;It is my job to decide what happens to this abused little girl. She has been taken into state custody before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m not sorry about my faith. I, too, am very worried about the damage done to this little girl by her sinful mother and while she was in foster care. The one time she was put in foster care, I took custody of her then, too. I must say I was shocked at her condition when I got her. Her mother said you people did it to her, but, quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, I did my best by Stephanie when her mother was alive and I will do everything for her now that I am her only support. I intend to take good care of her, make sure she never has to want or worry again. I make a good living with my business and I have already looked into adding her to my health insurance. I will get her whatever medical treatment she needs after the living hell her mother put her through. The last thing she needs is to be thrown back into the state foster care system. The stories I&rsquo;ve seen in the papers about abuse there make me cringe. I will raise Stephanie in a good Christian home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My voice has risen a bit during this minor tirade and we all hear a &ldquo;Branka??&rdquo; from down the hall. I get up and almost run to Stephanie.</p>
<p>I am pulling her clothes on her sleepy little body as the pantsuit sticks her nose in the bedroom door. Steph notices her and gasps, then wraps her arms around me as I pull her t-shirt down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, darling. This is Ms Pander. She&rsquo;s here to see if you are okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pick her up and she buries her face in my shoulder. I notice her hair is a mess, so I grab a hairbrush and carry her down the hall to the living room. We all sit down with Steph in my lap. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, darling,&rdquo; I say to Stephanie, &ldquo;The nice lady is from Foster Care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the words Foster Care, Stephanie burst into tears crying &ldquo;Noooo!&rdquo; and she latches onto me hard, sobbing.</p>
<p>I stroke Steph&rsquo;s tangled hair and look over at the pantsuit. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, darling, you can stay with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real-ly?&rdquo; she chokes out between sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can she, Ms. Pander?&rdquo; I ask the pantsuit.</p>
<p>The pantsuit looks once at Officer Brown, who has said exactly nothing thru all of this. &ldquo;Well, you have a clean, well kept and suitable home, and you are gainfully employed, Mr. Taylor. The child does seem emotionally attached to you. I will make a preliminary adjudication that she be assigned to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear that, darling? You can stay with me.&rdquo; I tell Steph.</p>
<p>Stephanie nods and kisses me. I turn my head so she kisses me on the cheek.</p>
<p>We stand up, with Stephanie still clinging to me. I show them to the door and thank them for coming. As the pantsuit walks back to their car, touch Officer Brown on the shoulder delaying him at the door. &ldquo;I am so glad you came to see Stephanie again,&rdquo; I tell him. &ldquo;I do hope you won&rsquo;t have to see Stephanie for a third time,&rdquo; I give him a knowing look. &ldquo;I found some very interesting home videos that my daughter made.&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to copy the video files, but Officer Brown doesn&rsquo;t know that. &ldquo;My attorney found them most interesting, too, but he agreed that keeping them locked away is the best for everyone. Don&rsquo;t you agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scowls at me and nods, not saying a word, then hurries after the pantsuit.</p>
<p>As soon as they are gone, I feed Stephanie the now stale sandwich I made her. She gobbles it down without even a strange look. I leave her at the table and make good on my word to Officer Brown. I zip up a few of the videos, Officer Brown, the ADA, the Captain and all the others, and e-mail them to my attorney with the subject &ldquo;Open in the case of my death.&rdquo; I then make a full backup of the files onto several DVDs.</p>
<p>After the late lunch, Steph and I go out shopping for the essentials of life, clothes, toys and more food. I also stop by my bank and leave a set of DVDs in my safety deposit box, then FedEx a full set to my lawyer.</p>
<p>After dropping our purchases at home, Steph and I do the town as only a four-year-old can: Chuck-E-Cheeses for dinner and the latest Pixar movie. Steph is falls asleep halfway thru the movie and I carry her to the car at the end. I put her to bed in her own room when we get home, then crash myself. Not half an hour later she wakes up screaming, so I carry her to my bed again. She falls asleep in the crook of my arm sucking her thumb and holding my cock.</p>
<p>Just as I fall asleep, Stephanie wakes up screaming in my ear. I pull her close and she quiets down to a whimper. As she calms down, she grabs my cock again and grinds her slick little cunt against my hip. I don&rsquo;t quite know what to do with her to get her to sleep. I let her stroke my lengthening cock as I slide a finger deep inside her dripping cunt and thumb her stiff little clit. Once she has me hard, she climbs on top of me and impales herself on me in one slow thrust. I grab her little hips and fuck her up and down my rock hard cock. One of her hands strokes her clit while the other pinches her tiny nipples. This unexpected sight of a little girl pleasuring herself and me is incredibly erotic. With each stroke I seem to sink deeper into her hot wet cunt. I am amazed when she bottoms out, taking all of me in her not so tiny cunt. Her cervix bumps the head of my cock at the bottom of each stroke and I don&rsquo;t last long. She is enjoying herself too and cums quickly. Her hot little vagina ripples with passion as she goes stiff in my arms, almost keening as she twists one of her nipples tighter and tighter. It is all too much for me and I cry out, exploding in deep in her wanton cunt, filling it with a grandfather&rsquo;s seed. I slam her deeper and harder down on my cock and thrust up into her with each spurt. She just groans as wave after wave or orgasm spasms thru her tiny body. Finally she collapses on me as I let go of her hips. I leave her on top of me, still impaled on my cock. Pulling the covers over us, I notice she has fallen fast asleep.</p>
<p>Thankfully, she sleeps thru the rest of the night.</p>
